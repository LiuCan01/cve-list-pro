URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-1999-0667

Category: SF

The ARP protocol allows any host to spoof ARP replies and poison the
ARP cache to conduct IP address spoofing or a denial of service.


Current Votes:

   MODIFY(1) Stracener
   NOOP(2) Baker, Christey
   REJECT(1) Frech

Voter Comments:
 Stracener> Add Ref: BUGTRAQ:19970919 Playing redir games with ARP and ICMP
 Frech> Cannot proceed without a reference. Too vague, and resembles XF:netbsd-arp:
   CVE-1999-0763: NetBSD on a multi-homed host allows ARP packets on one
   network to modify ARP entries on another connected network.
   CVE-1999-0764: NetBSD allows ARP packets to overwrite static ARP entries.
   Will reconsider if reference provides enough information to render a
   distinction.
 Christey> This particular vulnerability was exploited by an attacker
   during the ID'Net IDS test network exercise at the SANS
   Network Security '99 conference.  The attacker adapted a
   publicly available program that was able to spoof another
   machine on the same physical network.
   
   See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=87602880019797&w=2
   for the Bugtraq reference that Tom Stracener suggested.
   This generated a long thread on Bugtraq in 1997.
 Blake> I'll second Tom's request to add the reference, it's a very
   posting good and the vulnerability is clearly derivative of
   the work.
   
   (I do recall talking to the guy and drafting a description.)
