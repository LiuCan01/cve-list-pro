Phase: Proposed (19990721)
Category: CF

A Windows NT system's registry audit policy does not log an event
success or failure for non-critical registry keys.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Baker, Shostack, Wall
   MODIFY(2) Frech, Ozancin
   REJECT(1) Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Ozancin> Again only failure may be of interest. It would be impractical to wad
   through the incredibly large amount of logging that this would generate. It
   could overwhelm log entries that you might find interesting.
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]
 Frech> XF:nt-object-audit(228)
