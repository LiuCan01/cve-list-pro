Voter Comments:
 Cole> This can cause code to be executed.
 Frech> XF:sol-kcms-conf-netpath-bo
 Dik> the bug has nothing to do with kcms_configure; it's a bug
   in libnsl.so.  All set-uid executables that trigger this code path are
   vulnerable.  Sun bug 4295834; fixed in Solaris 8.
 Prosser> Okay, I am confused.  Based on Casper's comments and checking
   on the Sun patch site, I found the 4295834 bug(4295834 NETPATH security
   problem in libnsl) fixed in  SunOS 5.4, Patch 101974-37(x86) 101973 (sparc).
   Multiple libnsl vulnerabilities was first reported in an 98 Sun Bulletin
   #00172 for 5.4 up through 2.6.   Was this NETPATH a problem that resurfaced
   in 7 (looks like in 5.4 as well) and was fixed in 8?
 Christey> Need to dig up my offline email on this.
 Christey> May be a duplicate of CVE-1999-0321, whose sole reference
   (XF:sun-kcms-configure-bo) no longer exists.  Also examine
   BID:452 and
   BUGTRAQ:19981223 Merry Christmas to Sun! (Was: L0pht NFR N-Code
   Modules Updated)
   
   which are the same as XF:sol-kcms-conf-p-bo(3652), which could
   be the new name for XF:sun-kcms-configure-bo.
