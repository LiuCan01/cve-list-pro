Voter Comments:
 Wall> Don't know what this is.  Don't think it is a vulnerability and would
   initially reject.  This is different than just renaming the
   administrator account.
 Frech> Would appreciate more information on this one, as in a reference.
 Blake> Reference: XF:nt-autologin
 Ozancin> Needs more detail
 Baker> I tried to find the XF:nt-autologin reference, and got no matching records from their search engine.
   No refs, no details, should reject
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]
 Frech> XF:nt-autologon(5)
