Voter Comments:
 Shostack> Is this a default alias?  Is my .procmailrc an instance of this?
 Christey> It is not entirely clear whether the simple fact that an alias
   pipes into a program should be considered a vulnerability.  It
   all depends on the behavior of that particular program.  This
   is one of a number of configuration-related issues from the
   "draft" CVE that came from vulnerability scanners.  In
   general, when we get to general configuration and "policy,"
   it becomes more difficult to use the current CVE model to
   represent them.  So at the very least, this candidate (and
   similar ones) should be given close consideration and
   discussion before being added to the official CVE list.
   
   Because this candidate is related to general configuration
   issues, and we have not completely determined how to handle
   such issues in CVE, this candidate cannot be promoted to an
   official CVE entry until such issues are resolved.
