Voter Comments:
 Shostack> fingerd allows redirection
   This is a larger modification, since there are two applications of the 
   vulnerability, one that I can finger anonymously, and the other that I 
   can finger bomb anonymously.
 Frech> XF:finger-bomb
 Christey> need more refs
 Baker> This should be merged with 1999-0105
