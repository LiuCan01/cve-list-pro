Voter Comments:
 Prosser> but so far can find no reference to this one
 Frech> Our records indicate that this does not necessarly affect just wu-ftp (ie,
   also affects IIS FTP server).
 Christey> The references for XF:ftp-pwless are not specific enough,
   e.g. in terms of version numbers.  Perhaps this candidate
   should be rejected due to insufficient information.
