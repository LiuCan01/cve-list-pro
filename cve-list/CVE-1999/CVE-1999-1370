Reference: NTBUGTRAQ:19990323 MSIE 5 installer disables screen saver
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=ntbugtraq&m=92220197414799&w=2

The setup wizard (ie5setup.exe) for Internet Explorer 5.0 disables (1)
the screen saver, which could leave the system open to users with
physical access if a failure occurs during an unattended installation,
and (2) the Task Scheduler Service, which might prevent the scheduled
execution of security-critical programs.
