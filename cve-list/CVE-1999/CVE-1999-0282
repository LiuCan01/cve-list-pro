Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:sun-loadmodule
   XF:sun-modload (CERT CA-93.18 very old!)
 Prosser> Believe the reference given, 95-12,  is referencing a later
   loadmodule(8) setuid problem in the X11/NeWS windowing system.  There is an
   earlier, similar setuid vulnerability in the CA-93.18, CIAC G-02 advisories
   for the SunOS 4.1.x/Solbourne and OpenWindow 3.0.  In fact, there may be the
   same as the HP patches are 100448-02 for the 93 loadmodule/modload
   vulnerability and 100448-03 for the 95 loadmodule vulnerability which
   normally indicated a patch update.  Looks like the original patch either
   didn't completely fix the problem or it resurfaced in X11 NeWS.  Can't tell
   much beyond that and this is my opinion only as have no way to check it.  
   Which one is this CVE referencing?  I accept both.
 Dik> There are three similar Sun bug ids associated with the patches.
   1076118 loadmodule has a security vulnerability
   1148753 loadmodule has a security vulnerability
   1222192 loadmodule has a security vulnerability
   as well as:
   1137491
   Ancient stuff.
 Christey> Add period to the end of the description.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> This is distinct from CVE-1999-1584 - CVE-1999-1584 is for
   CA-93.18.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Christey> This candidate combines two separate issues.  It uses the CERT
   alert reference from 1995, from one issue, but a description that
   is associated with a separate issue.
