A Windows NT account policy for passwords has inappropriate,
security-critical settings, e.g. for password length, password age, or
uniqueness.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Shostack, Wall
   MODIFY(2) Baker, Frech
   RECAST(2) Northcutt, Ozancin

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> inappropriate implies there is appropriate.  As a guy who has been
   monitoring
   networks for years I have deep reservations about justiying the existance
   of any fixed cleartext password. For appropriate to exist, some "we" would 
   have to establish some criteria for appropriate passwords.
 Baker> Perhaps this could be re-worded a bit.  The CVE CVE-1999-00582
   specifies "...settings for lockouts".  To remain consistent with the
   other, maybe it should specify "...settings for passwords" I think
   most people would agree that passwords should be at least 8
   characters; contain letters (upper and lowercase), numbers and at
   least one non-alphanumeric; should only be good a limited time 30-90
   days; and should not contain character combinations from user's prior
   2 or 3 passwords.
   Suggested rewrite - 
   A Windows NT account policy does not enforce reasonable minimum
   security-critical settings for passwords, e.g. passwords of sufficient
   length, periodic required password changes, or new password uniqueness
 Ozancin> What is appropriate?
