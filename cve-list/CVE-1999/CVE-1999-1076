Idle locking function in MacOS 9 allows local users to bypass the
password protection of idled sessions by selecting the "Log Out"
option and selecting a "Cancel" option in the dialog box for an
application that attempts to verify that the user wants to log out,
which returns the attacker into the locked session.
