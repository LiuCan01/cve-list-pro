Phase: Proposed (20010912)
Category: CF
Reference: BUGTRAQ:19991116 Re: FormHandler.cgi
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/34939

Default configuration in Matt Wright FormHandler.cgi script allows
arbitrary directories to be used for attachments, and only restricts
access to the /etc/ directory, which allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files via the reply_message_attach attachment parameter.

   *could* be configured to limit hard-coded pathnames to a single
   directory which, while being an information leak, would still be
   "reasonably secure."  But by default, it's just not configured that
   way.
   
   My brain hurts too much right now.  There are a couple
   problems with the references and descriptions of CVE-1999-1050
   and CVE-1999-1051.  I'm interpreting the underlying nature
   of the problem(s) a little differently than others are.
   Some of it may be due to differing definitions or thoughts
   about what "directory traversal vulnerabilities" are.
