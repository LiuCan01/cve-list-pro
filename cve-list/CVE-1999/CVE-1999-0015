 Frech> XF: teardrop-mod
 Christey> Not sure how many separate "instances" of Teardrop there are.
   See: CVE-1999-0015, CVE-1999-0104, CVE-1999-0257, CVE-1999-0258
 Christey> See the SCO advisory at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411
   which may further clarify the issue.
 Christey> MSKB:Q154174
   MSKB:Q154174 (CVE-1999-0015) and MSKB:Q179129 (CVE-1999-0104)
   indicate that CVE-1999-0015 was fixed in NT SP3, but
   CVE-1999-0104 was not.  Thus CD:SF-LOC suggests that the
   problems keep separate candidates because one problem appears
   in a different version than the other.
