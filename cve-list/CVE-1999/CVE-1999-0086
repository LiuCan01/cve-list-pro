 Frech> Reference: XF:ibm-routed
 Prosser> This vulnerability allows debug mode to be turned on which is
   the problem.  Should this be more specific in the description? This
   one also affects SGI OSes, ref SGI Security Advisory 19981004-PX which
   is in the SGI cluster, shouldn't these be cross-referenced as the same
   vuln affects multiple OSes.
 Christey> This appears to be subsumed by CVE-1999-0215
