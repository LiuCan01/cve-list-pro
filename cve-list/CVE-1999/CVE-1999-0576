Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Baker, Shostack, Wall
   MODIFY(2) Frech, Ozancin
   REJECT(1) Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> 1.) Too general are we ready to state what the security-critical files
   and directories are
   2.) Does Ataris, Windows CE, PalmOS, Linux have such a capability
 Ozancin> Some files and directories are clearly understood to be critical. Others are
   unclear. We need to clarify that critical is.
 Frech> XF:nt-object-audit
