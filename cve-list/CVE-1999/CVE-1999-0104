Voter Comments:
 Wall> Another reference is Microsoft Knowledge Base Q179129.
 Christey> Not sure how many separate "instances" of Teardrop there are.
   See: CVE-1999-0015, CVE-1999-0104, CVE-1999-0257, CVE-1999-0258
 Christey> See the SCO advisory at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411
   which may further clarify the issue.

   Note that the hotfix name is teardrop2, but the keywords
   included in the KB article specifically name bonk
   (CVE-1999-0258) and boink.
   Since teardrop2 was fixed in a slightly different version
   (at least in a separate patch) than Teardrop, CD:SF-LOC
   suggests keeping them separate.
 Christey> Add period to the end of the description.
