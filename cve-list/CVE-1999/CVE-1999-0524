 Meunier> If this is not merged with 1999-0523 as I commented for that
   CVE, then the description should be changed to "ICMP messages of types
   13 and 14 (timestamp request and reply) and 17 and 18 (netmask request
   and reply) are acted upon without any access control".  It's a more
   precise and correct language.  I believe that this is a valid CVE
   entry (it's a common source of vulnerabilities or exposures) even
   though I see that the inferred action was "reject".  Knowing the time
   of a host also allows attacks against random number generators that
   are seeded with the current time.  I want to push to have it accepted.
 Baker> I agree with the description changes suggested by Pascal
