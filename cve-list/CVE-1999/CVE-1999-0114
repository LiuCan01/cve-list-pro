 CHANGE> [Wall changed vote from NOOP to ACCEPT]
 Landfield> with Frech modifications
 Baker> ADD REF http://www.cert.org/ftp/cert_bulletins/VB-95:10a.elm	Official Advisory
 Christey> The correct URL is http://www.cert.org/vendor_bulletins/VB-95:10a.elm
   Need to make sure that this CERT advisory describes the right
   problem, especially since the CERT advisory is dated December
   18, 1995 and the original Bugtraq post was December 26, 1995.

   BID:1802 doesn't include the 1999 posting - does Security
   Focus think that the 1999 post describes a different
   vulnerability?
 Christey> XF:elm-filter2 isn't on the X-Force web site.  How about XF:elm-filter(402) ?
   Its references point to the December 26, 1995 BUgtraq post.
   
   Also consider CIAC:G-36 and CERT:VB-95:10
 Frech> DELREF:XF:elm-filter2(711)
