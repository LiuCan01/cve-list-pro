Voter Comments:
 Stracener> Many sites are vulnerable to this problem. I recommend removing the
   explicit references to Hotmail and making the description more generic.
   Suggest: Javascript can be injected using the STYLE tag in an HTML
   formatted e-mail, allowing remote attackers to execute commands on user
   accounts.
