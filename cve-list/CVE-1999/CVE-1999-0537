 LeBlanc> Not a vulnerability. These are just checks for configuration
   settings that a user might have changed. I understand need to increase
   number of checks in a scanning product, but don't feel like these belong
   in CVE. Scanner vendors could argue that these entries are needed to
   keep a common language.
 Baker> Not sure about whether we should bother to include this type issue or not.  It does provide a stepping stone for further actions, but in and of itself it isn't a specific vulnerability.
