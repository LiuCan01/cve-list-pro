Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(1) Northcutt
   NOOP(2) Baker, Christey
   RECAST(2) Dik, Shostack

Voter Comments:
 Shostack> are there secure modes?
 Dik> Several:
   1) there is no "rpc.admind" daemon.
   there used to be a "admind" RPC daemon (100087/10)
   and there's now an "sadmind" daemon (100232/10)
   The switch over was somewhere around Solaris 2.4.
   2) Neither defaults to "secure mode"
   3) secure mode is "using secure RPC" which does
   proper over the wire authentication by specifying
   the "-S 2" option in inetd.conf
   (security level 2)
