Voter Comments:
 Christey> Is this the same as CVE-1999-0373?  They both have the same
   X-Force reference.
   
   BID:342 suggests that there are two.
   
   http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990215a suggests
   that there are two.  However, CVE-1999-0373 is written up in
   a fashion that is too general; and both XF:linux-super-bo and
   XF:linux-super-logging-bo refer to CVE-1999-0373.
   CVE-1999-0373 may need to be split.
   
 Frech> From what I can surmise, ISS released the original advisory (attached to
   linux-super-bo), and Sekure SDI expanded on it by releasing another related
   overflow in syslog (which is linux-super-logging-bo).
   
   When I was originally assigning these issues, I placed both XF references
   and the ISS advisory on the -0373 candidate, since there was nothing else
   available. Based on the information above, I'd request that
   XF:linux-super-logging-bo be removed from CVE-1999-0373.
 Christey> Given Andre's feedback, these are different issues.
   CVE-1999-0373 does not need to be split because the ISS
   reference is sufficient to distinguish that CVE from this
   candidate; however, the CVE-1999-0373 description should
   probably be modified slightly.
 Bishop> (as indicated by Christey)
 CHANGE> [Cole changed vote from NOOP to ACCEPT]
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> There are 2 bugs, as confirmed by the super author at:
   BUGTRAQ:19990226 Buffer Overflow in Super (new)
   http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/12713
   BID:397 also seems to cover this one, and it may cover
   CVE-1999-0373 as well.
