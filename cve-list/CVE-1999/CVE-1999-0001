Voter Comments:
 Christey> A Bugtraq posting indicates that the bug has to do with
   "short packets with certain options set," so the description
   should be modified accordingly.
   
   But is this the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related
   to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in
   BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release
   The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.
   The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, 
   CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.
   The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.
   So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though
   CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux
   and other OSes besides FreeBSD.
 Frech> XF:teardrop(338)
   This assignment was based solely on references to the CERT advisory.
 Christey> The description for BID:190, which links to CVE-1999-0052 (a
   FreeBSD advisory), notes that the patches provided by FreeBSD in
   CERT:CA-1998-13 suggest a connection between CVE-1999-0001 and
   CVE-1999-0052.  CERT:CA-1998-13 is too vague to be sure without
   further analysis.
