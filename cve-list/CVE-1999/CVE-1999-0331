 Shostack> this is a high cardinality item
 Prosser> needs to be more specific.
 Frech> Replace reference with XF:iemk-bug (msie-bo is obsolete and a vague
   duplicate)
   Description (from xfdb): Some versions of Internet Explorer for Windows
   contain a vulnerability that may crash the broswer when a malicious web site
   contains a certain kind of URL (that begins with "mk://") with more
   characters than the browser supports. 
 Christey> The description is too vague.
 LeBlanc> too vague
 Christey> Add period to the end of the description.
