 Christey> HP:HPSBUX9610-039 alludes to multiple vulnerabilities in
   Remote Watch (the advisory uses two words, not one, for the
   "Remote Watch" name)
   
   ADDREF BUGTRAQ:19961015 HP/UX Remote Watch (was Re: BoS: SOD remote exploit)

 Prosser> agree that the advisory mentions two vulnerabilities in Remote
   Watch, one being a socket connection and other with the showdisk utility
   which seems to be a suid vulnerability.  Never get much details on this
   anywhere since the recommendation is to remove the program since it is
   obsolete and superceded by later tools. Believe the biggest concern here is
   to just not run the tool at all.
