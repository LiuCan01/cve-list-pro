Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:xlock-bo (also add)
   As per xlock-bo, also appears on AIX, BSDI, DG/UX, FreeBSD, Solaris, and
   several Linii.
   Also, don't you mean to cite SGI:19970502-02-PX? The one you list is
   login/scheme.
 Levy> Notice that this xlock overflow is the same as in
   CA-97.13. CA-97.21 simply is a reminder.
 Christey> As pointed out by Elias, CA-97.21 states: "For more
   information about vulnerabilities in xlock... see CA-97.13"
   CA-97.13 = CVE-1999-0038.
   This may also be a duplicate with CVE-1999-0306.
