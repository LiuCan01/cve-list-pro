Reference: SUNBUG:4024179

Power management (Powermanagement) on Solaris 2.4 through 2.6 does not
start the xlock process until after the sys-suspend has completed,
which allows an attacker with physical access to input characters to
the last active application from the keyboard for a short period after
the system is restoring, which could lead to increased privileges.
