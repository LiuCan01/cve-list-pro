inadvertently used by a different user.

 Cole> Whether cookies are a vulnerbality is a debate for another time, the
   question here is whether the
   expiration feature is a vulnerability and I do not think it is
   because the underlying concerns for this
   are present even without this feature.  The expiration feature does
   not add any new vulenrabilities
   that are not already present with cookies.
