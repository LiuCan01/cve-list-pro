Reference: BUGTRAQ:19980318 AIX 4.1.5 DoS attack (aka "Port 1025 problem")
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=89025820612530&w=2

inetd in AIX 4.1.5 dynamically assigns a port N when starting
ttdbserver (ToolTalk server), but also inadvertently listens on port
N-1 without passing control to ttdbserver, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of
connections to port N-1, which are not properly closed by inetd.
