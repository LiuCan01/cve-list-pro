 LeBlanc> Share info can be obtained via SNMP queries, but I question
   whether this is a vulnerability. The system can be configured not to do
   this, and one may argue that SNMP itself is an insecure configuration.
   Furthermore, the share information isn't published via registry keys -
   the description could refer to more than one actual issue. SNMP is meant
   to allow people to obtain information about systems. I'm willing to
   discuss this with the rest of the board.
