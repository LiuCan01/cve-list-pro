Voter Comments:
 Wall> Some sources say this is not a vulnerability, but a warning.  It just
   slows down the search for the admin account (SID = 500) which can
   always be found.
 Northcutt> I change this on all NT systems I am responsible for, but is
   root a vulnerability?
 Baker> There are ways to identify the administrator account anyway, so this
   is only a minor delay to someone that is knowledgeable.  This, in and
   of itself, doesn't really strike me as a vulnerability, anymore than
   the root account on a Unix box.
 Shostack> (there is no way to hide the account name today)
 Frech> XF:nt-adminexists
