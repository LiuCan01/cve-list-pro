Voter Comments:
 Frech> It seems as if the BID-4089 assignment on this CAN name may be
   in error.
   BID-4089 (Multiple Vendor SNMP Request Handling Vulnerabilities) is
   already assigned to CVE-2002-0013. Also, this CVE issue seems to have
   nothing to do with SNMP.
 Christey> Agreed, this is the wrong BID.  SecurityFocus has assigned
   BID:643 to CVE-1999-1570, but there's a bit of an
   inconsistency.  BID:643 alludes to Bugtraq posts in 1999
   from Brock Tellier, mentioning overflows in sar via BOTH the
   -o and -f parameters.  However, they also link this issue to
   SCO advisory 99.17, although the advisory itself is too vague
   to *really* know what vulns they fixed.  And now the link
   to a potentially more detailed document (sse037.ltr)
   is broken.  So we don't have any independent reason for
   knowing whether SCO 99.17 (a) addresses any "sar"
   vulnerabilities, and (b) even if it does, whether it addresses
   *both* the -o and -f arguments originally claimed by Tellier.
   Finally, it seems rather curious that CSSA-2002-SCO.17
   talks about a -o overflow but does not mention -f.
   Sounds like an email to the security people at SCO
   is in order...
   
   OK.  Having consulted with SCO (who responded quickly), I
   looked even further into this issue.  There is now sufficient
   evidence that the -f overflow was fixed in 1999.  This
   means that a separate candidate should be created (by
   CD:SF-LOC), so the -f overflow is now covered by
   CVE-1999-1571.
   
   Need to DELREF BID:4089
