 Frech> (Accept XF reference.)
   Our references do not mention hiding activities. This issue can crash the
   SMTP server or execute arbitrary byte-code. Is there another reference
   available?
 Christey> Should this be merged with CVE-1999-0284, which is Sendmail
   with SMTP HELO?

 Baker> Apparently this XF reference is not for this issue, but for the other issue.  This should be modified to have the Bugtraq references, and remove the XF reference.
