ICMP echo (ping) is allowed from arbitrary hosts.


Current Votes:
   MODIFY(1) Meunier
   NOOP(1) Baker
   REJECT(2) Frech, Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> (Though I sympathize with this one :)
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Frech> Ping is a utility that can be run on demand; ICMP echo is a
   message 
   type. As currently worded, this candidate seems as if an arbitrary
   host 
   is vulnerable because it is capable of running an arbitrary program
   or
   function (in this case, ping/ICMP echo). There are many
   programs/functions that 
   'shouldn't' be on a computer, from a security admin's perspective.
   Even if this
   were a vulnerability, it would be impacted by CD-HIGHCARD.
 Meunier> Every ICMP message type presents a vulnerability or an
   exposure, if access is not controlled.  By that I mean not only those
   in RFC 792, but also those in RFC 1256, 950, and more.  I think that
   the description should be changed to "ICMP messages are acted upon
   without any access control".  ICMP is an error and debugging protocol.
   We complain about vendors leaving testing backdoors in their programs.
   ICMP is the equivalent for TCP/IP.  ICMP should be in the dog house,
   unless you are trying to troubleshoot something.  MTU discovery is
   just a performance tweak -- it's not necessary.  I don't know of any
   ICMP message type that is necessary if the network is functional.
   Limited logging of ICMP messages could be useful, but acting upon them
   and allowing the modification of routing tables, the behavior of the
   TCP/IP stack, etc... without any form of authentication is just crazy.
