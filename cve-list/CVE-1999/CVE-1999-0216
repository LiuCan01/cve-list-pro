Voter Comments:
 Meunier> The location of the vulnerability, whether in the Linux kernel or the
   application, is debatable.  Any program making the same (reasonnable)
   assumption is vulnerable, i.e., implements the same vulnerability:
   "Assumption that TCP-three-way handshake is complete after calling Linux
   kernel function accept(), which returns socket after getting SYN.   Result
   is process death by SIGPIPE"
   Moreover, whether it results in DOS (to third parties) depends on the
   process that made the assumption.
   I think that the present entry should be split, one entry for every
   application that implements the vulnerability (really describing threat
   instances, which is what other people think about when we talk about
   vulnerabilities), and one entry for the Linux kernel that allows the
   vulnerability to happen.
 Frech> XF:hp-inetd
   XF:linux-inetd-dos
 Baker> Since we have an hpux bulletin, the description should not specifically say Linux, should it?  It applies to mulitple OS and should be likely either modified, or in extreme case, recast
