Voter Comments:
 Christey> I confirmed this problem via visual inspection of the
   source code in http://www.lakeweb.com/scripts/filemail.zip
   Line 82 has an insufficient check for shell metacharacters
   that doesn't exclude semicolons.  Line 129 is the 
   call where the metacharacters are injected.
   
   Need to add "filemail.pl" to the description.
