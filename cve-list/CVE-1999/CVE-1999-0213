 Christey> I don't think this is the bug that everyone thinks it is.
   This candidate came from CyberCop Scanner 2.4/2.5, which
   only reports this as a DoS problem.  If SUN:00172 is an
   advisory for this, then it may be a duplicate of
   CVE-1999-0055.  There appears to be overlap with other
   references as well.  HOWEVER, this particular one deals with a
   DoS in rpcbind - which isn't mentioned in the sources for
   CVE-1999-0055.
