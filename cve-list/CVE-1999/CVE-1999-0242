Voter Comments:
 Frech> Ambiguous description: need more detail. Possibly:
   XF:linux-pop3d (mktemp() leads to reading e-mail)
 Christey> At first glance this might look like CVE-1999-0123 or
   CVE-1999-0125, however this particular candidate arises out
   of a brief mention of the problem in a larger posting which
   discusses CVE-1999-0123 (which may be the same bug as
   CVE-1999-0125).  See the following phrase in the Bugtraq
   post: "one such example of this is in.pop3d"
   
   However, the original source of this candidate's description
   explicitly mentions shadowed passwords, though it has no
   references to help out here.
