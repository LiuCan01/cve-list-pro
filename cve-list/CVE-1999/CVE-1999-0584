A Windows NT file system is not NTFS.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Northcutt, Wall
   MODIFY(1) Frech
   NOOP(2) Baker, Christey

Voter Comments:
 Wall> NTFS partition provides the security.  This could be re-worded
   to "A Windows NT file system is FAT" since it is either NTFS or FAT
   and FAT is less secure.
