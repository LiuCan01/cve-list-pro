Voter Comments:
 Frech> Unable to provide a match due to vague/insufficient description/references.
   Possible matches are:
   XF:ftp-ncsa (probably not, considering you've mentioned the webserver.)
   XF:http-ncsa-longurl (highest probability)
 Christey> CVE-1999-0235 is the one associated with XF:http-ncsa-longurl
   More research is necessary for this one.
 Baker> Since this has no references at all, and is vague and we have a
   CAN for the most likely issue, we should kill this one
