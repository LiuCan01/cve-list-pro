Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=94589559631535&w=2

Quake 1 server responds to an initial UDP game connection request with
a large amount of traffic, which allows remote attackers to use the
server as an amplifier in a "Smurf" style attack on another host, by
spoofing the connection request.
