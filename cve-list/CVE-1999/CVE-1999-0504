 Christey> This candidate is affected by the CD:CF-PASS content decision,
   which determines the appropriate level of abstraction to
   use for password problems.  CD:CF-PASS needs to be accepted
   by the Editorial Board before this candidate can be
   converted into a CVE entry; the final version of CD:CF-PASS
   may require using a different LOA than this candidate is
   currently using.
