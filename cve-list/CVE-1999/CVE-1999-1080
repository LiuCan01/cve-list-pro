rmmount in SunOS 5.7 may mount file systems without the nosuid flag
set, contrary to the documentation and its use in previous versions of
SunOS, which could allow local users with physical access to gain root
privileges by mounting a floppy or CD-ROM that contains a setuid
program and running volcheck, when the file systems do not have the
nosuid option specified in rmmount.conf.
