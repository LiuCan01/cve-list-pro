** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this
candidate is solely about a configuration that does not directly
introduce security vulnerabilities, so it is more appropriate to cover
under the Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE).  Notes: the former
description is: "The SNMP service is running."


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Baker, Prosser, Wall
   NOOP(1) Christey
   REJECT(1) Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Baker> Although newer versions on snmp are not as vulnerable as prior versions,
   this can still be a significant risk of exploitation, as seen in recent
   attacks on snmp services via automated worms
 Christey> XF:snmp(132) ?
 Prosser> This fits the "exposure" description although we also know there are many vulnerabilities in SNMP.  This is more of a policy/best practice issue for administrators.  If you need SNMP lock it down as tight as you can, if you don't need it, don't run it.
