Voter Comments:
 Cole> This is BID 824 and the BUGTRAQ reference is 19991125.
 Frech> XF:sco-unixware-xsco
 Christey> Confirmed by vendor, albeit vaguely:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=94581379905584&w=2
   
 Prosser> agree with Steve on vendor confirmation, however not sure the
   fix ref'd in BID 824 (SSE041) is right.  It lists fixes for libnsl and
   tcpip.so, nothing about xsco.  SSE050b
   (ftp://ftp.sco.com/SSE/security_bulletins/SB-99.26b) fixes a buffer overflow
   in xsco on OpenServer (the vendor message Steve refers to) but not the
   UnixWare vulnerability reported on Bugtraq and in BID824. Anyone more
   familar with SCO shed some light on this? Are they the same codebase so fix
   would be same?  From the SCO site it seems the UnixWare and OpenSever
   products are similar but have differences.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
