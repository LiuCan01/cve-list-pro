Voter Comments:
 Prosser> The Sun Patches in Ref roll-up fixes for an earlier BO in
   rdist lookup( )(ref CERT 96.14)as well as the BO in rdist function expstr()
   (ref CERT 97-23) and various vendor bulletins.  However both of these rdist
   BO's affect many more OSs than just Sun, i.e., BSD/OS 2.1, DEC OSF's, AIX,
   FreeBSD, SCO, SGI, etc.  Believe this falls into the SF-codebase content
   decision
 Frech> XF:rdist-bo (error msg formation)
   XF:rdist-bo2 (execute code)
   XF:rdist-bo3 (execute user-created code)
   XF:rdist-sept97 (root from local)
 Christey> Duplicate of CVE-1999-0022 (SUN:00179 is referenced in
   CERT:CA-97.23.rdist), but as Mike and Andre noted, there
   are multiple flaws here, so a RECAST may be necessary.
 Dik> As currently phrasedm thissa duplicate of CVE-1999-0022
 Baker> Based on our new philosophy, this should be recast/merged or re-described.
