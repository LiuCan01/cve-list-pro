DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this
candidate is solely about a configuration that does not directly
introduce security vulnerabilities, so it is more appropriate to cover
under the Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE).  Notes: the former
description is: "A component service related to NETBIOS is running."

Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> There is insufficient description to even know what this is.
   Lots of component services related to NetBIOS run, and usually do not
   constitute a problem.
