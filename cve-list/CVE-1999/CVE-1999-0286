 Wall> In some NT web servers, appending a dot at the end of a URL may
   allows attackers to read source code for active pages.
   Source:  MS Knowledge Base Article Q163485 - "Active Server Pages Script Appears
   in Browser"
 Frech> In the meantime, reword description as 'Windows NT' (trademark issue)
 Christey> Q163485 does not refer to a space, it refers to a dot.
   However, I don't have other references.
   
   Reading source code with a dot appended is in CVE-1999-0154,
   which will be proposed.  A subsequent bug similar to the
   dot bug is CVE-1999-0253.
