A Windows NT account policy has inappropriate, security-critical
settings for lockout, e.g. lockout duration, lockout after bad logon
attempts, etc.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Ozancin, Shostack, Wall
   MODIFY(2) Baker, Frech
   REJECT(1) Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> The definition is?
 Baker> Maybe a rewording of this one too.  I think most people would agree on
   some "minimum" policies like 3-5 bad attempts lockout for an hour or
   until the administrator unlocks the account.
   Suggested rewrite -
   A Windows NT account policy does not enforce reasonable minimum
   security-critical settings for lockouts, e.g. lockout duration,
   lockout after bad logon attempts, etc.
