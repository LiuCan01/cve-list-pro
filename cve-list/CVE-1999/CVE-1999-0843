 Christey> Mike Prosser's REVIEWING vote expires July 17, 2000
 Ziese> After reviewing
   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iostelnetopt-pub.shtml 
   I can not confirm this exists unless it's restructred to
   describe a problem against IOS per se; not NAT per se.  I am
   reviewing this and it may take some time.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> Not sure if Kevin's suggested reference really describes this
   one.  However, a followup email by Jim Duncan of Cisco does
   acknowledge the problem as discussed in the Bugtraq post:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=vuln-dev&m=94385601831585&w=2
   The original post is:

   It could be that the researcher believed that the problem was
   NAT, but in fact it wasn't.
   
   I need to follow up with Ziese/Balinsky on this one.
