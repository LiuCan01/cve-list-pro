 Frech> "Windows NT-based mail servers" (A trademark thing, and for clarification)

   XF:lotus-notes-helo-crash

 Levy> - Need one per software. Each one should be its own
   vulnerability.
 Ozancin> => Windows NT is correct
 Christey> These are probably multiple codebases, so we'll need to use
   dot notation.  Also need to see if this should be merged
   with CVE-1999-0098 (Sendmail SMTP HELO).
