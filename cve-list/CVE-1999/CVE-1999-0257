 Christey> Not sure how many separate "instances" of Teardrop
   and its ilk.  Also see comments on CVE-1999-0001.
   
   See: CVE-1999-0015, CVE-1999-0104, CVE-1999-0257, CVE-1999-0258
   
   Is CVE-1999-0001 the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related
   to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in
   BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release
   The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.
   The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, 
   CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.
   The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.
   So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though
   CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux
   and other OSes besides FreeBSD.
   
   Also see BUGTRAQ:19990909 CISCO and nestea.
   
   Finally, note that there is no fundamental difference between
   nestea and nestea2/nestea-v2; they are different ports that
   exploit the same problem.
   
   The original nestea advisory is at
   http://www.technotronic.com/rhino9/advisories/06.htm
   but notice that the suggested fix is in line 375 of
   ip_fragment.c, not ip_input.c.
 Christey> See the SCO advisory at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411
   which may further clarify the issue.
