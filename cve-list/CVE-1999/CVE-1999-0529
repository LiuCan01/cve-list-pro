Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> I have seen ISPs "assign" private addresses within their domain
 Meunier> A border router or firewall forwards packets that claim to come from IANA
   reserved or private addresses, e.g. 10.x.x.x, 127.x.x.x, 217.x.x.x,
   etc, outside of their area of validity.
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]
 Baker> I think the description should be modified to say they accept this type of traffic from an interface not residing on private/reserved network.
