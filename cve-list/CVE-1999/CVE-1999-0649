DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this
candidate is solely about a configuration that does not directly
introduce security vulnerabilities, so it is more appropriate to cover
under the Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE).  Notes: the former
description is: "The FSP service is running."
