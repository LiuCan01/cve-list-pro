Voter Comments:
 Prosser> same as CVE-1999-0307, only ref I can find is an old SOD
   exploit on www.outpost9.com
 Christey> MERGE CVE-1999-0307 (the exact exploit works with both
   cstm and mstm, which are clearly part of the same package,
   so CD:SF-EXEC says to merge them.)
   
   Also, there does not seem to be any recognition of this problem
   by HP.  The only other information besides the Bugtraq post
   is the SOD exploit.
