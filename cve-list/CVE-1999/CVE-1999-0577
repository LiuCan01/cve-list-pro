Phase: Proposed (19990721)
Category: CF

A Windows NT system's file audit policy does not log an event success
or failure for non-critical files or directories.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Shostack, Wall
   MODIFY(3) Baker, Frech, Ozancin
   REJECT(1) Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Ozancin> It is far less interesting what a user does successfully that what they
   attempt and fail at.
   Perhaps only failure should be logged.
 Frech> XF:nt-object-audit
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]
 Baker> Failure on non-critical files is what should be monitored.
