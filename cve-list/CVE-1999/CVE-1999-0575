A Windows NT system's user audit policy does not log an event success

User Rights, User and Group Management, Security Policy Changes,
Restart, Shutdown, and System, and Process Tracking.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(4) Christey, Ozancin, Shostack, Wall
   MODIFY(1) Frech
   RECAST(2) Baker, Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> It isn't a great truth that you should enable all or the above, if you
   do you potentially introduce a vulnerbility of filling up the file
   system with stuff you will never look at.
 Ozancin> It is far less interesting what a user does successfully that what they
   attempt and fail at.
 Christey> The list of event types is very useful for lookup.
 Frech> XF:nt-system-audit
   XF:nt-logon-audit
   XF:nt-object-audit
   XF:nt-privil-audit
   XF:nt-process-audit

   XF:nt-account-audit
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to RECAST]
