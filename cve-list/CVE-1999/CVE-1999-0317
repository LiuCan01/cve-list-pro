Voter Comments:
 Christey> DUPE CVE-1999-0845?
   Also, ADDREF XF:unixware-su-username-bo
   A report summary by Aleph One states that nobody was able to
   confirm this problem on any Linux distribution.
 Baker> If this is the same as the unixware, the n it is a dupe of 1999-0845.  There is about a two and half month difference in the bugtraq reporting of these.
   Sounds like the same bug however...
 Christey> XF:su-bo no longer seems to exist.
   How about XF:linux-subo(734) ?

   BID:475 also seems to describe the same problem
   (http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/475) in which case,
   vsyslog is blamed in:
   BUGTRAQ:19971220 Linux vsyslog() overflow
