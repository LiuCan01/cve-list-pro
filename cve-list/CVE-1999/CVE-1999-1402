Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/7172.php

The access permissions for a UNIX domain socket are ignored in Solaris
2.x and SunOS 4.x, and other BSD-based operating systems before 4.4,
which could allow local users to connect to the socket and possibly
disrupt or control the operations of the program using that socket.
