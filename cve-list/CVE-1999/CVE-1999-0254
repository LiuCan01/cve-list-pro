Voter Comments:
 Christey> What is the proper level of abstraction to use here?  Should
   we have a separate entry for each different default community
   string?  See:
   http://cve.mitre.org/Board_Sponsors/archives/msg00242.html and
   http://cve.mitre.org/Board_Sponsors/archives/msg00250.html

   Until the associated content decisions have been approved
   by the Editorial Board, this candidate cannot be accepted
   for inclusion in CVE.
