IIS 3.x and 4.x does not distinguish between pages requiring
encryption and those that do not, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via SSL requests to
the HTTPS port for normally unencrypted files, which will cause IIS
to perform extra work to send the files over SSL.
