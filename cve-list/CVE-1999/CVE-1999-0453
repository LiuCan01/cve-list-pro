   ADDREF BUGTRAQ:19990118 Remote Cisco Identification
   In description, probably better to use "Cisco" as product/company name.
 Balinsky> CiscoSecure IDS has a signature for this...ID 3602 Cisco IOS Identity.
 Christey> There may be a slight abstraction problem here, e.g. look
   at the candidate for queso/nmap; also see followup Bugtraq post
   from "Basement Research" on 19990120 which says that there are
   many other features in Cisco products that allow remote
   identification.
 Christey> fix typo: "Dicsovery"
