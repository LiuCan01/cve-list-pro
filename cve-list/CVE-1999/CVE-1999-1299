Reference: BUGTRAQ:19970203 Linux rcp bug
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=87602167420509&w=2

rcp on various Linux systems including Red Hat 4.0 allows a "nobody"
user or other user with UID of 65535 to overwrite arbitrary files,
since 65535 is interpreted as -1 by chown and other system calls,
which causes the calls to fail to modify the ownership of the file.
