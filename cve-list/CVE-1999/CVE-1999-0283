 Christey> Add version number (1.1 beta) and details of attack (appending
   a . or a )
   
   The Sun URL referenced by Dave Baker no longer exists, so I
   wasn't able to verify that it addressed the problem described
   in the Bugtraq post.  This might not even be Sun's
   "Java Web Server," as CVE-2001-0186 describes some product
   called "Free Java Web Server"
 Dik> There appears to be some confusion.
   
   The particular bug seems to be on in JWS 1.1beta or 1.1 which was fixed
   in 1.1.2 (get foo.jthml source by appending "." of "" to URL)
   
   There are other bugs that give access and that require a configuration
   change.

   as documented in:
