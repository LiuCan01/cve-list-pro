Netscape Communicator 4.04 through 4.7 (and possibly other versions)
in various UNIX operating systems converts the 0x8b character to a "<"
sign, and the 0x9b character to a ">" sign, which could allow remote
attackers to attack other clients via cross-site scripting (CSS) in
CGI programs that do not filter these characters.
