Voter Comments:
 Shostack> I follow cisco announcements and problems pretty closely, and haven't
   seen this.  Source?
 Frech> XF:cisco-web-crash
 Christey> XF:cisco-web-crash has no additional references.  I can't find
   any references in Bugtraq or Cisco either.  This bug is
   supposedly tested by at least one security product, but that
   product's database doesn't have any references either.  So
   a question becomes, how did it make it into at least two
   security companies' databases?
 Levy> BUGTGRAQ: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/60159
   BID 1154
 Ziese> The vulnerability is addressed by a vendor acknowledgement.  This one, if
   recast to reflect that "...after using a long url..." should be replaced
   with
   "...A defect in multiple releases of Cisco IOS software will cause a Cisco
   router or switch to halt and reload if the IOS HTTP service is enabled,
   browsing to "http://router-ip/anytext?/" is attempted, and the enable
   password is supplied when requested. This defect can be exploited to produce
   a denial of service (DoS) attack."
   Then I can accept this and mark it as "Verfied by my Company".  If it can't
   be recast because this (long uri) is diffferent then our release (special
   url construction).
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Christey> Elias Levy's suggested reference is CVE-2000-0380.
   I don't think that Kevin's description is really addressing
   this either.  The lack of references and a specific
   description make this candidate unusable, so it should be
   rejected.
