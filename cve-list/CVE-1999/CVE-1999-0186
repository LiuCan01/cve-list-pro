Voter Comments:
 Frech> Change XF:snmp-backdoor-access to XF:sol-hidden-commstr
   Add ISS:Hidden Community String in SNMP Implementation
 Christey> What is the proper level of abstraction to use here?  Should
   we have a separate entry for each different default community
   string?  See:
   http://cve.mitre.org/Board_Sponsors/archives/msg00242.html and
