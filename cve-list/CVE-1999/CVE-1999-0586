Current Votes:
   NOOP(1) Baker
   RECAST(1) Shostack
   REJECT(1) Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Shostack> Might be acceptable if clearer; is that a standard service on a
   non-standard port, or any service on an unassigned port?
 Baker> It might actually be an enhancement rather than a problem to run a service on a non-standard port
