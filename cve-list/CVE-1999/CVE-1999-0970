   The August 16, 2000 news item says "This release fixes some
   security problems."  It's for version 2.07, but the discloser
   didn't say what version was available.
   
   Other security fixes are in the release notes at
   http://www.omnicron.ab.ca/httpd/docs/release.html Notes for
   Professional Version 1.01 say "Patched up two security weaknesses."
   Notes for version 2.07 say "Fixes dot-appending vulnerability."
   Professional Alpha 7 says "Revamped CGI launching and security,"
   Professional Alpha 4 says "Fixed SSI path mapping and security
   problems," Alpha 5 says "Security fixup."
   
   In other words, you can't tell whether they've fixed this bug
   or not.
