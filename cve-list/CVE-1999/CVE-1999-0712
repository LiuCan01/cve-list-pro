Voter Comments:
 Blake> This obscurely-written advisory seems to state that COAS will make the
   file world-readable, not that it allows the user to make it so.  I hardly
   think that allowing the user to turn off security is a vulnerability.
 Christey> It's difficult to write the description based on what's in
   the advisory.  If COAS inadvertently changes permissions
   without user confirmation, then it should be ACCEPTed with
   appropriate modification to the description.
 Christey> ADDREF BID:137
 CHANGE> [Armstrong changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
