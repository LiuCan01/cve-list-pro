Voter Comments:
 Christey> CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In
   NTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers
   Mnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar
   problem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as
   CVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the "previous report" as
   CVE-1999-0287, which can be found at:
   http://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html
   
   0287 describes an exploit via the "template" hidden variable.
   The exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to
   change the filename to read from the template variable.
   
   The exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable
   directly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also
   encoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to
   the web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287
   and 0467 are the same.
 Christey> 
   The CD:SF-EXEC content decision also applies here.  We have 2
   programs, wguest.exe and rguest.exe, which appear to have the
   same problem.  CD:SF-EXEC needs to be accepted by the Editorial
   Board before this candidate can be converted into a CVE
   entry.  When finalized, CD:SF-EXEC will decide whether
   this candidate should be split or not.
