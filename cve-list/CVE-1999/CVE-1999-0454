Name: CVE-1999-0454
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-1999-0454
Phase: Proposed (19990728)
Category: SF

A remote attacker can sometimes identify the operating system of a
host based on how it reacts to some IP or ICMP packets, using a tool
such as nmap or queso.


Current Votes:
   MODIFY(1) Frech
   NOOP(2) Christey, Wall
   REJECT(2) Baker, Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> Nmap and queso are the tip of the iceberg and not the most advanced
   ways to accomplish this.  To pursue making the world signature free
   is as much a vulnerability as having signatures, nay more.
 Frech> XF:decod-nmap(2053)
   XF:decod-queso(2048)
 Christey> Add "fingerprinting" to facilitate search.

 Baker> I think we can probably reject this as the corollary is that you can identify OS from a IP/TCP packet sent by a system, looking at various parts of the SYN packet.  Unless we believe that all systems should always use identical packet header/identical responses, in which case the protocol should not permit variation.
