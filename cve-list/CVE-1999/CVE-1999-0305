The system configuration control (sysctl) facility in BSD based
operating systems OpenBSD 2.2 and earlier, and FreeBSD 2.2.5 and
earlier, does not properly restrict source routed packets even when
the (1) dosourceroute or (2) forwarding variables are set, which
allows remote attackers to spoof TCP connections.
