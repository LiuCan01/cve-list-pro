   Possible dupe with CVE-1999-0162.
 Christey> This is not a dupe with CVE-1999-0162.  The Cisco advisory
   referenced in CVE-1999-0162 says that affected Cisco versions
   are 10.0 through 10.3.  This CAN deals with versions 8.2
   through 9.1.  In addition, the date of release of
   CVE-1999-0162 is June 1995; this CAN was released December
   1992.  Both items include clear Cisco acknowledgement with
   details, so we should conclude that  they are separate
   problems, despite the vagueness of the reports.
