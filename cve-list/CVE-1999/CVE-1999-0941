Voter Comments:
 Frech> References are vague, but seem to be identical to CVE-1999-0940
   (XF:mutt-text-enriched-mime-bo). According to the references, the malformed
   messages consist of metacharacters. In addition, -0941's reference and
   -0940's SuSE reference both refer to fixes in 1.0pre3 release. Will
   reconsider vote if other clearer references are forthcoming.
 Christey> Modify to mention that the metachar's are in the Content-Type header.
