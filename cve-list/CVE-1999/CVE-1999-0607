 Christey> http://www.quikstore.com/help/pages/Security/security.htm says:
   
   "It is IMPORTANT that during the setup of the QuikStore program, you
   check to make sure that the cgi-bin or executable program directory
   of your web site not be viewable from the outside world. You don't
   want the users to have access to your programs or log files that could
   be stored there!
   
   ...
   
   If you can view or download these files from the browser, someone
   else can too"
   
   So is this a configuration problem?  See the configuration file at
   http://www.quikstore.com/help/pages/Configuration/configparametersfull.htm
   The [DIRECTORY_PATHS] section identifies pathnames and describes how
   pathnames are constructed.  It clearly uses relative pathnames,
   so all data is underneath the base directory!!
   
   If we call this a configuration problem, then maybe this (and
   all other "CGI-data-in-web-tree" configuration problems) should
   be combined.
 Christey> Consider adding BID:1983
