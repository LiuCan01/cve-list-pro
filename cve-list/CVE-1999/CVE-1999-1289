ICQ 98 beta on Windows NT leaks the internal IP address of a client in
the TCP data segment of an ICQ packet instead of the public address
(e.g. through NAT), which provides remote attackers with potentially
sensitive information about the client or the internal network
configuration.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Cole, Frech, Wall
   NOOP(1) Foat

Voter Comments:
 Frech> Override EX-BETA in this case, since ICQ is always in beta
   and is 
   widely run in production environments.
