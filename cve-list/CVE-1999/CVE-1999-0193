Voter Comments:
 Frech> possibly XF:ascend-kill
   I can't find a reference that lists both routers in the same reference.
 Wall> Comment:  There is a reference about the zero length TCP option in BugTraq on
   Feb 5, 1999
   and it mentions Cisco, but not directly Ascend or 3Com.  CIAC Advisory I-038
   mentions
   vulnerabilities in Ascend, but does not mention TCP.  CIAC Advisory I-052
   mentions
   3Com vulnerabilities, but not TCP.  Too confusing withour better references.
 Landfield> What are the references for this ? I cannot find a means to check it out.
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
 Frech> Cannot reconcile to our database without further references.
 Blake> I'm with Andre.  I only remember and can find reference to the Ascend
   issue.  Do we have a refernce to the 3Coms?  If not, that should be
   removed from the description.
