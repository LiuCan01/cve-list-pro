Voter Comments:
 Christey> This candidate is unconfirmed by the vendor.
   
   Posted by Arne Vidstrom.
 Blake> I'd like to change my vote on this from ACCEPT to NOOP.  I did some
   digging and the vendor seems to have discontinued the product, so no
   information is available beyond Arne's post.  Unless Andre has a copy
   in his archive and can test it, I think we have to leave it out.
 Wall> I agree with Blake.  We have not seen the product and it has been discontinued.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> If this is (or was) tested by some tool, we should ACCEPT it.
