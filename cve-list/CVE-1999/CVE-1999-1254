Windows 95, 98, and NT 4.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service by spoofing ICMP redirect messages from a router, which causes
Windows to change its routing tables.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> Need to get feedback from MS on this.
 Christey> (prompted from Pascal Meunier) should this be treated
   as a general design issue with ICMP?  Or is it a specific
   implementation flaw that only affects Reliant?
 Meunier> The description is too narrow and incorrect.  Spoofed ICMP
   redirect messages can be used to setup man-in-the-middle attacks
   instead of a DoS.  There's no reason that this behavior would be
   limited to Windows, as it is specified by the standard.  As I said
   elsewhere, ICMP messages should not be acted upon without access
   controls.
