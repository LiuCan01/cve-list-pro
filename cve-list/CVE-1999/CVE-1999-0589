Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(1) Wall
   NOOP(1) Baker
   RECAST(2) Christey, Northcutt

Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> I think we can define appropriate, take a look at the nt security .pdf
   and see if you can't see a way to phrase specific keys in a way that
   defines inappropriate.
 Christey> Upon further reflection, this is too high-level for CVE.
   Specific registry keys with bad permissions is roughly
   equivalent to Unix configuration files that have bad
   permissions; those permission problems can be created by
   any vendor, not just a specific one.  Therefore this
   candidate should be RECAST into each separate registry
   key that has this problem.
