Reference: XF:wuftpd-abor-gain-privileges(7169)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/7169

(abort file transfer) command is executed during a file transfer,
which causes a signal to be handled incorrectly and allows local and
possibly remote attackers to read arbitrary files.
