Voter Comments:
 Christey> This has no sources; neither does the original database that
   this entry came from.  It's a likely duplicate of 
   CVE-1999-0813.
 Frech> I disagree on the dupe; see Linux-Security Mailing List,
   "[linux-security] Cfinger (Yet more :)" at
   http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/92/1996/9/0/2217716/. Seems as
   if v1.2.3 is vulnerable, perhaps 1.3.0 also. CVE-1999-0813 pertains
   to 1.4.x and below and shows up two years later.
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Frech> If the reference I previously supplied is correct, then
   it appears as if the poster modified the source using authorized 
   access to make it vulnerable. Modifying the source in this manner 
   does not qualify as being listed a vulnerability.
