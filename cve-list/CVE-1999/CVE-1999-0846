 Christey> CVE-1999-0844 is confirmed by MDaemon at
   http://mdaemon.deerfield.com/helpdesk/hotfix.cfm but there
   is no apparent confirmation for this problem, even
   though it was posted the same day.
 Prosser> Looks like from a follow-on message on Bugtraq from Nobuo
   <http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=1999-11-28&msg=199912011604.HJI39569.BX-NOJ@lac.co.jp> Deerfield sent a reply about the
   DoS problems in MDaemon 2.8.5, that also talks about fixing the 2.7 J DoS
   that Nobuo initially reported. Can't find the original message, so may have
   been limited distro. Looks like an upgrade to the latest release might be
   the final solution here.
