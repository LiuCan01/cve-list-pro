Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> Here we are crossing into the best practices arena again.  However since
   passfilt does establish a measurable standard and since we aren't the
   ones defining the stanard, simply saying it should be employed I will
   vote for this.  
 Frech> XF:nt-passfilt-not-inst(1308)
   XF:nt-passfilt-not-found(1309)
 Christey> Consider MSKB:Q161990 and MSKB:Q151082
