Voter Comments:
 Christey> Abstraction and definition issue: CD:SF-LOC suggests combining
   issues of the same type.  Some people refer to "directory
   traversal" and just mean .. problems; but there are other
   issues (specifying an absolute pathname, using C: drive
   letters, doing encodings) that, to my way of thinking, are
   "different."  Perhaps this should be split.
   
   My brain hurts too much right now.  There are a couple
   problems with the references and descriptions of CVE-1999-1050
   and CVE-1999-1051.  I'm interpreting the underlying nature
   of the problem(s) a little differently than others are.
   Some of it may be due to differing definitions or thoughts
   about what "directory traversal vulnerabilities" are.
