   SCO appears to have acknowledged this as well:
   ftp://ftp.sco.com/SSE/security_bulletins/SB-99.01a
   
   The poster also claims that OpenBSD fixed this as well.
 Frech> XF:bootp-remote-bo
 Christey> Further analysis indicates that this is a duplicate of CVE-1999-0799
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REJECT to NOOP]
 Christey> What was I thinking?  Brian Caswell pointed out that this is
   *not* the same bug as CVE-1999-0799.  As reported in the
   1998 Bugtraq post, the bug is in bootpd.c, and is related
   to providing an htype value that is used as an index
   into an array, and exceeds the intended boundaries of that
   array.
