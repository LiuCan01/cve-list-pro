Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Frech, Northcutt
   MODIFY(1) Baker
   REJECT(1) Shostack

Voter Comments:
 Shostack> this is not a vulnerability but a design feature.
 Baker> Maybe we should reword it so that it is clear that this was a problem to something like:
   
   "A remote attacker could read/write files to the system with root-level permissions on NFS servers that fail to properly check the UID."
