Voter Comments:
 Shostack> WFTP is not sufficient; is this wu-, ws-, war-, or another?
 Frech> Other have mentioned this before, but it may be WU-FTP.
   POSSIBLY XF:ftp-exec; does this have to do with the Site Exec allowing root
   access without anon FTP or a regular account?
   POSSIBLY XF:wu-ftpd-exec;same as above conditions, but instead from a
   non-anon FTP account and gain root privs.
 Christey> added MSKB reference
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REVOTE to REJECT]
 Christey> The MSKB article may have confused things even more.  There
   were reports of problems in a Windows-based FTP server called
   WFTP (http://www.wftpd.com/) that is not a Microsft FTP
   server.  It's best to just kill this candidate where it
   stands and start fresh.
