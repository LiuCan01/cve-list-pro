 Shostack> isn't that what finger is supposed to do?

   Here's the nature of the problem.
   (1) FFingerd allows users to decide not to be fingered,
   printing a message "That user does not want to be fingered"
   (2) If the fingered user does not exist, then FFingerd's
   intended default is to print that the user does not
   want to be fingered; however, the error message has a
   period at the end.
   Thus, ffingerd can allow someone to determine who valid users
   on the server are, *in spite of* the intended functionality of
   ffingerd itself.  Thus this exposure should be viewed in light
   of the intended functionality of the application, as opposed
   to the common usage of the finger protocol in general.
   
   Also, the vendor posted a followup and said that a patch was
   available.  See:
