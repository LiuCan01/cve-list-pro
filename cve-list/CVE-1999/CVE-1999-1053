Reference: BUGTRAQ:19991105 Guestbook.pl, sloppy SSI handling in Apache? (VD#2)

Reference: BID:776
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/776

guestbook.pl cleanses user-inserted SSI commands by removing text
between "<!--" and "-->" separators, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands when guestbook.pl is run on Apache 1.3.9
and possibly other versions, since Apache allows other closing
sequences besides "-->".
