   Candidate implicitly may refer to relaying settings enabled by default, or
   the bypass/circumvention of relaying. Both interpretations were used in
   assigning this candidate.
 Christey> The intention of this candidate is to cover configurations in
   which the admin has explicitly enabled relaying.  Other cases
   in which the application *intends* to prvent relaying, but
   there is some specific input that bypasses/tricks it, count
   as vulnerabilities (or exposures?) and as such would be
   assigned different numbers.
   
   http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/spam.html seems like a good
   general resource, as does ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2505.txt
 Christey> I changed the description to make it more clear that the issue
   is that of explicit configuration, as opposed to being the
   result of a vulnerability.
