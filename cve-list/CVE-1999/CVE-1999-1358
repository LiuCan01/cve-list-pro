Status: Entry
Reference: MSKB:Q157673
Reference: URL:http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q157/6/73.asp
Reference: XF:nt-user-policy-update(7400)
Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/7400.php

When an administrator in Windows NT or Windows 2000 changes a user
policy, the policy is not properly updated if the local ntconfig.pol
is not writable by the user, which could allow local users to bypass
restrictions that would otherwise be enforced by the policy, possibly
by changing the policy file to be read-only.
