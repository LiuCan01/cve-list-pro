Win32 ICQ 98a 1.30, and possibly other versions, does not display the
entire portion of long filenames, which could allow attackers to send
an executable file with a long name that contains so many spaces that
the .exe extension is not displayed, which could make the user believe
that the file is safe to open from the client.
