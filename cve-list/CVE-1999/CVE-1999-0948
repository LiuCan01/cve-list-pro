Voter Comments:
 Christey> CVE-1999-0948 and CVE-1999-0949 are extremely similar.
   uum (0948) is exploitable through a different set of options
   than canuum (0949).  If it's the same generic option parsing
   routine used by both programs, then CD:SF-CODEBASE says to
   merge them.  But if it's not, then CD:SF-LOC and CD:SF-EXEC
   says to split them.  However, this is a prime example of
   how SF-EXEC might be modified - uum and canuum are clearly
   part of the same package, so in the absence of clear
   information, maybe we should merge them.
