Voter Comments:
 Northcutt> I think we need to enumerate the shares and or the access control
 Christey> One question is, what is "inappropriate"?  It's probably
   very dependent on the policy of the enterprise on which
   this is found.  And should writable shares be different
   from readable shares?  (Or file systems, mail spools, etc.)
   Yes, the impact may be different, but we could have a
   large number of entries for each possible type of access.
   A content decision (CD:CF-DATA) needs to be reviewed
   and accepted by the Editorial Board in order to resolve
   this question.
 LeBlanc> Unacceptably vague - agree with Christey's comments.
