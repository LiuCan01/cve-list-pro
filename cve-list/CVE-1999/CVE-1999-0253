Voter Comments:
 Christey> This is a problem that was introduced after patching a
   previous dot bug with the iis-fix hotfix (see CVE-1999-0154).
   Since the hotfix introduced the problem, this should be
   treated as a seaprate issue.
 Wall> Agree with the comment.
 LeBlanc> - this one is so old, I don't remember it at all and can't verify or
   deny the issue. If you can find some documentation that says we fixed it (KB
   article, hotfix, something), then I would change this to ACCEPT
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
