Voter Comments:
 Christey> What is the right level of abstraction to use here?  Should
   we combine all possible interpreters into a single entry,
   or have a different entry for each one?  I've often seen
   Perl separated from other interpreters - is it included
   by default in some Windows web server configurations?
 Christey> Add tcsh, zsh, bash, rksh, ksh, ash, to support search.
