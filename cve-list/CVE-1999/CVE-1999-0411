Voter Comments:
 Frech> Neither XFDB nor the BugTraq article (incidentally, shows up as 7 March, not
   19 February) does not mention gaining root access... it says a local user
   could
   "delete or overwrite arbitrary files on the system."
 Baker> By overwriting arbitrary files, one could then gain root access.  I agree with a minor description change to reflect this.
 Christey> Normalize Bugtraq reference to:
   BUGTRAQ:19990307 Little exploit for startup scripts (SCO 5.0.4p).
