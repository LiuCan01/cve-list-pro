Voter Comments:
 Wall> Denial of service in Windows NT IIS Server 1.0 using .....
   Source: Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q115052 - IIS Server.
 Frech> XF:http-dotdot (not necessarily IIS?)
 Christey> DELREF XF:http-dotdot - it deals with a read/access dot dot
   problem.
 Christey> This actually looks like XF:iis-dot-dot-crash(1638)
   http://xforce.iss.net/static/1638.php
   If so, include the version number (2.0)
   
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REVOTE to REJECT]
 Christey> Bill Wall intended to suggest Q155052, but the affected
   IIS version there is 1.0; the effect is to read files,
   so this sounds like a directory traversal problem,
   instead of an inability to process certain strings.
   
   As a result, this candidate is too general, since it could
   apply to 2 different problems, so it should be REJECTed.
 Christey> Consider adding BID:2218
