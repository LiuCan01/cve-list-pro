Voter Comments:
 Christey> CVE-1999-0948 and CVE-1999-0949 are extremely similar.
   uum (0948) is exploitable through a different set of options
   than canuum (0949).  If it's the same generic option parsing
   routine used by both programs, then CD:SF-CODEBASE says to
   merge them.  But if it's not, then CD:SF-LOC and CD:SF-EXEC
   says to split them.  However, this is a prime example of
   how SF-EXEC might be modified - uum and canuum are clearly
   part of the same package, so in the absence of clear
   information, maybe we should merge them.
   
   Also review BID:758 and BID:757 - may need to change the BID
   here.
 Frech> XF:canna-uum-bo
 Christey> CHANGEREF BID:757 BID:758
 Christey> The following page says that canuum is a "Japanese input tty
   frontend for Canna using uum," which suggests that it is, at
   the least, a different package, so perhaps this should stay SPLIT.
