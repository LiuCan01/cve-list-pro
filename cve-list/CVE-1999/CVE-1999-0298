 Dik> If you run with "-ypset", then you're always insecure.
   With ypsetme, only root on the local host
   can run ypset in Solaris 2.x+.
   Probably true for SunOS 4, hence my vote.

 Dik> This vulnerability does exist in SunOS 4.x in non default configurations.
   In Solaris 2.x, the vulnerability only applies to files named "cache_binding"
   and not all files ending in .2
   Both releases are not vulnerable in the default configuration (both
   disabllow ypset by default which prevents this problem from occurring)
