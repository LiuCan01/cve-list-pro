Internet Explorer 4 treats a 32-bit number ("dotless IP address") in
the a URL as the hostname instead of an IP address, which causes IE to
apply Local Intranet Zone settings to the resulting web page, allowing
remote malicious web servers to conduct unauthorized activities by
using URLs that contain the dotless IP address for their server.
