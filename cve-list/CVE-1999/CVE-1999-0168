Name: CVE-1999-0168
Status: Entry
Reference: XF:nfs-portmap

The portmapper may act as a proxy and redirect service requests from
an attacker, making the request appear to come from the local host,
possibly bypassing authentication that would otherwise have taken
place.  For example, NFS file systems could be mounted through the
portmapper despite export restrictions.
