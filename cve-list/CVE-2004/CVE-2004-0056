Multiple vulnerabilities in the H.323 protocol implementation for
Nortel Networks Business Communications Manager (BCM), Succession 1000
IP Trunk and IP Peer Networking, and 802.11 Wireless IP Gateway allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
arbitrary code, as demonstrated by the NISCC/OUSPG PROTOS test suite
for the H.225 protocol.
