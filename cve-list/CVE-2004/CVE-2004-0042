vsftpd 1.1.3 generates different error messages depending on whether
or not a valid username exists, which allows remote attackers to
identify valid usernames.

   REJECT(1) Cox

Voter Comments:
 Williams> insufficient data.
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Cox> Expected behaviour.  By source code analysis the difference in
   behaviour mentioned in the report only occurs when an administrator has
   configured the server with an explicit userlist - either to allow or deny
   all users in the userlist.  The vsftpd manual page states that if a
   userlist is used then the user will be denied access before they are asked
   for a password to help prevent cleartext passwords being transmitted.  
   Administrators who don't want this behaviour do not need to configure an
   optional userlist.
