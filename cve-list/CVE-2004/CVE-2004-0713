The remove method in a stateful Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) in BEA
WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 8.1 through SP2, 7.0
through SP4, and 6.1 through SP6, does not properly check EJB
permissions before unexporting a bean, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove EJB objects from remote views before the
security exception is thrown.
