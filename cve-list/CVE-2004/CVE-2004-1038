A design error in the IEEE1394 specification allows attackers with
physical access to a device to read and write to sensitive memory
using a modified FireWire/IEEE 1394 client, thus bypassing intended
restrictions that would normally require greater degrees of physical
access to exploit.  NOTE: this was reported in 2008 to affect Windows
Vista, but some Linux-based operating systems have protection
mechanisms against this attack.
