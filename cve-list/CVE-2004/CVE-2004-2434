Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (browser crash) via a link with "::{" (colon colon
left brace), which triggers a null dereference when the user attempts
to save the link using "Save As" and Internet Explorer prepares an
error message with an attacker-controlled format string.
