Multiple vulnerabilities in SYMDNS.SYS for Symantec Norton Internet
Security and Professional 2002 through 2004, Norton Personal Firewall
2002 through 2004, Norton AntiSpam 2004, Client Firewall 5.01 and
5.1.1, and Client Security 1.0 through 2.0 allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via (1) a
manipulated length byte in the first-level decoding routine for
NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) that modifies an index variable and leads
to a stack-based buffer overflow, (2) a heap-based corruption problem
in an NBNS response that is missing certain RR fields, and (3) a
stack-based buffer overflow in the DNS component via a Resource Record
(RR) with a long canonical name (CNAME) field composed of many smaller
components.
