Multiple buffer overflows in Ipswitch WS_FTP Server 4.0.2 (1) allow
remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by causing a
large error string to be generated by the ALLO handler, or (2) may
allow remote FTP administrators to execute arbitrary code by causing a
long hostname or username to be inserted into a reply to a STAT
command while a file is being transferred.
