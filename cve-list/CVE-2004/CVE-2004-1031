fcronsighup in Fcron 2.0.1, 2.9.4, and possibly earlier versions
allows local users to bypass access restrictions and load an arbitrary
configuration file by starting an suid process and pointing the
fcronsighup configuration file to a /proc entry that is owned by root
but modifiable by the user, such as /proc/self/cmdline or
/proc/self/environ.
