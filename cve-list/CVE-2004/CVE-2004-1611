SalesLogix 6.1 does not verify if a user is authenticated before
performing sensitive operations, which could allow remote attackers to
(1) execute arbitrary SLX commands on the server or spoof the server
via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, or (2) obtain the database
password via a GetConnection request to TCP port 1707.
