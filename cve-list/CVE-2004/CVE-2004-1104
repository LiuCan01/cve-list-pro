Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP2 allows remote attackers to spoof a
legitimate URL in the status bar and conduct a phishing attack via a
web page that contains a BASE element that points to the legitimate
site, followed by an anchor (a) element with an empty "href"
attribute, and a FORM whose action points to a malicious URL, and an
INPUT submit element that is modified to look like a legitimate URL.
