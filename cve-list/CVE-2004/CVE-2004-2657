** DISPUTED **

Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.1, and possibly other versions, preserves some
records of user activity even after uninstalling, which allows local
users who share a Windows profile to view the records after a new
installation of Firefox, as reported for the list of Passwords Never
Saved web sites.  NOTE: The vendor has disputed this issue, stating
that "The uninstaller is primarily there to uninstall the
application. It is not there to uninstall user data. For the moment I
will stick by my module-owner decision."
