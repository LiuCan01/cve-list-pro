** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in register.php for unknown
versions of vBulletin allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML
or web script via the reg_site (or possibly regsite) parameter.  NOTE:
the vendor has disputed this issue, saying "There is no hidden field
called 'reg_site', nor any $reg_site variable anywhere in the
vBulletin 2 or vBulletin 3 source code or templates, nor has it ever
existed.  We can only assume that this vulnerability was found in a
site running code modified from that supplied by Jelsoft."
