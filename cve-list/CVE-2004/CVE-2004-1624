Carbon Copy 6.0.5257 does not drop system privileges when opening
external programs through the help topic interface, which allows local
users to gain privileges via (1) the help topic interface in
CCW32.exe, which launches Notepad, or (2) the help button in the
Carbon Copy Scheduler (CCSched.exe).
