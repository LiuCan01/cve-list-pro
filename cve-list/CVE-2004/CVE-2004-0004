The libCheckSignature function in crypto-utils.lib for OpenCA 0.9.1.6
and earlier only compares the serial of the signer's certificate and
the one in the database, which can cause OpenCA to incorrectly accept
a signature if the certificate's chain is trusted by OpenCA's chain
directory, allowing remote attackers to spoof requests from other
users.
