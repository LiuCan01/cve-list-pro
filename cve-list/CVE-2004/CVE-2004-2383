Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 through 6.0 allows remote attackers to
bypass cross-frame scripting restrictions and capture keyboard events
from other domains via an HTML document with Javascript that is
outside a frameset that includes the target domain, then forcing the
frameset to maintain focus.  NOTE: the discloser claimed that the
vendor does not categorize this as a vulnerability, but it can be used
in a spoofing scenario; the discloser provides alternate scenarios.
Spoofing scenarios are currently included in CVE.
