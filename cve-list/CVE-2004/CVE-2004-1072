The binfmt_elf loader (binfmt_elf.c) in Linux kernel 2.4.x up to
2.4.27, and 2.6.x up to 2.6.8, may create an interpreter name string
that is not NULL terminated, which could cause strings longer than
PATH_MAX to be used, leading to buffer overflows that allow local
users to cause a denial of service (hang) and possibly execute
arbitrary code.
