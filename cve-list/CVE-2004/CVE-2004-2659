Opera offers an Open button to verify that a user wishes to execute a
downloaded file, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to
construct a race condition that tricks a user into clicking Open via a
request for a different mouse or keyboard action very shortly before
the Open dialog appears.  NOTE: this is a different issue than
CVE-2005-2407.
