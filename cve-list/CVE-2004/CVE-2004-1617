Lynx, lynx-ssl, and lynx-cur before 2.8.6dev.8 allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a web page or HTML
email that contains invalid HTML including (1) a TEXTAREA tag with a
large COLS value and (2) a large tag name in an element that is not
terminated, as demonstrated by mangleme.  NOTE: a followup suggests
that the relevant trigger for this issue is the large COLS value.
