Format string vulnerability in VMware Workstation 4.5.2 build-8848, if
running with elevated privileges, might allow local users to execute
arbitrary code via format string specifiers in command line arguments.
NOTE: it is not clear if there are any default or typical
circumstances under which VMware would be running with privileges
beyond those already available to the attackers, so this might not be
a vulnerability.
