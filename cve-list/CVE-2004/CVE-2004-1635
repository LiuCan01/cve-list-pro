Bugzilla 2.17.1 through 2.18rc2 and 2.19 from cvs, when using the
insidergroup feature, does not sufficiently protect private
attachments when there are changes to the metadata, such as filename,
description, MIME type, or review flags, which allows remote
authenticated users to obtain sensitive information when (1) viewing
the bug activity log or (2) receiving bug change notification mails.
