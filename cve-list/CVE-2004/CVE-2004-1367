Oracle 10g Database Server, when installed with a password that
contains an exclamation point ("!") for the (1) DBSNMP or (2) SYSMAN
user, generates an error that logs the password in the world-readable
postDBCreation.log file, which could allow local users to obtain that
password and use it against SYS or SYSTEM accounts, which may have
been installed with the same password.
