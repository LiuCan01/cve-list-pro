mshtml.dll in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0.2800 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a table containing a form that
crosses multiple td elements, and whose "float: left" class is defined
in a link to a CSS stylesheet after the end of the table, which may
trigger a null dereference.
