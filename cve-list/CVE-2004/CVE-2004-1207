The Serious engine, as used in (1) Alpha Black Zero Intrepid Protocol
1.04 and earlier, (2) Nitro family, and (3) Serious Sam Second
Encounter 1.07 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(server crash) via a large number of UDP join requests that exceeds
the maximum player limit, as originally reported for Alpha Black Zero.
