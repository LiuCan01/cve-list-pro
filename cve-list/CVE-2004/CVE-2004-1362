The PL/SQL module for the Oracle HTTP Server in Oracle Application
Server 10g, when using the WE8ISO8859P1 character set, does not
perform character conversions properly, which allows remote attackers
to bypass access restrictions for certain procedures via an encoded
URL with "%FF" encoded sequences that are improperly converted to "Y"
characters.
