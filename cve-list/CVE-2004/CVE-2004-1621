** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Lotus Notes R6 and
Domino R6, and possibly earlier versions, allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary web script or HTML via square brackets at the
beginning and end of (1) computed for display, (2) computed when
composed, or (3) computed text element fields.  NOTE: the vendor has
disputed this issue, saying that it is not a problem with Notes/Domino
itself, but with the applications that do not properly handle this
feature.
