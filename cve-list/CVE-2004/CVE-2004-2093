Reference: VULN-DEV:20040209 rsync <= 2.5.7 local buffer overflow (no root today:)

Buffer overflow in the open_socket_out function in socket.c for rsync
2.5.7 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long RSYNC_PROXY
environment variable.  NOTE: since rsync is not setuid, this issue
does not provide any additional privileges beyond those that are
already available to the user.  Therefore this issue may be REJECTED
in the future.
