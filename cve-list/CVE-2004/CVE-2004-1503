Integer overflow in the InitialDirContext in Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) 1.4.2, 1.5.0 and possibly other versions allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (Java exception and failed DNS requests)
via a large number of DNS requests, which causes the xid variable to
wrap around and become negative.
