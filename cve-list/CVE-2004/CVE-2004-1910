rufsi.dll in Symantec Virus Detection allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (crash) via a long string to the
GetPrivateProfileString function.  NOTE: this issue was originally
reported as a buffer overflow, but that specific claim is disputed by
the vendor, although a crash is acknowledged.
