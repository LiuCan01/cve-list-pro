Netscape 7.x to 7.2, and possibly other versions, allows remote
attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites by injecting content from one
window into a target window whose name is known but resides in a
different domain, as demonstrated using a pop-up window on a trusted
web site, aka the "window injection" vulnerability.
