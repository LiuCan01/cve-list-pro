Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/18516

The addslashes function in PHP 4.3.9 does not properly escape a NULL
(/0) character, which may allow remote attackers to read arbitrary
files in PHP applications that contain a directory traversal
vulnerability in require or include statements, but are otherwise
protected by the magic_quotes_gpc mechanism.  NOTE: this issue was
originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision
is in active dispute.  This candidate may change significantly in the
future as a result of further discussion.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> There is active disagreement regarding whether this satisfies the
   criteria for inclusion in CVE, because the attack vectors require
   function parameters that are typically controlled only by the
   application developer, not an external attacker.  This would mean that
   only the PHP application owner could exploit it.
   
   Since the application developer presumably already has acccess
   to the underlying file system, directory traversal attacks provide no
   additional access to the application owner.  Therefore, this candidate
   would only be valid if there are cases in which the attacker can
   inject a null character into a string that is processed by addslashes.
