The modified suexec program in cPanel, when configured for mod_php and
compiled for Apache 1.3.31 and earlier without mod_phpsuexec, allows
local users to execute untrusted shared scripts and gain privileges,
as demonstrated using untainted scripts such as (1) proftpdvhosts or
(2) addalink.cgi, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-0490.
