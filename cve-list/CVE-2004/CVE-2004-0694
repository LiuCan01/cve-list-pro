Buffer overflow in LHA 1.14 and earlier allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via unknown vectors related to "command line processing," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2004-0771.  NOTE: this issue may be REJECTED if
there are not any cases in which LHA is setuid or is otherwise used
across security boundaries.
