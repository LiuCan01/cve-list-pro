Buffer overflow in Bochs before 2.1.1, if installed setuid, allows
local users to execute arbitrary code via a long HOME environment
variable, which is used if the .bochsrc, bochsrc, and bochsrc.txt
cannot be found in a known path.  NOTE: some external documents
recommend that Bochs be installed setuid root, so this should be
treated as a vulnerability.
