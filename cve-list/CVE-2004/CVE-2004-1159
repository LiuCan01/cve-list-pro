** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2004-1122,
CVE-2004-1314.  Reason: this was an out-of-band assignment duplicate
intended for one issue, but the description and references
inadvertently combined multiple issues.  Notes: All CVE users should
consult CVE-2004-1122 and CVE-2004-1314 to determine which ID is
appropriate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have
been removed to prevent accidental usage.
