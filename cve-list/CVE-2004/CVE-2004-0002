The TCP MSS (maximum segment size) functionality in netinet allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion)
via (1) a low MTU, which causes a large number of small packets to be
produced, or (2) via a large number of packets with a small TCP
payload, which cause a large number of calls to the resource-intensive
sowakeup function.
