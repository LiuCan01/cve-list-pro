Microsoft Outlook 2000 and 2003, when configured to use Microsoft Word
2000 or 2003 as the e-mail editor and when forwarding e-mail, does not
properly handle an opening OBJECT tag that does not have a closing
OBJECT tag, which causes Outlook to automatically download the URI in
the data property of the OBJECT tag and might allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code.
