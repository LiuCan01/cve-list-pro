The CleanseMessage function in shop$db.asp for VP-ASP Shopping Cart
4.0 through 5.0 does not sufficiently cleanse inputs, which allows
remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that do
not use <script> tags, as demonstrated via javascript in IMG tags to
(1) the cat parameter in shopdisplayproducts.asp or (2) the msg
parameter in shoperror.asp, and possibly other vectors.
