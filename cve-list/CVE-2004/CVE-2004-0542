PHP before 4.3.7 on Win32 platforms does not properly filter all shell
metacharacters, which allows local or remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code, overwrite files, and access internal environment
variables via (1) the "%", "|", or ">" characters to the
escapeshellcmd function, or (2) the "%" character to the
escapeshellarg function.
