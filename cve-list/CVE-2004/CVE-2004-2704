Hastymail 1.0.1 and earlier (stable) and 1.1 and earlier (development)
does not send the "attachment" parameter in the Content-Disposition
field for attachments, which causes the attachment to be rendered
inline by Internet Explorer when the victim clicks the download link,
which facilitates cross-site scripting (XSS) and possibly other
attacks.
