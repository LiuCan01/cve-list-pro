mntd_mount.c in mntd before 0.4.2 might allow local users to gain
privileges via shell metacharacters in a remount option in the
configuration file.  NOTE: It is not clear whether this is a
vulnerability because there is not necessarily any common usage in
which privilege boundaries are crossed.  Typical usage would restrict
write access to the configuration file.
