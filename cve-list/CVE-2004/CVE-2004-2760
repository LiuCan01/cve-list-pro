sshd in OpenSSH 3.5p1, when PermitRootLogin is disabled, immediately
closes the TCP connection after a root login attempt with the correct
password, but leaves the connection open after an attempt with an
incorrect password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
guess the password by observing the connection state, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.  NOTE: it could be argued that in
most environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries without
requiring leverage of a separate vulnerability.
