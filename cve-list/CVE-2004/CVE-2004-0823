OpenLDAP 1.0 through 2.1.19, as used in Apple Mac OS 10.3.4 and 10.3.5
and possibly other operating systems, may allow certain authentication
schemes to use hashed (crypt) passwords in the userPassword attribute
as if they were plaintext passwords, which allows remote attackers to
re-use hashed passwords without decrypting them.
