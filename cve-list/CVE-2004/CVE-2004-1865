Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the administration panel
in bBlog 0.7.2 allows remote authenticated users with superuser
privileges to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a blog name
($blogname).  NOTE: if administrators are normally allowed to add HTML
by other means, e.g. through Smarty templates, then this issue would
not give any additional privileges, and thus would not be considered a
vulnerability.
