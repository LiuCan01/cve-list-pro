Roaring Penguin pppoe (rp-ppoe), if installed or configured to run
setuid root contrary to its design, allows local users to overwrite
arbitrary files.  NOTE: the developer has publicly disputed the claim
that this is a vulnerability because pppoe "is NOT designed to run
setuid-root."  Therefore this identifier applies *only* to those
configurations and installations under which pppoe is run setuid root
despite the developer's warnings.

 Christey> In addition to the public statement made to Bugtraq, David
   F. Skoll, the developer of pppoe, says:
   >CVE-2004-0564 is a
   >bogus "vulnerability".  rp-pppoe is NOT meant to be installed
   >setuid-root.  One might as well file a "vulnerability" on "cat"
   >because if "cat" is setuid-root, then an "attacker" can read any file
   >on the system.
   >
   >This vulnerability is more properly a Debian vulnerability because
   >Debian ... insecurely installs rp-pppoe suid-root.
   >
   >Please add my comments to the "Comments" field of the CVE; I don't think
   >it should be blessed with an official listing.
