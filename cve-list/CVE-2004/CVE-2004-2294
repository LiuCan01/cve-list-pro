Canonicalize-before-filter error in the send_review function in the
Reviews module for PHP-Nuke 6.0 to 7.3 allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via hex-encoded XSS sequences in
the text parameter, which is checked for dangerous sequences before it
is canonicalized, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability.
