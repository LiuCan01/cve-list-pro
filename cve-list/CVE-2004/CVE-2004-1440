Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the modpow function in PuTTY
before 0.55 allow (1) remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
an SSH2 packet with a base argument that is larger than the mod
argument, which causes the modpow function to write memory before the
beginning of its buffer, and (2) remote malicious servers to cause a
denial of service (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a large bignum during authentication.
