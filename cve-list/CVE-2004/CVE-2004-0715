The WebLogic Authentication provider for BEA WebLogic Server and
WebLogic Express 8.1 through SP2 and 7.0 through SP4 does not properly
clear member relationships when a group is deleted, which can cause a
new group with the same name to have the members of the old group,
which allows group members to gain privileges.
