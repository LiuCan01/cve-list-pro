Utility Manager in Windows 2000 launches winhlp32.exe while Utility
Manager is running with raised privileges, which allows local users to
gain system privileges via a "Shatter" style attack that sends a
Windows message to cause Utility Manager to launch winhlp32 by
directly accessing the context sensitive help and bypassing the GUI,
then sending another message to winhlp32 in order to open a
user-selected file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0908.
