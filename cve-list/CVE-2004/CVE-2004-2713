** DISPUTED **

Zone Alarm Pro 1.0 through 5.1 gives full access to %windir%Internet
Logs* to the EVERYONE group, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service by modifying the folder contents or permissions.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who claims that it
does not affect product functionality since the same information is
also saved in a protected file.
