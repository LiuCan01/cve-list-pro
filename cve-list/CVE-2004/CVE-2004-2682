PeerSec MatrixSSL before 1.1 does not implement RSA blinding, which
allows context-dependent attackers to obtain the server's private key
by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the number of
extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of
different integer multiplication algorithms ("Karatsuba" and normal),
a related issue to CVE-2003-0147.
