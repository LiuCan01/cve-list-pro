cPanel, when compiling Apache 1.3.29 and PHP with the mod_phpsuexec
option, does not set the --enable-discard-path option, which causes
php to use the SCRIPT_FILENAME variable to find and execute a script
instead of the PATH_TRANSLATED variable, which allows local users to
execute arbitrary PHP code as other users via a URL that references
the attacker's script after the user's script, which executes the
attacker's script with the user's privileges, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2004-0529.
