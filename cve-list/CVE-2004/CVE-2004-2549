Nortel Wireless LAN (WLAN) Access Point (AP) 2220, 2221, and 2225
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service crash)
via a TCP request with a large string, followed by 8 newline
characters, to (1) the Telnet service on TCP port 23 and (2) the HTTP
service on TCP port 80, possibly due to a buffer overflow.
