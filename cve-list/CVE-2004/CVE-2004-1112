The buffer overflow trigger in Cisco Security Agent (CSA) before 4.0.3
build 728 waits five minutes for a user response before terminating
the process, which could allow remote attackers to bypass the buffer
overflow protection by sending additional buffer overflow attacks
within the five minute timeout period.
