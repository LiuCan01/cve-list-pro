The Apple Java plugin, as used in Netscape 7.1 and 7.2, Mozilla 1.7.2,
and Firefox 0.9.3 on MacOS X 10.3.5, when tabbed browsing is enabled,
does not properly handle SetWindow(NULL) calls, which allows Java
applets from one tab to draw to other tabs and facilitates phishing
attacks that spoof tabs.
