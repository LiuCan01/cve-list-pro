Internet Explorer 5.01 through 6 allows remote attackers to spoof
arbitrary web sites by injecting content from one window into another
window whose name is known but resides in a different domain, as
demonstrated using a pop-up window on a trusted web site, aka the
"window injection" vulnerability.  NOTE: later research shows that
Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP SP2 is also vulnerable.
