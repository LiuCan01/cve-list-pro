Dreamweaver MX, when "Using Driver On Testing Server" or "Using DSN on
Testing Server" is selected, uploads the mmhttpdb.asp script to the
web site but does not require authentication, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information and possibly execute
arbitrary SQL commands via a direct request to mmhttpdb.asp.
