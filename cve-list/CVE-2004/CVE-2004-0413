libsvn_ra_svn in Subversion 1.0.4 trusts the length field of (1)
svn://, (2) svn+ssh://, and (3) other svn protocol URL strings, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an integer
overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
