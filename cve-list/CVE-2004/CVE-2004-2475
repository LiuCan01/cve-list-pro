Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Toolbar 2.0.114.1
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script via about.html
in the About section.  NOTE: some followup posts suggest that the
demonstration code's use of the res:// protocol does not cross
privilege boundaries, since it is not allowed in the Internet Zone.
Thus this might not be a vulnerability.
