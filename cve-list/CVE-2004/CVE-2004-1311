Integer overflow in the real_setup_and_get_header function in real.c
for Unix MPlayer 1.0pre5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
Real RTSP streaming media file with a -1 content-length field, which
leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
