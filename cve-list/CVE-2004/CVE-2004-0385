Heap-based buffer overflow in Oracle 9i Application Server Web Cache
9.0.4.0.0, 9.0.3.1.0, 9.0.2.3.0, and 9.0.0.4.0 allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via a long HTTP request method header to the
Web Cache listener.  NOTE: due to the vagueness of the Oracle
advisory, it is not clear whether there are additional issues besides
this overflow, although the advisory alludes to multiple
"vulnerabilities."
