** UNVERIFIABLE **

SQL injection vulnerability in PunkBuster Screenshot Database (PB-DB)
Alpha 6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
the username and password fields of the login form.  NOTE: the
original vulnerability report contains several significant
inconsistencies that make it unclear whether the report is accurate,
including (1) PB-DB is really the "PunkBuster Screenshot Database" and
not "PunkBuster" itself; (2) there is no apparent association between
PunkBuster and "Punky Brewster"; (3) the claimed source code is not
anywhere in Alpha 6.
