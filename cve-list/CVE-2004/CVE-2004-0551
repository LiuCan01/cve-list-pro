Cisco CatOS 5.x before 5.5(20) through 8.x before 8.2(2) and
8.3(2)GLX, as used in Catalyst switches, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (system crash and reload) by sending invalid
packets instead of the final ACK portion of the three-way handshake to
the (1) Telnet, (2) HTTP, or (3) SSH services, aka "TCP-ACK DoS
attack."
