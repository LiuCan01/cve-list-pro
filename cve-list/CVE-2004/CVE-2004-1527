Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 does not properly handle certain
character strings in the Path attribute, which can cause it to modify
cookies in other domains when the attacker's domain name is within the
target's domain name or when wildcard DNS is being used, which allows
remote attackers to hijack web sessions.
