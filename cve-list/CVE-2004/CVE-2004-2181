Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in WowBB Forum 1.61 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) sort_by
or (2) page parameters to view_user.php, or the (3) forum_id parameter
to view_topic.php.  NOTE: the sort_by vector was later reported to be
present in WowBB 1.65.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> The view_user.php/sort_by vector is covered by several CVEs.
   Need to figure out how to handle this.
