Buffer overflow in XBoard 4.2.7 and earlier might allow local users to
execute arbitrary code via a long -icshost command line argument.
NOTE: since the program is not setuid and not normally called from
remote programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the
issue that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a
vulnerability.
