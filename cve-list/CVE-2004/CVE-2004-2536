The exit_thread function (process.c) in Linux kernel 2.6 through 2.6.5
does not invalidate the per-TSS io_bitmap pointers if a process
obtains IO access permissions from the ioperm function but does not
drop those permissions when it exits, which allows other processes to
access the per-TSS pointers, access restricted memory locations, and
possibly gain privileges.
