Ratbag game engine, as used in products such as Dirt Track Racing,
Leadfoot, and World of Outlaws Spring Cars, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a TCP packet that
specifies the length of data to read and then sends a second TCP
packet that contains less data than specified, which causes Ratbag to
repeatedly check the socket for more data.
