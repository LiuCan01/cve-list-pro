Xlight 1.52, with log to screen enabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service by requesting a long directory consisting of
. (dot) and / (slash) characters, which causes the server to crash
when the administrator views the log file, possibly triggering a
buffer overflow.

   In the above URL, the vendor says that only one of 3 bugs
   reported in February 2004 were an "actual server bug," and the other 2
   "traced back into windows' dll and they won't happen if windows
   service pack is installed.
   
   The "actual server bug" is CVE-2004-0287.  The demonstration
   for *this* issue shows that the application breaks in comctl32.dll.
   So, this candidate may be erroneous, and an interesting side effect of
   another bug that's not related to xlight at all.
   
   Thus, this candidate may need to be REJECTED.
