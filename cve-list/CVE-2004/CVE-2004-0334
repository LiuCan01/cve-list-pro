InnoMedia VideoPhone allows remote attackers to bypass Basic
Authorization via an HTTP request to (1) videophone_admindetail.asp,
(2) videophone_syscfg.asp, (3) videophone_upgrade.asp, or (4)
videophone_sysctrl.asp that contains a trailing / (slash).  NOTE: the
original report mentioned AXIS 2100 Network Camera, but this was
likely a cut-and-paste error.
