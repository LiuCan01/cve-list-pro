The (1) address.html and possibly (2) calendar.html pages in Merak
Mail Server 5.2.7 allow remote attackers to gain sensitive information
via an invalid HTTP request, which reveals the installation path.
NOTE: it is unclear whether the calendar.html is an exposure, since
the path is leaked in web logs that may only be available to the
administrators, who would have access to the path through legitimate
means.
