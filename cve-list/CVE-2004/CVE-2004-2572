AMAX Magic Winmail Server 3.6 allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information by entering (1) invalid characters such as "()"
or (2) a large number of characters in the Lookup field on the
netaddressbook.php web form, which reveals the path in an ldaplib.php
error message when the ldap_search function fails, due to improper
processing of the $keyword variable.
