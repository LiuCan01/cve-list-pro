Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the ICQ parsing routines of
the ISS Protocol Analysis Module (PAM) component, as used in various
RealSecure, Proventia, and BlackICE products, allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via a SRV_MULTI response containing a
SRV_USER_ONLINE response packet and a SRV_META_USER response packet
with long (1) nickname, (2) firstname, (3) lastname, or (4) email
address fields, as exploited by the Witty worm.
