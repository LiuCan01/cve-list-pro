Konqueror 3.x up to 3.2.2-6, and possibly other versions, allows
remote attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites by injecting content
from one window into a target window or tab whose name is known but
resides in a different domain, as demonstrated using a pop-up window
on a trusted web site, aka the "window injection" vulnerability.
