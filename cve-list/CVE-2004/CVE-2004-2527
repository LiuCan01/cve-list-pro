The local and remote desktop login screens in Microsoft Windows XP
before SP2 and 2003 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (CPU and memory consumption) by repeatedly using the
WinKey+"U" key combination, which causes multiple copies of Windows
Utility Manager to be loaded more quickly than they can be closed when
the copies detect that another instance is running.
