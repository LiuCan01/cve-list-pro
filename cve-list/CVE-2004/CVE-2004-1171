KDE 3.2.x and 3.3.0 through 3.3.2, when saving credentials that are
(1) manually entered by the user or (2) created by the SMB protocol
handler, stores those credentials for plaintext in the user's .desktop
file, which may be created with world-readable permissions, which
could allow local users to obtain usernames and passwords for remote
resources such as SMB shares.
