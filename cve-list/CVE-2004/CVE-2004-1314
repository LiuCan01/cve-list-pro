Safari 1.x allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites by
injecting content from one window into a target window whose name is
known but resides in a different domain, as demonstrated using a
pop-up window on a trusted web site, aka the "window injection"
vulnerability, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1122.
