The URL pattern matching feature in BEA WebLogic Server 6.x matches
illegal patterns ending in "*" as wildcards as if they were the legal
"/*" pattern, which could cause WebLogic 7.x to allow remote attackers
to bypass intended access restrictions because the illegal patterns
are properly rejected.
