The Lithtech engine, as used in (1) Contract Jack 1.1 and earlier, (2)
No one lives forever 2 1.3 and earlier, (3) Tron 2.0 1.042 and
earlier, (4) F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault and Recon), and
possibly other games, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (connection refused) via a UDP packet that causes recvfrom to
generate a return code that causes the listening loop to exit, as
demonstrated using zero byte packets or packets between 8193 and 12280
bytes, which result in conditions that are not "Operation would
block."
