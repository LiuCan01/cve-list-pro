** DISPUTED **
Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, and possibly 2003 allows local users with
the SeDebugPrivilege privilege to execute arbitrary code as kernel and
read or write kernel memory via the NtSystemDebugControl function,
which does not verify its pointer arguments.  Note: this issue has
been disputed, since Administrator privileges are typically required
to exploit this issue, thus privilege boundaries are not crossed.
