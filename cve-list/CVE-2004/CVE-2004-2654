The clientAbortBody function in client_side.c in Squid Web Proxy Cache
before 2.6 STABLE6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (segmentation fault) via unspecified vectors that trigger a
null dereference.  NOTE: in a followup advisory, a researcher claimed
that the issue was a buffer overflow that was not fixed in STABLE6.
However, the vendor's bug report clearly shows that the researcher
later retracted this claim, because the tested product was actually
STABLE5.
