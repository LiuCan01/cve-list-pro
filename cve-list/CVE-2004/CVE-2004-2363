Validate-Before-Canonicalize vulnerability in the checkURI function in
functions.inc.php in PHPX 3.0 through 3.2.6 allows remote attackers to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via hex-encoded tags, which
bypass the check for literal "<", ">", "(", and ")" characters, as
demonstrated using the limit parameter to forums.php and a variety of
other vectors.
