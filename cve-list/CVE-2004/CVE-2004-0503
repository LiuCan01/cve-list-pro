Microsoft Outlook 2003 allows remote attackers to bypass the default
zone restrictions and execute script within media files via a Rich
Text Format (RTF) message containing an OLE object for the Windows
Media Player, which bypasses Media Player's setting to disallow
scripting and may lead to unprompted installation of an executable
when exploited in conjunction with predictable-file-location exposures
such as CVE-2004-0502.
