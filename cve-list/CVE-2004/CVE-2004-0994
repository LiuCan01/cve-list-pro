Multiple integer overflows in xzgv 0.8 and earlier allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via images with large width and
height values, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, as
demonstrated in the read_prf_file function in readprf.c.  NOTE:
CVE-2004-0994 and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of bugs that only
partially overlap, despite having the same developer.  Therefore, they
should be regarded as distinct.
