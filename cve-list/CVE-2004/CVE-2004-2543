Secure Computing Corporation Sidewinder G2 6.1.0.01 might allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (proxy failure) via invalid
traffic to the (1) T.120 or (2) RTSP proxy, or (3) invalid MIME
messages to the mail filter.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability
because the embedded monitoring sub-system automatically restarts
after the failure.
