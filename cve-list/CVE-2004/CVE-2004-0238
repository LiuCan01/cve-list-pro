Multiple buffer overflows in Overkill (0verkill) 0.15pre3 might allow
local users to execute arbitrary code in the client via a long HOME
environment variable in the (1) load_cfg and (2) save_cfg functions;
possibly allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long
strings to (3) the send_message function; and, in the server,
via (4) the parse_command_line function.
