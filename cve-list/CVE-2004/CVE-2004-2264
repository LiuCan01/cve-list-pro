** DISPUTED **
Format string bug in the open_altfile function in filename.c for GNU
less 382, 381, and 358 might allow local users to cause a denial of
service or possibly execute arbitrary code via format strings in the
LESSOPEN environment variable. NOTE: since less is not setuid or
setgid, then this is not a vulnerability unless there are plausible
scenarios under which privilege boundaries could be crossed.
