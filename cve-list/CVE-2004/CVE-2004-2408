Linux VServer 1.27 and earlier, 1.3.9 and earlier, and 1.9.1 and
earlier shares /proc permissions across all virtual and host servers,
which allows local users with the ability to set permissions in /proc
to obtain system information or cause a denial of service on other
virtual servers or the host server.
