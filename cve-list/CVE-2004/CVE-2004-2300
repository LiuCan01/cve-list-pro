Buffer overflow in snmpd in ucd-snmp 4.2.6 and earlier, when installed
setuid root, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long
-p command line argument.  NOTE: it is not clear whether there are any
standard configurations in which snmpd is installed setuid or
setgid. If not, then this issue should not be included in CVE.
