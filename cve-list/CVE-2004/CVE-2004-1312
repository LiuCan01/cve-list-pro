A bug in the HTML parser in a certain Microsoft HTML library, as used
in various third party products, may allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service via certain strings, as reported in GFI
MailEssentials for Exchange 9 and 10, and GFI MailSecurity for
Exchange 8, which causes emails to remain in IIS or Exchange mail
queues.
