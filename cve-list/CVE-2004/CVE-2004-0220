isakmpd in OpenBSD 3.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service via an ISAKMP packet with a malformed Cert Request
payload, which causes an integer underflow that is used in a malloc
operation that is not properly handled, as demonstrated by the
Striker ISAKMP Protocol Test Suite.
