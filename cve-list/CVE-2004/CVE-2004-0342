WFTPD Pro Server 3.21 Release 1, with the XeroxDocutech option
enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
(1) MKD or (2) XMKD command that causes an absolute path of 260
characters to be used, which overwrites a cookie with a null
character, possibly due to an off-by-one error.
