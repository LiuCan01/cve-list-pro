Quake II server before R1Q2, as used in multiple products, allows
remote attackers to corrupt the server's client state data structure
by exiting a session without a valid disconnect command, then
reconnecting, which prevents a mod from being notified of changes in
the client state.  NOTE: the impact of this issue will vary depending
on which mod is being used.
