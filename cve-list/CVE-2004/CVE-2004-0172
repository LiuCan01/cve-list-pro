Heap-based buffer overflow in the search_for_command function of
ltrace 0.3.10, if it is installed setuid, could allow local users to
execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: It is unclear
whether there are any packages that install ltrace as a setuid
program, so this candidate might be REJECTed.
