Quake II server before R1Q2, as used in multiple products, allows
remote attackers to bypass IP-based access control rules via a
userinfo string that already contains an "ip" key/value pair but is
also long enough to cause a new key/value pair to be truncated, which
interferes with the server's ability to find the client's IP address.
