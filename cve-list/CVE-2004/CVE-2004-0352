Voter Comments:
 Christey> According to the Details section of the advisory, the
   vulnerability can only be exploited through the management port, which
   is "available solely through the physical management interface."  So,
   change the description to point out that physical access is required.
   Thanks to esCERT-UPC for pointing this out.
