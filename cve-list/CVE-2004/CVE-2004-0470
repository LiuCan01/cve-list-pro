BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 7.0 through SP5 and 8.1
through SP2, when editing weblogic.xml using WebLogic Builder or the
SecurityRoleAssignmentMBean.toXML method, inadvertently removes
security-role-assignment tags when weblogic.xml does not have a
principal-name tag, which can remove intended access restrictions for
the associated web application.
