mailpost.exe in MailPost 5.1.1sv, and possibly earlier versions,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash),
leak sensitive pathname information in the resulting error message,
and execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via an HTTP request
that contains a / (backslash) and arbitrary webscript before the
requested file, which leaks the pathname and does not quote the script
in the resulting Visual Basic error message.
