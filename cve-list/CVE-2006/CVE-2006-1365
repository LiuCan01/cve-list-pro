Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/428431/100/0/threaded

The Motorola PEBL U6, the Motorola V600, and possibly the Motorola
E398 and other Motorola phones allow remote attackers to add an entry
for their own Bluetooth device to a target device's list of trusted
devices (aka Device History), and possibly obtain AT level access to
the target device, by initiating and interrupting an OBEX Push Profile
that pretends to send a vCard, aka a "HeloMoto" attack.
