Stack-based buffer overflow in Python 2.4.2 and earlier, running on
Linux 2.6.12.5 under gcc 4.0.3 with libc 2.3.5, allows local users to
cause a "stack overflow," and possibly gain privileges, by running a
script from a current working directory that has a long name, related
to the realpath function.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability.
However, the fact that it appears in a programming language
interpreter could mean that some applications are affected, although
attack scenarios might be limited because the attacker might already
need to cross privilege boundaries to cause an exploitable program to
be placed in a directory with a long name; or, depending on the method
that Python uses to determine the current working directory, setuid
applications might be affected.
