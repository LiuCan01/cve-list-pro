** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in libs/Smarty.class.php in
Smarty 2.6.9 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
a URL in the filename parameter.  NOTE: in the original disclosure,
filename is used in a function definition, so this report is probably
incorrect.
