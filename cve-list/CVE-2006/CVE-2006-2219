phpBB 2.0.20 does not verify user-specified input variable types
before being passed to type-dependent functions, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information, as demonstrated by the (1)
mode parameter to memberlist.php and the (2) highlight parameter to
viewtopic.php that are used as an argument to the htmlspecialchars or
urlencode functions, which displays the installation path in the
resulting error message.
