Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 allows remote attackers to (1) cause a
security certificate from a secure web site to appear invalid via a
link to res://ieframe.dll/sslnavcancel.htm with the target site in the
anchor identifier, which displays the site's URL in the address bar
but causes Internet Explorer to report that the certificate is
invalid, or (2) trigger a "The webpage no longer exists" report via a
link to res://ieframe.dll/http_410.htm, a variant of CVE-2006-5805.
