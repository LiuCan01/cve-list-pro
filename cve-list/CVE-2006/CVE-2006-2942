TWiki 4.0.0, 4.0.1, and 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to gain Twiki
administrator privileges via a TWiki.TWikiRegistration form with a
modified action attribute that references the Sandbox web instead of
the user web, which can then be used to associate the user's login
name with the WikiName of a member of the TWikiAdminGroup.
