system/workplace/views/admin/admin-main.jsp in Alkacon OpenCms before
6.2.2 does not restrict access to administrator functions, which
allows remote authenticated users to (1) send broadcast messages to
all users (/workplace/broadcast), (2) list all users
(/accounts/users), (3) add webusers (/accounts/webusers/new), (4)
upload database import and export files (/database/importhttp), (5)
upload arbitrary program modules (/modules/modules_import), and (6)
read the log file (/workplace/logfileview) by setting the appropriate
value for the path parameter in a direct request to admin-main.jsp.
