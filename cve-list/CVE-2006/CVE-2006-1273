** DISPUTED **

Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and 1.5.0.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) via an HTML tag with a large number of
script action handlers such as onload and onmouseover, which triggers
the crash when the user views the page source.  NOTE: Red Hat has
disputed this issue, suggesting that "It is likely the reporter was
running the IE Tab extension," and Mozilla also confirmed that this is
not an issue in Firefox itself.
