** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in cls_fast_template.php in
myWebland miniBloggie 1.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the fname parameter.  NOTE:
another researcher was unable to find a way to execute code after
including it via a URL.  CVE analysis as of 20060816 was inconclusive.
