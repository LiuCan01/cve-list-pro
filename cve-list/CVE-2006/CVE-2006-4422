** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
includes/phpdig/libs/search_function.php in Jetbox CMS 2.1 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
relative_script_path parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-2270.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed, and as of 20060830, CVE analysis
concurs with the dispute.  In addition, it is likely that the
vulnerability is actually in a third party module, phpDig 1.8.8.
