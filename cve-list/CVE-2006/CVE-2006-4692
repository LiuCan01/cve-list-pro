Argument injection vulnerability in the Windows Object Packager
(packager.exe) in Microsoft Windows XP SP1 and SP2 and Server 2003 SP1
and earlier allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary
commands via a crafted file with a "/" (slash) character in the
filename of the Command Line property, followed by a valid file
extension, which causes the command before the slash to be executed,
aka "Object Packager Dialogue Spoofing Vulnerability."
