details.php in Easy Ad-Manager allows remote attackers to obtain the
full installation path via an invalid mbid parameter, which leaks the
path in an error message.  NOTE: this might be resultant from another
vulnerability, since this vector also produces cross-site scripting
(XSS).  NOTE: on 20060829, the vendor notified CVE that this issue has
been fixed.
