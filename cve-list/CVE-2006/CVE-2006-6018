** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in mybic_server.php in Jim
Plush My-BIC 0.6.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the INC_PATH parameter, a different vector than
CVE-2006-5089.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE and third party
researchers because INC_PATH is a constant.
