** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ow.asp in OpenWiki 0.78
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
p parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor and a
third party who is affiliated with the product.  The vendor states
"You cannot insert code in a wikipage or via URL parameters as they
are all escaped before usage, so nothing can be compromised at other
sites."
