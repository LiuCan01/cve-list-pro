** DISPUTED **

MySQL 5.0.18 allows local users with access to a VIEW to obtain
sensitive information via the "SELECT * FROM
information_schema.views;" query, which returns the query that created
the VIEW.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties, saying
that the availability of the schema is a normal and sometimes desired
aspect of database access.
