Jeroen Vennegoor JevonCMS, possibly pre alpha, allows remote attackers
to obtain sensitive information via a direct request for
php/main/phplib files (1) db_msql.inc, (2) db_mssql.inc, (3)
db_mysql.inc, (4) db_oci8.inc, (5) db_odbc.inc, (6) db_oracle.inc, and
(7) db_pgsql.inc; and (8) db_sybase.inc, which reveals the path in
various error messages.
