Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Netrix X-Site Manager
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
product_id parameter, as originally demonstrated for a custom
mp3players_details.php program.  NOTE: the name of the affected
program might be installation-dependent, but it has been identified as
"product_details.php" by some sources.
