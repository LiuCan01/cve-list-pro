Stack-based buffer overflow in the IMAP service in Mercur Messaging
5.0 SP3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
long string to the (1) LOGIN or (2) SELECT command, a different set of
attack vectors and possibly a different vulnerability than
CVE-2003-1177.
