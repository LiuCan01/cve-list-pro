Nessus before 2.2.8, and 3.x before 3.0.3, allows user-assisted
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a NASL
script that calls split with an invalid sep parameter.  NOTE: a design
goal of the NASL language is to facilitate sharing of security tests
by guaranteeing that a script "can not do anything nasty."  This issue
is appropriate for CVE only if Nessus users have an expectation that a
split statement will not use excessive memory.
