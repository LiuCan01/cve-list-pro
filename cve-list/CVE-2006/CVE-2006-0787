wimpy_trackplays.php in Plaino Wimpy MP3 Player, possibly 5.2 and
earlier, allows remote attackers to insert arbitrary strings into
trackme.txt via the (1) trackFile, (2) trackArtist, and (3) trackTitle
parameters, which can result in providing false information about
songs, occupying excessive disk space with very long parameter values,
and storing executable code that might be invoked through a different
vulnerability.  NOTE: since this issue, as described by the original
researcher, is entirely dependent on the presence of another
vulnerability, it could be argued that Wimpy cannot be responsible for
how its data file is processed by applications outside of its control.
Since this issue might only be useful as a facilitator manipulation in
another vulnerability, perhaps it should not be included in CVE.
