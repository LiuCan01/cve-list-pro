** DISPUTED **

Tor before 0.1.1.20 kills the circuit when it receives an unrecognized
relay command, which causes network circuits to be disbanded.  NOTE:
while this item is listed under the "Security fixes" section of the
developer changelog, the developer clarified on 20060707 that this is
only a self-DoS.  Therefore this issue should not be included in CVE.
