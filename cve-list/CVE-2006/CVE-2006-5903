Rahul Jonna Gmail File Space (GSpace) allows remote attackers to
perform virtual filesystem actions via e-mail messages with certain
subject lines, as demonstrated by (1) a GSPACE "2174|1|1|1|gs:/ d$"
message, which injects a new file into the filesystem; and (2) a
GSPACE "|-135|1|1|0|gs:/ d$" message, which creates a folder.
