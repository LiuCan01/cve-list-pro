Tor allows remote attackers to discover the IP address of a hidden
service by accessing this service at a high rate, thereby changing the
server's CPU temperature and consequently changing the pattern of time
values visible through (1) ICMP timestamps, (2) TCP sequence numbers,
and (3) TCP timestamps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0414.
NOTE: it could be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability
that is a fundamental design limitation of certain hardware
implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
