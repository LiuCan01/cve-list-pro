Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Softcomplex PHP Event
Calendar 1.5 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML, and corrupt data, via the (1) username and (2)
password parameters, which are not sanitized before being written to
users.php.  NOTE: while this issue was originally reported as XSS, the
primary issue might be direct static code injection with resultant
XSS.
