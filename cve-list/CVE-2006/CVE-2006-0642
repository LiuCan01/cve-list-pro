Trend Micro ServerProtect 5.58, and possibly InterScan Messaging
Security Suite and InterScan Web Security Suite, have a default
configuration setting of "Do not scan compressed files when Extracted
file count exceeds 500 files," which may be too low in certain
circumstances, which allows remote attackers to bypass anti-virus
checks by sending compressed archives containing many small files.
NOTE: since this is related to a configuration setting that has an
operational impact that might vary depending on the environment, and
the product is claimed to report a message when the compressed file
exceeds specified limits, perhaps this should not be included in CVE.
