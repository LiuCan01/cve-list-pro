Directory traversal vulnerability in LinPHA 1.0 allows remote
attackers to include arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences in the
(1) lang parameter in docs/index.php and the language parameter in (2)
install/install.php, (3) install/sec_stage_install.php, (4)
install/third_stage_install.php, and (5)
install/forth_stage_install.php.  NOTE: direct static code injection
is resultant from this issue, as demonstrated by inserting PHP code
into the username, which is inserted into linpha.log, which is
accessible from the directory traversal.
