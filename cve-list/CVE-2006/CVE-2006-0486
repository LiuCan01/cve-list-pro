Certain Cisco IOS releases in 12.2S based trains with maintenance
release number 25 and later, 12.3T based trains, and 12.4 based trains
reuse a Tcl Shell process across login sessions of different local
users on the same terminal if the first user does not use tclquit
before exiting, which may cause subsequent local users to execute
unintended commands or bypass AAA command authorization checks, aka
Bug ID CSCef77770.
