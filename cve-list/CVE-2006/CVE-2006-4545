** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in ModuleBased CMS Pre-Alpha
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the _SERVER
parameter in (1) admin/avatar.php, (2) libs/archive.class.php, (3)
libs/login.php, (4) libs/profiles.class.php, and (5)
libs/profile/proccess.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes this claim, as the
_SERVER array and the _SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT] index are controlled by
PHP and cannot be manipulated by an attacker.
