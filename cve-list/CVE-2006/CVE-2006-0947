Thomson SpeedTouch modem running firmware 5.3.2.6.0 allows remote
attackers to create users that cannot be deleted via scripting code in
the "31" parameter in a NewUser function, which is not filtered by the
modem when creating the account, but cannot be deleted by the
administrator, possibly due to cleansing that occurs in the
administrator interface.
