cms_images/js/htmlarea/htmlarea.php in phpFaber Content Management
System (CMS) before 1.3.36 on 20061026 allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML, probably via arbitrary parameters
in the query string, as demonstrated with a vigilon parameter.  NOTE:
earlier downloads of 1.3.36 have the vulnerability; the software was
updated without changing the version number.
