The pswd.js script relies on the client to calculate whether a
username and password match hard-coded hashed values for a server, and
uses a hashing scheme that creates a large number of collisions, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct offline brute force
attacks.  NOTE: this script might also allow attackers to generate the
server-side "secret" URL without determining the original password,
but this possibility was not discussed by the original researcher.
