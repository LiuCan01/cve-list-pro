The (1) fwdrv.sys and (2) khips.sys drivers in Sunbelt Kerio Personal
Firewall 4.3.268 and earlier do not validate arguments passed through
to SSDT functions, including NtCreateFile, NtDeleteFile, NtLoadDriver,
NtMapViewOfSection, NtOpenFile, and NtSetInformationFile, which allows
local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly other
impacts via unspecified vectors.
