A third-party installer generation tool, possibly BitRock
InstallBuilder, as used in products including Process-one ejabberd
1.1.1_1 and earlier, generates an installer that allows local users to
cause a denial of service via a symlink attack on the
bitrock_installer.log temporary file.  NOTE: it is possible that this
vulnerability is present in other products that use this installer.
