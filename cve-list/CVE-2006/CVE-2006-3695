Trac before 0.9.6 does not disable the "raw" or "include" commands
when providing untrusted users with restructured text
(reStructuredText) functionality from docutils, which allows remote
attackers to read arbitrary files, perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks, or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors. NOTE:
this might be related to CVE-2006-3458.
