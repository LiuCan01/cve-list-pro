IBM Tivoli Micromuse Netcool/NeuSecure 3.0.236 configures a MySQL
database to allow connections from any source IP address with the ns
database account, which allows remote attackers to bypass the
Netcool/NeuSecure application layer and perform unauthorized database
actions.  NOTE: IBM has privately confirmed to CVE that a fix is
available for these issues.
