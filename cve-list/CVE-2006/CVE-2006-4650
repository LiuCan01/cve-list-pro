Cisco IOS 12.0, 12.1, and 12.2, when GRE IP tunneling is used and the
RFC2784 compliance fixes are missing, does not verify the offset field
of a GRE packet during decapsulation, which leads to an integer
overflow that references data from incorrect memory locations, which
allows remote attackers to inject crafted packets into the routing
queue, possibly bypassing intended router ACLs.
