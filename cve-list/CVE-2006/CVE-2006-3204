Ultimate PHP Board (UPB) 1.9.6 and earlier uses a cryptographically
weak block cipher with a large key collision space, which allows
remote attackers to determine a suitable decryption key given the
plaintext and ciphertext by obtaining the plaintext password, which is
sent when logging in, and the ciphertext, which is set in the pass_env
cookie.
