Buffer overflow in the parse function in parse.c in zoo 2.10 might
allow local users to execute arbitrary code via long filename command
line arguments, which are not properly handled during archive
creation.  NOTE: since this issue is local and not setuid, the set of
attack scenarios is limited, although is reasonable to expect that
there are some situations in which the zoo user might automatically
list attacker-controlled filenames to add to the zoo archive.
