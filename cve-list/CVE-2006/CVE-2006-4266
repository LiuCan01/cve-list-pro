Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2006 9.1.0.33, and possibly earlier,
does not properly protect Norton registry keys, which allows local
users to provide Trojan horse libraries to Norton by using RegSaveKey
and RegRestoreKey to modify HKLMSOFTWARESymantecCCPDSuiteOwners,
as demonstrated using NISProd.dll.  NOTE: in most cases, this attack
would not cross privilege boundaries, because modifying the
SuiteOwners key requires administrative privileges.  However, this
issue is a vulnerability because the product's functionality is
intended to protect against privileged actions such as this.
