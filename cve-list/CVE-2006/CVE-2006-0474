Multiple integer overflows in Shareaza 2.2.1.0 allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via (1) a large packet length field, which
causes an overflow in the ReadBuffer function in (a) BTPacket.cpp and
(b) EDPacket.cpp, or (2) a large packet, which causes a heap-based
overflow in the Write function in (c) Packet.h.
