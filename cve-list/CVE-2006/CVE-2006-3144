micro_cms_files/microcms-include.php in Implied By Design (IBD) Micro
CMS 3.5 (aka 0.3.5) and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the microcms_path parameter.  NOTE: it
was later reported that this can also be leveraged to include and
execute arbitrary local files via .. (dot dot) sequences.
