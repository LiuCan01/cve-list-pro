Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Teake Nutma
Foing, as modified in Fully Modded phpBB (phpbbfm) 2021.4.40 and
earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the foing_root_path parameter in (a) faq.php, (b) index.php,
(c) list.php, (d) login.php, (e) playlist.php, (f) song.php, (g)
gen_m3u.php, (h) view_artist.php, (i) view_song.php, (j)
flash/set_na.php, (k) flash/initialise.php, (l) flash/get_song.php,
(m) includes/common.php, (n) admin/nav.php, (o) admin/main.php, (p)
admin/list_artists.php, (q) admin/index.php, (r) admin/genres.php, (s)
admin/edit_artist.php, (t) admin/edit_album.php, (u) admin/config.php,
and (v) admin/admin_status.php in player/, different vectors than
CVE-2006-3045.  NOTE: CVE analysis as of 20061026 indicates that files
in the admin/ and flash/ directories define foing_root_path before
use.
