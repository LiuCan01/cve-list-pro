Multiple integer overflows in OpenOffice.org (OOo) 2.0.4 and earlier,
and possibly other versions before 2.1.0; and StarOffice 6 through 8;
allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted (a) WMF or (b) EMF file that triggers heap-based buffer
overflows in (1) wmf/winwmf.cxx, during processing of META_ESCAPE
records; and wmf/enhwmf.cxx, during processing of (2) EMR_POLYPOLYGON
and (3) EMR_POLYPOLYGON16 records.
