Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Xtreme Topsites
1.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
the (1) id parameter in stats.php and (2) unspecified inputs in
lostid.php, probably the searchthis parameter.  NOTE: one or more of
these vectors might be resultant from SQL injection.
