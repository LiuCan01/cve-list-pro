Stack-based buffer overflow in the (1) swpackage and (2) swmodify
commands in HP-UX B.11.11 and possibly other versions allows local
users to execute arbitrary code via a long -S argument.  NOTE: this
might be a duplicate of CVE-2006-2574, but the details relating to
CVE-2006-2574 are too vague to be certain.
