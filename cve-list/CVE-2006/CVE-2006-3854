Buffer overflow in IBM Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) 9.40.TC7,
9.40.TC8, 10.00.TC4, and 10.00.TC5, when running on Windows, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long username, which
causes an overflow in vsprintf when displaying in the resulting error
message.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for
CVE-2006-3853.
