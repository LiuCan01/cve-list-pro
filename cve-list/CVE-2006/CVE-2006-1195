The enet_protocol_handle_send_fragment function in protocol.c for ENet
library CVS version Jul 2005 and earlier, as used in products
including (1) Cube, (2) Sauerbraten, and (3) Duke3d_w32, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a
packet fragment with a large total data size, which triggers an
application abort when memory allocation fails.
