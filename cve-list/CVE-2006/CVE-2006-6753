Event Viewer (eventvwr.exe) in Microsoft Windows does not properly
display log data that contains '%' (percent) characters, which might
make it impossible to use Event Viewer to determine the actual data
that triggered an event, and might produce long strings that are not
properly handled by certain processes that rely on Event Viewer.
