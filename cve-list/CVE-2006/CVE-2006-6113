Monkey Boards 0.3.5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via direct requests to (1) include/admin_auth.inc.php and
(2) include/engine/class.compiler.php, which reveals the full path in
an error message.  NOTE: this issue is only an exposure if the
administrator has changed the default script path.
