SQL injection vulnerability in EasyPage allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors in
sptrees/default.aspx, possibly involving the docId parameter.  NOTE:
this issue appears to have been disputed by a third party researcher,
stating that SQL injection is not possible. However, insufficient
details were provided to evaluate the dispute.
