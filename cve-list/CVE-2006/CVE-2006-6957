PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in addons/mod_media/body.php
in Docebo 3.0.3 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
GLOBALS[where_framework] parameter.  NOTE: this issue might be
resultant from a global overwrite vulnerability. This issue is similar
to CVE-2006-2576 and CVE-2006-3107, but the vectors are different.
