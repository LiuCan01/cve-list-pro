Buffer overflow in Unicode processing in the logging functionality in
Pablo Software Solutions Quick 'n Easy FTP Server Professional and
Lite, probably 3.0, allows remote authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code by sending a command with a long argument, which
triggers a buffer overflow when an admin selects the Logging section
in the FTP server main window.  NOTE: the original researcher claims
that the vendor disputes this issue.
