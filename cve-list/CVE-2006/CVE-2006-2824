Logicalware MailManager before 2.0.10 does not remove 0xc8 0x27 (0xc8
followed by a single-quote character) from the data stream to the
server, which allows remote attackers to modify data and gain
administrative access when PostgreSQL is used, aka "bug #1494281 -
Postgres encoding security hole."  NOTE: while this issue involves
PostgreSQL, it is specific to MailManager's interface to PostgreSQL
and is therefore a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-2313 and
CVE-2006-2314.
