WHMCompleteSolution (WHMCS) before 2.3 assigns incorrect permissions
to "resellers", which allows remote authenticated users to perform
privileged actions or obtain sensitive information.  NOTE: this report
is based on a vendor bug report that identified "incorrect
permissions."  However, the vendor did not label it a security issue,
and there was no statement regarding whether or not the permissions
were actually more permissive than intended.  If in fact the
permissions were more restrictive than intended, then this would be a
functional problem but not a vulnerability.
