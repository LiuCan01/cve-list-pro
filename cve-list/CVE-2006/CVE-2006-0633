The make_password function in ipsclass.php in Invision Power Board
(IPB) 2.1.4 uses random data generated from partially predictable
seeds to create the authentication code that is sent by e-mail to a
user with a lost password, which might make it easier for remote
attackers to guess the code and change the password for an IPB
account, possibly involving millions of requests.
