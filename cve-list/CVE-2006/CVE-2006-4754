Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in PHProg before
1.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
the album parameter, which is used in an opendir call.  NOTE: the same
primary issue can be used for full path disclosure with an invalid
parameter that reveals the installation path in an error message.
