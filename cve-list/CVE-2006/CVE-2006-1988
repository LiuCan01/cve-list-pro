The WebTextRenderer(WebInternal) _CG_drawRun:style:geometry: function
in Apple Safari 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via an HTML LI tag with a large VALUE
attribute (list item number), which triggers a null dereference in
QPainter::drawText, probably due to a failed memory allocation that
uses the VALUE.
