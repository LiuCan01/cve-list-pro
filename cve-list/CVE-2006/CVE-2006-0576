Untrusted search path vulnerability in opcontrol in OProfile 0.9.1 and
earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a
modified PATH that references malicious (1) which or (2) dirname
programs.  NOTE: while opcontrol normally is not run setuid, a common
configuration suggests accessing opcontrol using sudo.  In such a
context, this is a vulnerability.
