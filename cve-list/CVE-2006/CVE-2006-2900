Internet Explorer 6 allows user-assisted remote attackers to read
arbitrary files by tricking a user into typing the characters of the
target filename in a text box and using the OnKeyDown, OnKeyPress, and
OnKeyUp Javascript keystroke events to change the focus and cause
those characters to be inserted into a file upload input control,
which can then upload the file when the user submits the form.
