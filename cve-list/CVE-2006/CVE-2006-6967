** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this
candidate is solely about a configuration that does not directly
introduce security vulnerabilities, so it is more appropriate to cover
under the Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE).  In addition, it
describes standard behavior (publication of revocation lists) and as
such does not cross privilege boundaries.  Notes: the former
description is: "Check Point FireWall-1 allows remote attackers to
obtain certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and other unspecified
sensitive information via an HTTP request for the top-level URI on the
internal certificate authority (ICA) port (18264/tcp)."
