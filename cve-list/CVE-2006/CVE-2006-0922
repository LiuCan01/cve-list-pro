CubeCart 3.0 through 3.6 does not properly check authorization for an
administration session because of a missing auth.inc.php include,
which results in an absolute path traversal vulnerability in
FileUpload in connector.php (aka upload.php) that allows remote
attackers to upload arbitrary files via a modified CurrentFolder
parameter in a direct request to admin/filemanager/upload.php.
