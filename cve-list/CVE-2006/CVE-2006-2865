** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in template.php in phpBB 2
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
page parameter.  NOTE: followup posts have disputed this issue,
stating that template.php does not appear in phpBB and does not use a
$page variable.  It is possible that this is a site-specific
vulnerability, or an issue in a mod.
