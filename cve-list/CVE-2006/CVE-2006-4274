** REJECT **

Unknown vulnerability in Microsoft PowerPoint allows user-assisted
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PPT document, as
exploited by malware such as TROJ_MDROPPER.BH.  NOTE: on 20060822, it
was determined that TROJ_MDROPPER.BH was exploiting CVE-2006-0009, so
this is not a new vulnerability.
