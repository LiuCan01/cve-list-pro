Microsoft Windows XP SP1 and SP2 before August 2004, and possibly
other operating systems and versions, uses insecure default ACLs that
allow the Authenticated Users group to gain privileges by modifying
critical configuration information for the (1) Simple Service
Discovery Protocol (SSDP), (2) Universal Plug and Play Device Host
(UPnP), (3) NetBT, (4) SCardSvr, (5) DHCP, and (6) DnsCache services,
aka "Permissive Windows Services DACLs."  NOTE: the NetBT, SCardSvr,
DHCP, DnsCache already require privileged access to exploit.
