SQL injection vulnerability in php121language.php in PHP121 1.4 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and execute
arbitrary code via the sess_username variable, as set by the php121un
HTTP COOKIE parameter, which is used in multiple files including
php121login.php.  NOTE: the code execution occurs because the SQL
query results are used in an include statement.
