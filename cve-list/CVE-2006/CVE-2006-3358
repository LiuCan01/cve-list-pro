Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in index.php in
NewsPHP 2006 PRO allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via the (1) words, (2) id, (3) cat_id, and (4) tim parameters,
which are not sanitized before being returned in an error page.  NOTE:
it is possible that some of these vectors are resultant from an SQL
injection issue.
