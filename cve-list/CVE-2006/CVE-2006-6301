DenyHosts 2.5 does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows
remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file
and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the
sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a login name
containing certain strings with an IP address, which is not properly
handled by a regular expression.
