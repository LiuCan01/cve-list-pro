The SMTP service of MailEnable Standard 1.92 and earlier, Professional
2.0 and earlier, and Enterprise 2.0 and earlier before the MESMTPC
hotfix, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a HELO command with a null byte in the
argument, possibly triggering a length inconsistency or a missing
argument.
