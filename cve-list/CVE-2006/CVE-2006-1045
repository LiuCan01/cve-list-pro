The HTML rendering engine in Mozilla Thunderbird 1.5, when "Block
loading of remote images in mail messages" is enabled, does not
properly block external images from inline HTML attachments, which
could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, such as
application version or IP address, when the user reads the email and
the external image is accessed.
