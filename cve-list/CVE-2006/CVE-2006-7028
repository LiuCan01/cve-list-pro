Single CPU Sun systems running Solaris 7, 8, or 9, such as Netra,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (console hang)
via a flood of small TCP/IP packets.  NOTE: this issue has not been
replicated by third parties. In addition, the cause is unknown,
although it might be related to "jabber" and generation of a large
amount of interrupts within the console, or a hardware error.
