SQL injection vulnerability in rss.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard)
1.1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
the comma parameter.  NOTE: it is not clear from the original report
how this attack can succeed, since the demonstration URL uses a
variable that is overwritten with static data in the extracted source
code.
