phpBB 2.0.20 does not properly verify user-specified input variables
used as limits to SQL queries, which allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via a negative LIMIT specification, as
demonstrated by the start parameter to memberlist.php, which reveals
the SQL query in the resulting error message.
