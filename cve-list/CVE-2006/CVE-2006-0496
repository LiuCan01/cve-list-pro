Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mozilla 1.7.12 and
possibly earlier, Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and possibly earlier, and
Netscape 8.1 and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the -moz-binding (Cascading Style
Sheets) CSS property, which does not require that the style sheet have
the same origin as the web page, as demonstrated by the compromise of
a large number of LiveJournal accounts.
