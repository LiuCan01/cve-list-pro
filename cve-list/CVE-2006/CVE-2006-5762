PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in forgot_pass.php in Free
File Hosting 1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the AD_BODY_TEMP parameter.  NOTE:
this issue was later reported for the "File Upload System" which is a
component of Free File Hosting.  This also affects Free Image Hosting
2.0, which contains the same code.
