Absolute path directory traversal vulnerability in (1) MERAK Mail Server for
Windows 8.3.8r with before IceWarp Web Mail 5.6.1 and (2) VisNetic MailServer
before 8.5.0.5 allows remote authenticated users to include arbitrary files
via a modified language parameter and a full Windows or UNC pathname in the
lang_settings parameter to mail/index.html, which is not properly sanitized
by the validatefolder PHP function, possibly due to an incomplete fix for
CVE-2005-4558.
