Simpliciti Locked Browser does not properly limit a user's actions to
ones within the intended Internet Explorer environment, which allows
local users to perform unauthorized actions by visiting a web site
that executes a JavaScript window.blur loop to remove focus from the
browser window, then pressing CTRL-SHIFT-ESC to invoke the Task
Manager.
