** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in addnews.php in Greg
Neustaetter gCards 1.13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
PHP code via a URL in the languagefile parameter.  NOTE: another
researcher has observed that languageFile is defined before use.  CVE
analysis as of 20061012 concurs with the dispute.
