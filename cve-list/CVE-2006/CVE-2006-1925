Directory traversal vulnerability in the editnews module
(inc/editnews.mdu) in index.php in CuteNews 1.4.1 allows remote
attackers to read or modify files via the source parameter in the (1)
editnews or (2) doeditnews action.  NOTE: this can also produce
resultant XSS when the target file does not exist.
