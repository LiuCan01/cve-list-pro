Directory traversal vulnerability in lang.php in Rama CMS 0.68 and
earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to
include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the
lang cookie, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache
HTTP Server log file, which is then included by lang.php.
