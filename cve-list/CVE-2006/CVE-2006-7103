Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in EZOnlineGallery 1.3
and earlier, and possibly other versions before 1.3.2 Beta, allow
remote attackers to (1) determine directory existence via a ".." in
the album parameter in a show_album action to (a) ezgallery.php, which
produces different responses depending on existence; and read
arbitrary image files via a ".." in the album or (2) image parameter
to (b) image.php.
