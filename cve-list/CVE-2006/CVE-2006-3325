client/cl_parse.c in the id3 Quake 3 Engine 1.32c and the Icculus
Quake 3 Engine (ioquake3) revision 810 and earlier allows remote
malicious servers to overwrite arbitrary write-protected cvars
variables on the client, such as cl_allowdownload for Automatic
Downloading and fs_homepath for the quake3 path, via a string of cvar
names and values sent from the server.  NOTE: this can be combined with
another vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files.
