** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in Description.php in Softerra
PHP Developer Library 1.5.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via the lib_dir parameter.  NOTE: this
issue is disputed by CVE as of 20061023, since there is no
Description.php file included in the product, and the existing
"Description" file contains documentation, not functioning code.
