Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in MKPortal 1.0.1 Final
allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files
via directory traversal sequences in the language cookie, as
demonstrated by using a gl_session cookie to inject PHP sequences into
the error.log file, which is then included by index.php with malicious
commands accessible by the ind parameter.
