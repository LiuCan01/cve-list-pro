The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) for Asterisk 1.2.x before 1.2.9
and 1.0.x before 1.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via truncated IAX 2 (IAX2)
video frames, which bypasses a length check and leads to a buffer
overflow involving negative length check.  NOTE: the vendor advisory
claims that only a DoS is possible, but the original researcher is
reliable.
