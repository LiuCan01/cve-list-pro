** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in functions/plugin.php in
SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals is enabled and
magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the plugins array parameter.  NOTE:
this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that
Squirrelmail provides prominent warnings to the administrator when
register_globals is enabled.  Since the varieties of administrator
negligence are uncountable, perhaps this type of issue should not be
included in CVE.  However, the original developer has posted a
security advisory, so there might be relevant real-world environments
under which this vulnerability is applicable.
