** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
libraries/amfphp/amf-core/custom/CachedGateway.php in Adobe PHP SDK
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the
AMFPHP_BASE parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a
third-party researcher who states that AMFPHP_BASE is a constant.
