Interpretation conflict in PostNuke 0.761 and earlier allows remote
attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via HTML tags
with a trailing "<" character, which is interpreted as a ">" character
by some web browsers but bypasses the blacklist protection in (1) the
pnVarCleanFromInput function in pnAPI.php, (2) the pnSecureInput
function in pnAntiCracker.php, and (3) the htmltext parameter in an
edituser operation to user.php.
