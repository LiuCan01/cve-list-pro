Buffer overflow in the DNS Client service in Microsoft Windows 2000
SP4, XP SP1 and SP2, and Server 2003 SP1 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted record response.  NOTE: while
MS06-041 implies that there is a single issue, there are multiple
vectors, and likely multiple vulnerabilities, related to (1) a
heap-based buffer overflow in a DNS server response to the client, (2)
a DNS server response with malformed ATMA records, and (3) a length
miscalculation in TXT, HINFO, X25, and ISDN records.
