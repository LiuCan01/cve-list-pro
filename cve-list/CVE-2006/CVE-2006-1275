GGZ Gaming Zone 0.0.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (client disconnect) via inputs that produce malformed XML,
including (1) trailing ' (apostrophe) character on the ID attribute in
a PLAYER XML tag, (2) joining with a long ID attribute or non-trailing
' characters, which causes a <none> name to be assigned, and then
disconnecting, or (3) a long CDATA message attribute, which prevents
closing tags from being added to the string.
