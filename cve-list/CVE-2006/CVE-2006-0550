Buffer overflow in an unspecified Oracle Client utility might allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service.  NOTE: due to the lack of relevant details from the Oracle
advisory, a separate CVE is being created since it cannot be
conclusively proven that this issue has been addressed by Oracle.  It
is possible that this is the same issue as Oracle Vuln# DBC02 from the
January 2006 CPU, in which case this would be a duplicate of
CVE-2006-0283.  However, there are enough inconsistencies that the
mapping can not be made authoritatively.
