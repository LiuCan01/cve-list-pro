** DISPUTED **

Kwik-Pay Payroll 4.2.20, and possibly other versions, stores the
KwikPay.mdb database file with insecure permissions, which allows
local users to obtain sensitive information such as employment and
payment data.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown;
the details are obtained solely from third party information.  NOTE:
the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, stating that "The
kwikpay.mdb file supplied with kwikpay is a template for the database
structure of user databases created by kwikpay and to store a
demonstration payroll. It does not contain any sensitive user
information.  When a user payroll database is opened, the encryption
of the database is checked and if the database is not encrypted, the
user is prompted to encrypt the database, but the choice is the
customers."
