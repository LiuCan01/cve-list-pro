SSH Tectia Management Agent 2.1.2 allows local users to gain root
privileges by running a program called sshd, which is obtained from a
process listing when the "Restart" action is selected from the
Management server GUI, which causes the agent to locate the pathname
of the user's program and restart it with root privileges.
