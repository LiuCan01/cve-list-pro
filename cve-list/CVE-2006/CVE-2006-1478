Directory traversal vulnerability in (1) initiate.php and (2) possibly
other PHP scripts in Turnkey Web Tools PHP Live Helper 1.8, and
possibly later versions, allows remote authenticated users to include
and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in
the language cookie, as demonstrated by uploading PHP code in a
gl_session cookie to users.php, which causes the code to be stored in
error.log, which is then included by initiate.php.
