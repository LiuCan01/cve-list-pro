Race condition in Linux kernel 2.6.15 to 2.6.17, when running on SMP
platforms, allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by
creating and exiting a large number of tasks, then accessing the /proc
entry of a task that is exiting, which causes memory corruption that
leads to a failure in the prune_dcache function or a BUG_ON error in
include/linux/list.h.
