Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Two Shoes
M-Factory (TSMF) SimpleBoard 1.1.0 Stable (aka com_simpleboard), as
used in Mambo and Joomla!, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via (1) the Name field in "post ne topic" in the
Frontend, (2) the Title (aka Community-Title) field in Simpleboard
Configuration in the Backend Admin Panel, and the (3) Name (aka
Forum-Title) and (4) Name (aka Category-Title) fields in Simpleboard
Administration in the Backend Admin Panel.  NOTE: some sources have
stated that the sb_authorname parameter is affected, but it is unclear
which field is related to it.
