** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in contxtd.class.php in the
Contacts XTD (ContXTD) component for Mambo (com_contxtd) allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: another researcher has
disputed this issue, saying that the software prevents the attack by
checking whether _VALID_MOS is defined.
