Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Snipe Gallery
3.1.4 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the (1) gallery_id parameter in view.php, (2)
keyword parameter in search.php, and (3) image_id parameter in
image.php.  NOTE: it is possible that vectors 1 and 3 are resultant
from SQL injection.
