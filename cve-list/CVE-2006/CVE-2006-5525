Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in mainfile.php in PHP-Nuke 7.9 and
earlier allows remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via
(1) "/**/UNION " or (2) " UNION/**/" sequences, which are not rejected
by the protection mechanism, as demonstrated by a SQL injection via
the eid parameter in a search action in the Encyclopedia module in
modules.php.
