Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in contact.html.php in the
Contact (com_contact) component in Limbo (aka Lite Mambo) CMS 1.0.4.2L
and earlier allows remote attackers to upload PHP code to the
images/contact folder via a filename with a double extension in the
contact_attach parameter in a contact option in index.php, which
bypasses an insufficiently restrictive regular expression.
