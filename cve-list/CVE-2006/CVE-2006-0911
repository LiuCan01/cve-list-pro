NmService.exe in Ipswitch WhatsUp Professional 2006 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted
requests to Login.asp, possibly involving the (1) "In]" and (2)
"b;tnLogIn" parameters, or (3) malformed btnLogIn parameters, possibly
involving missing "[" (open bracket) or "[" (closing bracket)
characters, as demonstrated by "&btnLogIn=[Log&In]=&" or
"&b;tnLogIn=[Log&In]=&" in the URL.  NOTE: due to the lack of
diagnosis by the original researcher, the precise nature of the
vulnerability is unclear.
