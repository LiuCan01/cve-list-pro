mshtml.dll 6.00.2900.2873, as used in Microsoft Internet Explorer,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
nested OBJECT tags, which trigger invalid pointer dereferences
including NULL dereferences.  NOTE: the possibility of code execution
was originally theorized, but Microsoft has stated that this issue is
non-exploitable.
