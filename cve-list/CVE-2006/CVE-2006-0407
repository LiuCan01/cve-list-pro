Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in post.php in AZ Bulletin
Board (AZbb) 1.1.00 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) nickname parameter and (2) an
iframe tag in the topic parameter.  NOTE: the original disclosure
specified the name parameter, but a correction was later provided.
NOTE: followup posts have both disputed and confirmed the original
claim.
