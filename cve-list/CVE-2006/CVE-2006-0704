iE Integrator 4.4.220114, when configured without a "bespoke error
page" in acm.ini, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via a URL that calls a non-existent .aspx script in the
integrator/apps directory, which results in an error message that
displays the installation path, web server name, IP, and port, session
cookie information, and the IIS system username.
