** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in enduser/listmessenger.php
in ListMessenger 0.9.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
PHP code via a URL in the lm_path parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has
disputed this issue to SecurityTracker, stating that the $lm_path
variable is set to a constant value.  As of 20060726, CVE concurs with
the vendor based on SecurityTracker's post-disclosure analysis.
