phpGraphy before 0.9.13a does not properly unset variables when the
input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an
alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a config.php file via the
pictures[] parameter to index.php.  NOTE: it could be argued that this
vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017)
and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be
treated as a vulnerability in phpGraphy.
