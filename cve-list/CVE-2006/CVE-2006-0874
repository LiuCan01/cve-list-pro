Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Intensive Point iUser
Ecommerce before 2.2 have unspecified vectors and impact, as addressed
by "Urgent secure fixes".  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of
CVE-2006-0854, but the vendor announcement for this issue (from
January 8, 2005) is too vague to be sure, and CVE-2006-0854 does not
provide version information.
