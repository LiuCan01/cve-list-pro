** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in net2ftp,
possibly 0.1 through 0.62, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the application_rootdir parameter.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party researcher, CVE,
and the vendor.  The vendor says "the variable is set in
settings.inc.php, so this is not a vulnerability."
