WebCore in Apple Mac OS X 10.3.9 and 10.4 through 10.4.7 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via crafted HTML that triggers a "memory management
error" in WebKit, possibly due to a buffer overflow, as originally
reported for the KHTMLParser::popOneBlock function in Apple Safari
2.0.4 using Javascript that changes document.body.innerHTML within a
DIV tag.
