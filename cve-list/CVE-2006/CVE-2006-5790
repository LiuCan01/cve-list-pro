Multiple format string vulnerabilities in elogd.c in ELOG 2.6.2 and
earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) an entry with an
attachment whose name contains format string specifiers (el_submit
function), and possibly other vectors in the (2) receive_config, (3)
show_rss_feed, (4) show_elog_list, (5) show_logbook_node, and (6)
server_loop functions.
