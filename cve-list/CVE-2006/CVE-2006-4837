Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in DCP-Portal SE
6.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the root parameter in (1) library/lib.php and (2)
library/editor/editor.php.  NOTE: the same primary issue can be used
for full path disclosure with an invalid parameter that reveals the
installation path in an error message.
