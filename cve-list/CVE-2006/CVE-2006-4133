Heap-based buffer overflow in SAP Internet Graphics Service (IGS) 6.40
and earlier, and 7.00 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via an HTTP
request with an ADM:GETLOGFILE command and a long portwatcher
argument, which triggers the overflow during error message
construction when the _snprintf function returns a negative value that
is used in a memcpy operation.
