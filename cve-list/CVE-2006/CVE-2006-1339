Directory traversal vulnerability in inc/functions.inc.php in CuteNews
1.4.1 and possibly other versions, when register_globals is enabled,
allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot)
sequence and trailing NULL (%00) byte in the archive parameter in an
HTTP POST or COOKIE request, which bypasses a sanity check that is
only applied to a GET request.
