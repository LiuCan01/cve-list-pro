The Graphics Rendering Engine in Microsoft Windows 2000 through 2000
SP4 and Windows XP through SP2 maps GDI Kernel structures on a global
shared memory section that is mapped with read-only permissions, but
can be remapped by other processes as read-write, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) and
gain privileges by modifying the kernel structures.
