Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Open Solution
Quick.Cart 2.0, when register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc
is disabled, allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
local files via a .. (dot dot) in the config[db_type] parameter to (1)
categories.php, (2) couriers.php, (3) orders.php, and (4) products.php
in actions_admin/; and (5) orders.php and (6) products.php in
actions_client/; as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an
Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by one of these
PHP scripts.
