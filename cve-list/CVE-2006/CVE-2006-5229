OpenSSH portable 4.1 on SUSE Linux, and possibly other platforms and
versions, and possibly under limited configurations, allows remote
attackers to determine valid usernames via timing discrepancies in
which responses take longer for valid usernames than invalid ones, as
demonstrated by sshtime.  NOTE: as of 20061014, it appears that this
issue is dependent on the use of manually-set passwords that causes
delays when processing /etc/shadow due to an increased number of
rounds.
