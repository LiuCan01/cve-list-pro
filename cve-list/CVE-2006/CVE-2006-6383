PHP 5.2.0 and 4.4 allows local users to bypass safe_mode and
open_basedir restrictions via a malicious path and a null byte before
a ";" in a session_save_path argument, followed by an allowed path,
which causes a parsing inconsistency in which PHP validates the
allowed path but sets session.save_path to the malicious path.
