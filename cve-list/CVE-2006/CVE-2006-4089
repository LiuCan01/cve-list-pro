Multiple buffer overflows in Andy Lo-A-Foe AlsaPlayer 0.99.76 and
earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash), or have other unknown impact, via (1) a long
Location field sent by a web server, which triggers an overflow in the
reconnect function in reader/http/http.c; (2) a long URL sent by a web
server when AlsaPlayer is seeking a media file for the playlist, which
triggers overflows in new_list_item and CbUpdated in
interface/gtk/PlaylistWindow.cpp; and (3) a long response sent by a
CDDB server, which triggers an overflow in cddb_lookup in
input/ccda/cdda_engine.c.
