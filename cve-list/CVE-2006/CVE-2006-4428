** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in Jupiter CMS
1.1.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL
in the template parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this claim, since the
$template variable is defined as a static value before it is
referenced in an include statement.
