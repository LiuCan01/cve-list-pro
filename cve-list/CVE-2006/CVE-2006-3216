Clearswift MAILsweeper for SMTP before 4.3.20 and MAILsweeper for
Exchange before 4.3.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service via (1) non-ASCII characters in a reverse DNS lookup result
from a Received header, which leads to a Receiver service stop, and
(2) unspecified vectors involving malformed messages, which causes
"unpredictable behavior" that prevents the Security service from
processing more messages.
