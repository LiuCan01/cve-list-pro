CRE Loaded 6.15 allows remote attackers to perform privileged actions,
including uploading and creating arbitrary files, via a direct request
to files.php.  NOTE: the vendor states "The initial announcement of
this risk was made on our website... and it included a patch which
will close the vulnerability on all known 6.0x and 6.1x releases.  We
strongly encourage users of CRE Loaded 6.x, osCMax, and other users
of osCommerce who have installed HTMLArea based WYSIWYG editors and
Admin Access with Levels to modify thier installations at the earliest
possible moment."
