Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 allows
user-assisted attackers to cause memory corruption via a crafted
PowerPoint file, which triggers the corruption when the file is
closed.  NOTE: due to the lack of available details as of 20060717, it
is unclear how this is related to CVE-2006-3655, CVE-2006-3660, and
CVE-2006-3590, although it is possible that they are all different.
