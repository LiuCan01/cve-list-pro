Woltlab Burning Board (wBB) Lite 1.0.2 does not properly unset
variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a
value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the wbb_userid
parameter to the top-level URI.  NOTE: it could be argued that this
vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017)
and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be
treated as a vulnerability in wBB Lite.
