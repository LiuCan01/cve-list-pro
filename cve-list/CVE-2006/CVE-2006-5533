Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in AROUNDMe 0.6.9,
and possibly earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the templatePath
parameter in template/barnraiser_01/pol_view.tpl.php and other
unspecified PHP scripts, a different vector than CVE-2006-5401.
