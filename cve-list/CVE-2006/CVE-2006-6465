** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in WBmap.php in WikyBlog 1.3.2 and
earlier allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local
files via directory traversal sequences in the l parameter.  NOTE: CVE
disputes this vulnerability because l is validated by ctype_alpha
before use.
