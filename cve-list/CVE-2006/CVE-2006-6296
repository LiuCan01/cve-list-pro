The RpcGetPrinterData function in the Print Spooler (spoolsv.exe)
service in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 and earlier, and possibly
Windows XP SP1 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (memory consumption) via an RPC request that specifies a
large 'offered' value (output buffer size), a variant of
CVE-2005-3644.
