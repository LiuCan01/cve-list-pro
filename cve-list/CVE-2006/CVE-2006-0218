Phase: Assigned (20060116)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:http://community.mybboard.net/showthread.php?tid=5852

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in MyBulletinBoard (MyBB) before
1.0.2 have unspecified impact and attack vectors, related to (1)
admin/moderate.php, (2) admin/themes.php, (3) inc/functions.php, (4)
inc/functions_upload.php, (5) printthread.php, and (6) usercp.php, and
probably related to SQL injection.  NOTE: it is likely that this issue
subsumes CVE-2005-4602 and CVE-2005-4603.  However, since the vendor
advisory is vague and additional files are mentioned, is is likely
that this contains at least one distinct vulnerability from
CVE-2005-4602 and CVE-2005-4603.
