Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in Kailash Nadh boastMachine
(formerly bMachine) 3.1 and earlier allows remote authenticated
administrators to bypass SQL injection protection mechanisms by using
commas, quote characters, pound sign (#) characters, "UNION," and
"SELECT," which are not filtered by the product, which only checks for
"insert," "delete," "update," and "replace."
