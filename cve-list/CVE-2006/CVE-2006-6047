Directory traversal vulnerability in manager/index.php in Etomite
0.6.1.2 allows remote authenticated administrators to include and
execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the f parameter,
as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server
log file, which is then included by index.php.
