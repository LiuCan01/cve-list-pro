The "Add Sender to Address Book" operation
(AddSenderToAddressBook.lss) and NameHelper.lss in IBM Lotus Notes 6.0
and 6.5 before 20060331 do not properly store information in the
Personal Address Book when multiple messages are checked and a message
uses AltFrom, which might allow user-assisted remote attackers to
trick a user into sending e-mail to an unauthorized recipient.
