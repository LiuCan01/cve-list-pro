** DISPUTED **

The proxy DNS service in Symantec Gateway Security (SGS) allows remote
attackers to make arbitrary DNS queries to third-party DNS servers,
while hiding the source IP address of the attacker.  NOTE: another
researcher has stated that the default configuration does not proxy
DNS queries received on the external interface.
