** DISPUTED **

EMC VMware Player allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of
service (unrecoverable application failure) via a long value of the
ide1:0.fileName parameter in the .vmx file of a virtual machine.  NOTE:
third parties have disputed this issue, saying that write access to
the .vmx file enables other ways of stopping the virtual machine, so
no privilege boundaries are crossed.
