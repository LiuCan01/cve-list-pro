** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in archive.asp in GA's Forum
Light allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the
(1) Forum and (2) pages parameter.  NOTE: SecurityTracker says that
the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that GA Forum Light does
not use an SQL database.  SecurityTracker's research indicates that
the original problem could be due to a vbscript parsing error based on
invalid arguments.
