index.php in WordPress 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information, such as SQL table prefixes, via an invalid
paged parameter, which displays the information in an SQL error
message.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party who
states that the issue does not leak any target-specific information.
