Coppermine Photo Gallery (CPG) 1.4.8 stable, with register_globals
enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass XSS protection and set
arbitrary variables via a query string that causes the variable to be
defined in global space, with separate _GET, _REQUEST, or other
critical parameters, which are unset by the protection scheme and
prevent the original variable from being detected.
