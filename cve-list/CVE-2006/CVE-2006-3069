** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in DoubleSpeak 0.1, when
register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via the config[private] parameter in multiple
files, as demonstrated by (1) index.php, (2) faq.php, and (3)
hardware.php. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by multiple
third-party researchers, who state that config[private] is initialized
in an include file before being used.
