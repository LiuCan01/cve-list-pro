** DISPUTED **

Firefox 1.5.0.7 on Kubuntu Linux allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) via a long URL in an A tag.  NOTE: this issue
has been disputed by several vendors, who could not reproduce the
report. In addition, the scope of the impact - system freeze -
suggests an issue that is not related to Firefox. Due to this impact,
CVE concurs with the dispute.
