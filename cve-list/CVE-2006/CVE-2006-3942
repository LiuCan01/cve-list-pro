The server driver (srv.sys) in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and
Server 2003 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) via an SMB_COM_TRANSACTION SMB message that contains a
string without null character termination, which leads to a NULL
dereference in the ExecuteTransaction function, possibly related to an
"SMB PIPE," aka the "Mailslot DOS" vulnerability.  NOTE: the name
"Mailslot DOS" was derived from incomplete initial research; the
vulnerability is not associated with a mailslot.
