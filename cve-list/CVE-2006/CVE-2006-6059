Buffer overflow in MA521nd5.SYS driver 5.148.724.2003 for NetGear
MA521 PCMCIA adapter allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code

supported rates information element.  NOTE: this issue was reported as
a "memory corruption" error, but the associated exploit code suggests
that it is a buffer overflow.
