The Execute method in the ADODB.Connection 2.7 and 2.8 ActiveX control
objects (ADODB.Connection.2.7 and ADODB.Connection.2.8) in the
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5 SP3, 2.7 SP1, 2.8, and 2.8
SP1 does not properly track freed memory when the second argument is a
BSTR, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(Internet Explorer crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
certain strings in the second and third arguments.
