The Motorola PEBL U6 08.83.76R, the Motorola V600, and possibly the
Motorola E398 and other Motorola P2K-based phones does not require
pairing for a connection related to the Headset Audio Gateway service,
which allows user-assisted remote attackers to obtain AT level access
and view phonebook entries and saved SMS messages by connecting on
Bluetooth channel 3 and tricking the user into pressing Grant, aka a
"Blueline" attack.  NOTE: while user-assisted, the attack is made
more feasible because of a GUI misrepresentation issue that allows a
default message to be replaced by an attacker-specified one.
