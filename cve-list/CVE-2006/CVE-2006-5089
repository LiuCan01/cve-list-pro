** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in mybic_server.php in Jim
Plush My-BIC 0.6.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the file parameter.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained from third party
information. CVE disputes this vulnerability because the file variable
is defined before use in a way that prevents arbitrary inclusion.
