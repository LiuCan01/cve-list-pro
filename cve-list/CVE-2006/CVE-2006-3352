** DISPUTED **

Cross-domain vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox allows remote attackers
to access restricted information from other domains via an object tag
with a data parameter that references a link on the attacker's
originating site that specifies a Location HTTP header that references
the target site, which then makes that content available through the
outerHTML attribute of the object.  NOTE: this description was based on
a report that has since been retracted by the original authors. The
authors misinterpreted their test results. Other third parties also
disputed the original report. Therefore, this is not a vulnerability.
It is being assigned a candidate number to provide a clear indication
of its status.
