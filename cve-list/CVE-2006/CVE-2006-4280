** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in anjel.index.php in ANJEL
(formerly MaMML) Component (com_anjel) for Mambo allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
by a third party, who says that $mosConfig_absolute_path is set in a
configuration file.
