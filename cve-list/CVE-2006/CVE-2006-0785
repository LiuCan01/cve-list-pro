Absolute path traversal vulnerability in include.php in PHPKIT 1.6.1
Release 2 and earlier allows remote attackers to include and execute
arbitrary local files via a direct request with a path parameter with
a null character and beginning with (1) '/' (slash) for an absolute
pathname or (2) a drive letter (such as "C:"), which bypasses checks
for ".." sequences and trailing ".php" extensions.
