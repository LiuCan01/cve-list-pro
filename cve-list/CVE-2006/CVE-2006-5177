The NTLM authentication in MailEnable Professional 2.0 and Enterprise
2.0 allows remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary code via
unspecified vectors involving crafted base64 encoded NTLM Type 3
messages, or (2) cause a denial of service via crafted base64 encoded
NTLM Type 1 messages, which trigger a buffer over-read.
