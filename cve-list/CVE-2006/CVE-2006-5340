Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Spatial component in
Oracle Database 8.1.7.4, 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.8, 10.1.0.5, and 10.2.0.2 have
unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors related to (1)
mdsys.sdo_lrs, aka Vuln# DB13, and (2) Vuln# DB17.  NOTE: as of
20061023, Oracle has not disputed reports from reliable third parties
that DB13 is related to bypassing input validation for SQL injection
related to convert_to_lrs_layer and dbms_assert, and DB17 is related
to SQL injection in the trigger in the SDO_DROP_USER package.
