Memory leak in the push_align function in src/util.c in Vilistextum
before 2.6.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory consumption) via unspecified vectors related to the tmp_align
variable.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this is a vulnerability, due
to the functionality of the product.
