PostgreSQL 8.1.x before 8.1.4, 8.0.x before 8.0.8, 7.4.x before
7.4.13, 7.3.x before 7.3.15, and earlier versions allows
context-dependent attackers to bypass SQL injection protection methods
in applications that use multibyte encodings that allow the ""
(backslash) byte 0x5c to be the trailing byte of a multibyte
character, such as SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC, which cannot be
handled correctly by a client that does not understand multibyte
encodings, aka a second variant of "Encoding-Based SQL Injection."
NOTE: it could be argued that this is a class of issue related to
interaction errors between the client and PostgreSQL, but a CVE has
been assigned since PostgreSQL is treating this as a preventative
measure against this class of problem.
