Apple QuickTime 7.1.3 Player and Plug-In allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary JavaScript code and possibly conduct other attacks
via a QuickTime Media Link (QTL) file with an embed XML element and a
qtnext parameter that identifies resources outside of the original
domain.  NOTE: as of 20070912, this issue has been demonstrated by
using instances of Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile and
Components.interfaces.nsIProcess to execute arbitrary local files
within Firefox and possibly Internet Explorer.
