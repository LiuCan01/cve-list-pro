Pixelpost 1.5 beta 1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain
configuration information via a direct request to
includes/phpinfo.php, which calls the phpinfo function.  NOTE: the
vendor has disputed some issues from the original disclosure, but due
to the vagueness of the dispute, it is not clear whether the vendor is
disputing this particular issue.
