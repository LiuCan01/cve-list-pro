Microsoft Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to spoof a
legitimate URL in the status bar and conduct a phishing attack via a
web page with an anchor element with a legitimate "href" attribute, a
form whose action points to a malicious URL, and an INPUT submit
element that is modified to look like a legitimate URL.  NOTE: this
issue is very similar to CVE-2004-1104, although the manipulations are
slightly different.
