Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Verosky Media Instant
Photo Gallery allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via the member parameter in a viewpro action in member.php.
NOTE: the original report may be inaccurate, since the "viewpro"
string does not appear in the source code for version 1.0.2 of the
product.
