Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/30165

bitweaver 1.3.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via a sort_mode=-98 query string to (1)
blogs/list_blogs.php, (2) fisheye/index.php, (3)
wiki/orphan_pages.php, or (4) wiki/list_pages.php, which forces a SQL
error.  NOTE: the fisheye/list_galleries.php vector is already covered
by CVE-2005-4380.
