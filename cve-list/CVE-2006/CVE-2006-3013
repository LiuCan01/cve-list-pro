Interpretation conflict in resetpw.php in phpBannerExchange before 2.0
Update 6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
an email parameter containing a null (%00) character after a valid
e-mail address, which passes the validation check in the eregi PHP
command.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a
bug in the eregi PHP command and the proper fix should be in PHP; if
so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in
phpBannerExchange.
