Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Kubix 0.7 and earlier
allow remote attackers to (1) include and execute arbitrary local
files via ".." sequences in the theme cookie to index.php, which is
not properly handled by includes/head.php; and (2) read arbitrary
files via ".." sequences in the file parameter in an add_dl action to
adm_index.php, as demonstrated by reading connect.php.
