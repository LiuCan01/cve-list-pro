Unspecified vulnerability in mso.dll in Microsoft PowerPoint 2003
allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted PowerPoint file.  NOTE: due to the lack of available details
as of 20060717, it is unclear how this is related to CVE-2006-3656,
CVE-2006-3660, and CVE-2006-3590, although it is possible that they
are all different.
