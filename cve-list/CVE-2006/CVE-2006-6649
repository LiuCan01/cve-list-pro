Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in display.php in HyperVM 1.2
and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via an encoded frm_action parameter.  NOTE: the vendor disputes
this issue, but it is not certain whether the dispute is about the
severity of the issue, or its existence.
