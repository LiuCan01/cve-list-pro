Intoto iGateway VPN and iGateway SSL-VPN allow context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via parasitic
public keys with large (1) "public exponent" or (2) "public modulus"
values in X.509 certificates that require extra time to process when
using RSA signature verification, a related issue to CVE-2006-2940.
