com.apple.AppleDiskImageController in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8, and
possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a malformed DMG image that triggers memory corruption.  NOTE:
the severity of this issue has been disputed by a third party, who
states that the impact is limited to a denial of service (kernel
panic) due to a vm_fault call with a non-aligned address.
