Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the parse_query_str
function in include/print.php in JSBoard 2.0.10 and 2.0.11, and
possibly other versions before 2.0.12, allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via parameters that are set as
global variables within the program, as demonstrated using the table
parameter to login.php.
