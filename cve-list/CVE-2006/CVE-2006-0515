Cisco PIX/ASA 7.1.x before 7.1(2) and 7.0.x before 7.0(5), PIX 6.3.x
before 6.3.5(112), and FWSM 2.3.x before 2.3(4) and 3.x before 3.1(7),
when used with Websense/N2H2, allows remote attackers to bypass HTTP
access restrictions by splitting the GET method of an HTTP request
into multiple packets, which prevents the request from being sent to
Websense for inspection, aka bugs CSCsc67612, CSCsc68472, and
CSCsd81734.
