SQL injection vulnerability in wwv_flow_utilities.gen_popup_list in
the WWV_FLOW_UTILITIES package for Oracle APEX/HTMLDB before 2.2
allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL by
modifying the P_LOV parameter and calculating a matching MD5 checksum
for the P_LOV_CHECKSUM parameter.  NOTE: it is likely that this issue
is subsumed by CVE-2006-5351, but due to lack of details from Oracle,
this cannot be proven.
