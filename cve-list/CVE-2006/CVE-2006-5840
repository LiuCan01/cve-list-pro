** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Abarcar Realty Portal allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) neid
parameter to newsdetails.php, or the (2) slid parameter to slistl.php.
NOTE: the cat vector is already covered by CVE-2006-2853.  NOTE: the
vendor has notified CVE that the current version only creates static
pages, and that slistl.php/slid never existed in any version.
