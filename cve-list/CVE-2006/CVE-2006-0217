Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Ultimate
Auction 3.67 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the (1) item parameter in item.pl and (2) category parameter
in itemlist.pl, which reflects the XSS in an error message. NOTE: the
affected version might be wrong since the current version as of
20060116 is 3.6.1.
