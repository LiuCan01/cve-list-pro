Bugzilla 2.20rc1 through 2.20 and 2.21.1, when using RSS 1.0, allows
remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a
title element with HTML encoded sequences such as "&gt;", which are
automatically decoded by some RSS readers.  NOTE: this issue is not in
Bugzilla itself, but rather due to design or documentation
inconsistencies within RSS, or implementation vulnerabilities in RSS
readers.  While this issue normally would not be included in CVE, it
is being identified since the Bugzilla developers have addressed it.
