Direct static code injection vulnerability in Ultimate PHP Board (UPB)
1.9.6 and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to
execute arbitrary PHP code via multiple unspecified "configuration
fields" in (1) admin_chatconfig.php, (2) admin_configcss.php, (3)
admin_config.php, or (4) admin_config2.php, which are stored as
configuration settings.  NOTE: this issue can be exploited by remote
attackers by leveraging other vulnerabilities in UPB.
