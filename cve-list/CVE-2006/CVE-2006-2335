Jelsoft vBulletin accepts uploads of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
processes them in a way that allows remote authenticated
administrators to gain shell access by uploading a CSS file that
contains PHP code, then selecting the file via the style chooser,
which causes the PHP code to be executed.  NOTE: the vendor was unable
to reproduce this issue in 3.5.x.  NOTE: this issue might be due to
direct static code injection.
