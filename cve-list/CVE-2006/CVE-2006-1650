Firefox 1.5.0.1 allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar and
possibly conduct phishing attacks by re-opening the window to a
malicious Shockwave Flash application, then changing the window
location back to a trusted URL while the Flash application is still
loading.  NOTE: a followup was unable to replicate this issue.
