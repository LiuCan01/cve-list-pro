** DISPUTED **
Directory traversal vulnerability in workspaces.php in phpXplorer
0.9.33 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a ..
(dot dot) and trailing null byte (%00) in the sShare parameter.  NOTE:
a followup post claims that this is not a vulnerability since the
functionality of phpXplorer supports the upload of PHP files, which
would not cross privilege boundaries since the PHP functionality would
support read access outside the web root.
