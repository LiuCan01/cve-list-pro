** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
admin/lib-maintenance.inc.php in phpAdsNew 2.0.4-pr2 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the phpAds_path
parameter, a different component than CVE-2006-3984.  NOTE: this issue
is disputed by CVE, since phpAds_path is used as a constant.
