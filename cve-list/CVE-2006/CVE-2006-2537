Reference: XF:bor-mod-file-format-string(26582)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26582

Multiple format string vulnerabilities in (a) OpenBOR 2.0046 and
earlier, (b) Beats of Rage (BOR) 1.0029 and earlier, and (c)
Horizontal Shooter BOR (HOR) 2.0000 and earlier allow remote attackers
to execute code via format string specifiers in configurations used in
various mod files, as demonstrated by the (1) music identifier in
data/scenes/intro.txt, which is not properly handled in the update
function, and (2) background identifier in data/easy/1aeasy.txt, which
is not properly handled in the shutdown function.
