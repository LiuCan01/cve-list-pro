Dynamic code evaluation vulnerability in tests/tmssql.php test script
in ADOdb for PHP before 4.70, as used in multiple products including
(1) Mantis, (2) PostNuke, (3) Moodle, (4) Cacti, (5) Xaraya, (6)
PhpOpenChat, possibly (7) MAXdev MD-Pro, and (8) Simplog, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP functions via the do
parameter, which is saved in a variable that is then executed as a
function, as demonstrated using phpinfo.
