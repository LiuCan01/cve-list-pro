SQL injection vulnerability in FlexCustomer 0.0.4 and earlier allows
remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the admin and ordinary user interface, probably involving
the (1) checkuser and (2) checkpass parameters to (a) admin/index.php,
and (3) username and (4) password parameters to (b) index.php.  NOTE:
it was later reported that 0.0.6 is also affected.
