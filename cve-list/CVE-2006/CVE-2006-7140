The libike library, as used by in.iked, elfsign, and kcfd in Sun
Solaris 9 and 10, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes
PKCS-1 padding before generating a hash, which allows remote attackers
to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and
prevents libike from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates
that use PKCS #1, a similar issue to CVE-2006-4339.
