Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in DeleGate 9.x before 9.0.6 and
8.x before 8.11.6 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
via crafted DNS responses messages that cause (1) a buffer over-read
or (2) infinite recursion, which can trigger a segmentation fault or
invalid memory access, as demonstrated by the OUSPG PROTOS DNS test
suite.
