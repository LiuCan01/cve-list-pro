enter.asp in Mini-Nuke 2.3 and earlier makes it easier for remote
attackers to conduct password guessing attacks by setting the guvenlik
parameter to the same value as the hidden gguvenlik parameter, which
bypasses a verification step because the gguvenlik parameter is
assumed to be immutable by the attacker.
