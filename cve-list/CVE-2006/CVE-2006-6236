Adobe Reader (Adobe Acrobat Reader) 7.0 through 7.0.8 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a long argument string to the (1) src, (2) setPageMode, (3)
setLayoutMode, and (4) setNamedDest methods in an AcroPDF ActiveX
control, a different set of vectors than CVE-2006-6027.
