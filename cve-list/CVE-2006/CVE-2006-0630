RITLabs The Bat! before 3.0.0.15 displays certain important headers
from encapsulated data in message/partial MIME messages, instead of
the real headers, which is in violation of RFC2046 header merging
rules and allows remote attackers to spoof the origin of e-mail by
sending a fragmented message, as demonstrated using spoofed Received:
and Message-ID: headers.
