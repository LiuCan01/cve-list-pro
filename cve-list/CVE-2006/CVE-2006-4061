** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in Thomas Pequet
phpPrintAnalyzer 1.1, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
rep_par_rapport_racine parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
by third party researchers, stating that the rep_par_rapport_racine
variable is initialized before use.
