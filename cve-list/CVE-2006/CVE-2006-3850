** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in upgrader.php in Vanilla CMS
1.0.1 and earlier, when /conf/old_settings.php exists, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the RootDirectory
parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party who
states that the RootDirectory parameter is initialized before being
used, for version 1.0.  CVE analysis concurs with the dispute, but it
is unclear whether older versions are affected.
