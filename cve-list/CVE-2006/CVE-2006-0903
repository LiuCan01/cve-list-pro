Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/24966

MySQL 5.0.18 and earlier allows local users to bypass logging
mechanisms via SQL queries that contain the NULL character, which are
not properly handled by the mysql_real_query function.  NOTE: this
issue was originally reported for the mysql_query function, but the
vendor states that since mysql_query expects a null character, this is
not an issue for mysql_query.
