Hawking Technology wireless router WR254-CA uses a hardcoded IP
address among the set of DNS server IP addresses, which could allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or hijack the router by
attacking or spoofing the server at the hardcoded address.  NOTE: it
could be argued that this issue reflects an inherent limitation of DNS
itself, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.
