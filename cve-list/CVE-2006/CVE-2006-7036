PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in register.php for Andys Chat
4.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the action
parameter.  NOTE: this issue was announced by an unreliable researcher,
but the vendor is no longer distributing the product, so the original
claims can not be evaluated.
