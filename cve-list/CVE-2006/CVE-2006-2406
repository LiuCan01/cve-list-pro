Directory traversal vulnerability in bb_lib/abbc.css.php in
Unclassified NewsBoard (UNB) 1.5.3-d and possibly earlier versions,
when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include
arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences and a trailing null byte
(%00) in the design_path parameter.  NOTE: this is closely related,
but a different vulnerability than the ABBC[Config][smileset]
parameter.
