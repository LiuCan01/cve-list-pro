The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in Avaya
VSU 100, 2000, 7500, 10000, and CSU 5000, when running IPSec, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via certain IKE
packets, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.
NOTE: due to the lack of details in the advisory, it is unclear which

applies to.
