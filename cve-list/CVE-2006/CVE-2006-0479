pmwiki.php in PmWiki 2.1 beta 20, with register_globals enabled,
allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that
deregister global variables by setting both a GPC variable and a
GLOBALS[] variable with the same name, which causes PmWiki to unset
the GLOBALS[] variable but not the GPC variable, which creates
resultant vulnerabilities such as remote file inclusion and cross-site
scripting (XSS).
