Interpretation conflict between Internet Explorer and other web
browsers such as Mozilla, Opera, and Firefox might allow remote
attackers to modify the visual presentation of web pages and possibly
bypass protection mechanisms such as content filters via ASCII
characters with the 8th bit set, which could be stripped by Internet
Explorer to render legible text, but not when using other browsers.
NOTE: there has been significant discussion about this issue, and as
of 20060625, it is not clear where the responsibility for this issue
lies, although it might be due to vagueness within the associated
standards.  NOTE: this might only be exploitable with certain
encodings.
