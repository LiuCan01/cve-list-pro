Apple Safari 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute code via an invalid FRAME tag, possibly
due to (1) multiple SCROLLING attributes with no values, or (2) a SRC
attribute with no value.  NOTE: due to lack of diagnosis by the
researcher, it is unclear which vector is responsible.
