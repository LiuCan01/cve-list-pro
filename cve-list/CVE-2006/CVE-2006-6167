** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in L. Brandon Stone
and Nathanial P. Hendler Active PHP Bookmarks (APB) 1.1.02 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
APB_SETTINGS['apb_path'] parameter in (1) apb_common.php or (2)
apb.php.  NOTE: CVE and another third party dispute this vulnerability
because these PHP scripts exit if the attack vectors are present in
GPC variables.
