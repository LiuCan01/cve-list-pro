** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ISPConfig 2.2.3
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
(1) go_info[isp][classes_root] parameter in (a) server.inc.php, and
the (2) go_info[server][classes_root] parameter in (b) app.inc.php,
(c) login.php, and (d) trylogin.php.  NOTE: this issue has been
disputed by the vendor, who states that the original researcher
"reviewed the installation tarball that is not identical with the
resulting system after installtion.  The file, where the $go_info
array is declared ... is created by the installer."
