Stack-based buffer overflow in the create_named_pipe function in
libmysql.c in PHP 4.3.10 and 4.4.x before 4.4.3 for Windows allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long (1) arg_host or (2)
arg_unix_socket argument, as demonstrated by a long named pipe
variable in the host argument to the mysql_connect function.
