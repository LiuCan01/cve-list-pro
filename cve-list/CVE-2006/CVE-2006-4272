** DISPUTED **

Jelsoft vBulletin 3.5.4 allows remote attackers to register multiple
arbitrary users and cause a denial of service (resource consumption)
via a large number of requests to register.php.  NOTE: the vendor has
disputed this vulnerability, stating "If you have the CAPTCHA enabled
then the registrations wont even go through. ...  if you are talking
about the flood being allowed in the first place then surely this is
something that should be handled at the server level."
