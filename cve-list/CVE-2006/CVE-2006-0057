Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, and 6 allows remote attackers
to bypass the Kill bit settings for dangerous ActiveX controls via
unknown vectors involving crafted HTML, which can expose the browser
to attacks that would otherwise be prevented by the Kill bit setting.
NOTE: CERT/CC claims that MS05-054 fixes this issue, but it is not
described in MS05-054.
