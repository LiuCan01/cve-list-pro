Heap-based buffer overflow in the IMA_SECURE_DecryptData1 function in
ImaSystem.dll for Citrix MetaFrame XP 1.0 and 2.0, and Presentation
Server 3.0 and 4.0, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via requests to the Independent Management Architecture (IMA) service
(ImaSrv.exe) with invalid size values that trigger the overflow during
decryption.
