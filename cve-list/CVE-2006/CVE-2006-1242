The ip_push_pending_frames function in Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x before
2.6.16 increments the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving
unsolicited TCP SYN-ACK packets, which allows remote attackers to
conduct an Idle Scan (nmap -sI) attack, which bypasses intended
protections against such attacks.
