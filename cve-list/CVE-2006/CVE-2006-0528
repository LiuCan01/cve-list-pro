The cairo library (libcairo), as used in GNOME Evolution and possibly
other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(persistent client crash) via an attached text file that contains
"Content-Disposition: inline" in the header, and a very long line in
the body, which causes the client to repeatedly crash until the e-mail
message is manually removed, possibly due to a buffer overflow, as
demonstrated using an XML attachment.
