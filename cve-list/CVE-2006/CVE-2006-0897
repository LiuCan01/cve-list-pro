** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in VCS Virtual Program Management Intranet
(VPMi) Enterprise 3.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the UpdateID0 parameter to Service_Requests.asp.  NOTE:
the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are
obtained solely from third party information.  NOTE: the vendor has
disputed this issue, saying that "[we] have a behind the scenes
complex state management system that uses a combination of keys placed
in JavaScript and Session State (server side) that protects against
the type of SQL injection you describe.  We have tested for many of
the cases and have not found it to be an issue."  Further
investigation suggests that the original researcher might have
triggered errors using invalid field values, which is not proof of SQL
injection; however, the vendor did not receive a response from the
original researcher.
