resmgrd in resmgr for SUSE Linux and other distributions does not
properly handle when access to a USB device is granted by using
"usb:<bus>,<dev>" notation, which grants access to all USB devices and
allows local users to bypass intended restrictions.  NOTE: this is a
different vulnerability than CVE-2005-4788.
