An unspecified "logical programming mistake" in SMART SynchronEyes
Student and Teacher 6.0, and possibly earlier versions, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service via a large packet to the
Teacher discovery port (UDP port 5496), which causes a thread to
terminate and prevents communications on that port.
