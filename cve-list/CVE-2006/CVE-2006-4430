The Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) 3.6.4.1 and earlier allows
remote attackers to prevent installation of the Cisco Clean Access
(CCA) Agent and bypass local and remote protection mechanisms by
modifying (1) the HTTP User-Agent header or (2) the behavior of the
TCP/IP stack.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed the severity of this
issue, stating that users cannot bypass authentication mechanisms.
