PHP-Fusion 6.00.306 and earlier, running under Apache HTTP Server
1.3.27 and PHP 4.3.3, allows remote authenticated users to upload
files of arbitrary types using a filename that contains two or more
extensions that ends in an assumed-valid extension such as .gif, which
bypasses the validation, as demonstrated by uploading then executing
an avatar file that ends in ".php.gif" and contains PHP code in EXIF
metadata.
