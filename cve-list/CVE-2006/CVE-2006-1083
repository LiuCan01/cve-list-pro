Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in PHP-Stats 0.1.9.1 and
earlier allow remote attackers to read and possibly execute arbitrary
files via a .. (dot dot) in the (1) option[language] and (2)
option[template] parameters, and (3) possibly other parameters, to (a)
admin.php and (b) other unspecified scripts.  NOTE: the
admin.php/option[language] vector can be used by remote
unauthenticated attackers to include arbitrary files in conjunction
with CVE-2006-1085.
