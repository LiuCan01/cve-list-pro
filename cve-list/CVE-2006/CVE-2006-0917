Melange Chat Server (aka M-Chat), when accessed via a web browser,
automatically sends cookies and other sensitive information for a
server to any port specified in the associated link, which allows
local users on that server to read the cookies from HTTP headers and
possibly gain sensitive information, such as credentials, by setting
up a listening port and reading the credentials when the victim clicks
on the link.
