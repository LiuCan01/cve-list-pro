Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Joomla! before 1.0.11, related
to "Injection Flaws," allow attackers to have an unknown impact via
(1) globals.php, which uses include_once() instead of require(); (2)
the $options variable; (3) Admin Upload Image; (4) ->load(); (5)
content submissions when frontpage is selected; (6) the mosPageNav
constructor; (7) saveOrder functions; (8) the absence of "exploit
blocking rules" in htaccess; and (9) the ACL.
