Global variable overwrite vulnerability in PHP-Nuke allows remote
attackers to conduct remote PHP file inclusion attacks via a modified
phpbb_root_path parameter to the admin scripts (1) index.php, (2)
admin_ug_auth.php, (3) admin_board.php, (4) admin_disallow.php, (5)
admin_forumauth.php, (6) admin_groups.php, (7) admin_ranks.php, (8)
admin_styles.php, (9) admin_user_ban.php, (10) admin_words.php, (11)
admin_avatar.php, (12) admin_db_utilities.php, (13)
admin_forum_prune.php, (14) admin_forums.php, (15)
admin_mass_email.php, (16) admin_smilies.php, (17) admin_ug_auth.php,
and (18) admin_users.php, which overwrites $phpbb_root_path when the
import_request_variables function is executed after $phpbb_root_path
has been initialized to a static value.
