Oracle Database Server 10g Release 2 allows local users to execute
arbitrary SQL queries via the GET_DOMAIN_INDEX_METADATA function in
the DBMS_EXPORT_EXTENSION package. NOTE: this issue was originally
linked to DB05 (CVE-2006-1870), but a reliable third party has claimed
that it is not the same issue. Based on details of the problem, the
primary issue appears to be insecure privileges that facilitate the
introduction of SQL in a way that is not related to special
characters, so this is not "SQL injection" per se.
