jscript.dll in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 and earlier allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via
a Shockwave Flash object that contains ActionScript code that calls
VBScript, which in turn calls the Javascript document.write function,
which triggers a null dereference.
