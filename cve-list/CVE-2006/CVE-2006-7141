** DISPUTED **

Absolute path traversal vulnerability in Oracle Database Server, when
utl_file_dir is set to a wildcard value or "CREATE ANY DIRECTORY to
PUBLIC" privileges exist, allows remote authenticated users to read
and modify arbitrary files via full filepaths to utl_file functions
such as (1) utl_file.put_line and (2) utl_file.get_line, a related
issue to CVE-2005-0701.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by third parties
who state that this is due to an insecure configuration instead of an
inherent vulnerability.
