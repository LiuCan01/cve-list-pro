McAfee Network Agent (mcnasvc.exe) 1.0.178.0, as used by multiple
McAfee products possibly including Internet Security Suite, Personal
Firewall Plus, and VirusScan, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (agent crash) via a long packet, possibly because of
an invalid string position field value.  NOTE: some of these details
are obtained from third party information.
