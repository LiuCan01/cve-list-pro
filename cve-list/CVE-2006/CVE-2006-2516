mainfile.php in XOOPS 2.0.13.2 and earlier, when register_globals is
enabled, allows remote attackers to overwrite variables such as
$xoopsOption['nocommon'] and conduct directory traversal attacks or
include PHP files via (1) xoopsConfig[language] to misc.php or (2)
xoopsConfig[theme_set] to index.php, as demonstrated by injecting PHP
sequences into a log file.
