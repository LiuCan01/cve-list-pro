MSO.DLL in Microsoft Office 2000, Office XP (2002), and Office 2003
allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service and
execute arbitrary code via multiple attack vectors, as originally
demonstrated using a crafted document record with a malformed string,
as demonstrated by replacing a certain "01 00 00 00" byte sequence
with an "FF FF FF FF" byte sequence, possibly causing an invalid array
index, in (1) an Excel .xls document, which triggers an access
violation in ole32.dll; (2) an Excel .xlw document, which triggers an
access violation in excel.exe; (3) a Word document, which triggers an
access violation in mso.dll in winword.exe; and (4) a PowerPoint
document, which triggers an access violation in powerpnt.txt.  NOTE:
after the initial disclosure, this issue was demonstrated by
triggering an integer overflow using an inconsistent size for a
Unicode "Sheet Name" string.
