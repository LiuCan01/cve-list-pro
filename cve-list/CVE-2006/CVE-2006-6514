Winamp Web Interface (Wawi) 7.5.13 and earlier uses an insufficient
comparison to determine whether a directory is located below the
application's root directory, which allows remote authenticated users
to access certain other directories if the name of the root directory
is a substring of the name of the target directory, as demonstrated by
accessing C:folder2 when the root directory is C:folder.
