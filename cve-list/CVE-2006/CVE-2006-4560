Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the browser's session
with an arbitrary intranet web server, by hosting script on an
Internet web server that can be made inaccessible by the attacker and
that has a domain name under the attacker's control, which can force
the browser to drop DNS pinning and perform a new DNS query for the
domain name after the script is already running.
