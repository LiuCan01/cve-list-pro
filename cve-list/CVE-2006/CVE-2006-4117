The squeue_drain function in Sun Solaris 10, possibly only when run on
CMT processors, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
("bad trap" and system panic) by opening and closing a large number of
TCP connections ("heavy TCP/IP loads").  NOTE: the original report
specifies the function name as "drain_squeue," but this is likely
incorrect.
