htpasswd, as used in Acme thttpd 2.25b and possibly other products
such as Apache, might allow local users to gain privileges via shell
metacharacters in a command line argument, which is used in a call to
the system function.  NOTE: since htpasswd is normally installed as a
non-setuid program, and the exploit is through command line options,
perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.  However, if there
are some typical or recommended configurations that use htpasswd with
sudo privileges, or common products that access htpasswd remotely,
then perhaps it should be included.
