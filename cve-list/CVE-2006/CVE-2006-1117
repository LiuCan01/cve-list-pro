nCipher firmware before V10, as used by (1) nShield, (2) nForce, (3)
netHSM, (4) payShield, (5) SecureDB, (6) DSE200 Document Sealing
Engine, (7) Time Source Master Clock (TSMC), and possibly other
products, contains certain options that were only intended for testing
and not production, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
information about encryption keys and crack those keys with less
effort than brute force.
