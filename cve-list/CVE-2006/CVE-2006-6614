The save_log_local function in Fully Automatic Installation (FAI)
2.10.1, and possibly 3.1.2, when verbose mode is enabled, stores the
root password hash in /var/log/fai/current/fai.log, whose file
permissions allow it to be copied to other hosts when fai-savelog is
called and allows attackers to obtain the hash.
