The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation
(isakmp_agg.c) in the Shoichi Sakane KAME Project racoon, as used by
NetBSD 1.6, 2.x before 20060119, certain FreeBSD releases, and
possibly other distributions of BSD or Linux operating systems, when
running in aggressive mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (daemon crash) via crafted IKE packets, as demonstrated by
the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.
