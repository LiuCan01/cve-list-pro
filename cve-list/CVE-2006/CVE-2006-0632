The gen_rand_string function in phpBB 2.0.19 uses insufficiently
random data (small value space) to create the activation key
("validation ID") that is sent by e-mail when establishing a password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the key and
modify passwords for existing accounts or create new accounts.
