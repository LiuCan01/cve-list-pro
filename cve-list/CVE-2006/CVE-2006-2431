Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 500 Internal Server
Error page on the SOAP port (8880/tcp) in IBM WebSphere Application
Server 5.0.2 and earlier, 5.1.x before 5.1.1.12, and 6.0.2 up to
6.0.2.7, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the URI, which is contained in a FAULTACTOR element on this
page.  NOTE: some sources have reported the element as "faultfactor,"
but this is likely erroneous.
