phpGraphy 0.9.11 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrator privileges via a direct request
to index.php with the editwelcome parameter set to 1, which can then
be used to modify the main page to inject arbitrary HTML and web
script.  NOTE: XSS attacks are resultant from this issue, since normal
functionality allows the admin to modify pages.
