Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 allows remote attackers to cause a
security certificate from a secure web site to appear invalid via a
link to res://ieframe.dll/invalidcert.htm with the target site as an
argument, which displays the site's URL in the address bar but causes
Internet Explorer to report that the certificate is invalid.
