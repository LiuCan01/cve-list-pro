The Security Framework in Apple Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.4.8 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption)
via certain public key values in an X.509 certificate that requires
extra resources during signature verification.  NOTE: this issue may be
similar to CVE-2006-2940.
