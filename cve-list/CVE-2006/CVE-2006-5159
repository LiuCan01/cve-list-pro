** DISPUTED **

Stack-based buffer overflow in Mozilla Firefox allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving
JavaScript.  NOTE: the vendor and original researchers have released a
follow-up comment disputing the severity of this issue, in which the
researcher states that "we mentioned that there was a previously known
Firefox vulnerability that could result in a stack overflow ending up
in remote code execution. However, the code we presented did not in
fact do this... I have not succeeded in making this code do anything
more than cause a crash and eat up system resources".
