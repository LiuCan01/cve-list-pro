earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via the id parameter in a request for the top-level URI.  NOTE: the id
parameter in index.php, and the type and show parameters in a top
action, are already covered by CVE-2006-1349; and the term parameter
in a search action is already covered by CVE-2006-1806.
