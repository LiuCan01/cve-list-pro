Buffer overflow in mshtml.dll in Microsoft Internet Explorer
6.0.2900.2180, and probably other versions, allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via an HTML tag with a large number of script
action handlers such as onload and onmouseover, as demonstrated using
onclick, aka the "Multiple Event Handler Memory Corruption
Vulnerability."
