The 802.11 wireless client in certain operating systems including
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 does not warn the
user when (1) it establishes an association with a station in ad hoc
(aka peer-to-peer) mode or (2) a station in ad hoc mode establishes an
association with it, which allows remote attackers to put unexpected
wireless communication into place.
