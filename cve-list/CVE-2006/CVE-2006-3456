The Symantec NAVOPTS.DLL ActiveX control (aka
Symantec.Norton.AntiVirus.NAVOptions) 12.2.0.13, as used in Norton
AntiVirus, Internet Security, and System Works 2005 and 2006, is
designed for use only in application-embedded web browsers, which
allows remote attackers to "crash the control" via unspecified vectors
related to content on a web site, and place Internet Explorer into a
"defunct state" in which remote attackers can execute arbitrary code
in addition to other Symantec ActiveX controls, regardless of whether
they are marked safe for scripting.  NOTE: this CVE was inadvertently
used for an E-mail Auto-Protect issue, but that issue has been
assigned CVE-2007-3771.
