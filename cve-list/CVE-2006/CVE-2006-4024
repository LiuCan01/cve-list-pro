The FESTAHES_Load function in pce/hes.c in Festalon 0.5.0 through
0.5.5 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative LoadAddr
value in a HES file, which is used as an offset in a memcpy operation
and leads to a buffer underflow.
