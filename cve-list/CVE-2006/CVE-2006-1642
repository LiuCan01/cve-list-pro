Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Interact 2.1.1 allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the
search_terms parameter to (a) search.php, and (2) the first_name, (3)
last_name, (4) email, (5) password, and (6) confirm_password
parameters to (b) userinput.php.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained from third party.  In
addition, the lack of precision in the third party descriptions makes
it unclear whether the named vectors are correct.
