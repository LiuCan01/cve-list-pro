** DISPUTED ** Buffer overflow in the font command of mIRC, probably
6.16, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long string.
NOTE: the original researcher claims that issue has been disputed by
the vendor, and that the vendor stated "as far as I can tell, this is
neither an exploit nor a vulnerability.  The above report describes a
local bug in mIRC."  It could be that this is only exploitable by the
user of the application, and thus would not cross privilege boundaries
unless under an otherwise restrictive environment such as a kiosk.
