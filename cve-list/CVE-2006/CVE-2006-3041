** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in Ltwcalendar/calendar.php in
Codewalkers Ltwcalendar 4.1.3 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the ltw_config[include_dir] parameter.
NOTE: CVE disputes this claim, since the $ltw_config[include_dir]
variable is defined as a static value in an include file before it is
referenced in an include() statement.
