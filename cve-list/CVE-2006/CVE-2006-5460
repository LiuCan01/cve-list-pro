** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Hinton Design
phpht Topsites allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the phpht_real_path parameter to (1) index.php, (2)
certain other scripts in the top-level directory, and (3) certain
scripts in the admin/ directory.  NOTE: CVE disputes this
vulnerability because $phpht_real_path is defined before use in
index.php and most other files except common.php, which is already
covered by CVE-2006-5458.
