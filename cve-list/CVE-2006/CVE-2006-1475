Windows Firewall in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 does not produce
application alerts when an application is executed using the NTFS
Alternate Data Streams (ADS) filename:stream syntax, which might allow
local users to launch a Trojan horse attack in which the victim does
not obtain the alert that Windows Firewall would have produced for a
non-ADS file.
