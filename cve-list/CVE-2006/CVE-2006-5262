CRLF injection vulnerability in lib/session.php in Hastymail 1.5 and
earlier before 20061008 allows remote authenticated users to send
arbitrary IMAP commands via a CRLF sequence in a mailbox name.  NOTE:
the attack crosses privilege boundaries if the IMAP server
configuration prevents a user from establishing a direct IMAP session.
