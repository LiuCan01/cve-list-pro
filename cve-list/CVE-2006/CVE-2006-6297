Stack consumption vulnerability in the KFILE JPEG (kfile_jpeg) plugin
in kdegraphics 3, as used by konqueror, digikam, and other KDE image
browsers, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack
consumption) via a crafted EXIF section in a JPEG file, which results
in an infinite recursion.
