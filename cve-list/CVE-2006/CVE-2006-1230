Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in create.php in
vCard 2.x allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the (1) card_id, (2) uploaded, (3) card_fontsize, or (4)
card_color parameter.  NOTE: the card_id vector was later reported to
affect vCard 2.9, and the uploaded vector for 2.6.
