Reference: BUGTRAQ:20060713 Orbitmatrix PHP Script v1.0
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/439970/100/0/threaded

index.php in Orbitcoders OrbitMATRIX 1.0 allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information (partial database schema) via a modified
page_name parameter, which reflects portions of an SQL query in the
result.  NOTE: it is not clear whether the information is
target-specific. If not, then this issue is not an exposure.
