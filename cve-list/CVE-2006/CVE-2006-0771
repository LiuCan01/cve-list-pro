Format string vulnerability in PunkBuster 1.180 and earlier, as used
by Soldier of Fortune II and possibly other games, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in invalid cvar
values, which are not properly handled when the server kicks the
player and records the reason.
