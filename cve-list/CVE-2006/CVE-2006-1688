Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in SQuery 4.5 and
earlier, as used in products such as Autonomous LAN party (ALP), allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
libpath parameter to scripts in the lib directory including (1)
ase.php, (2) devi.php, (3) doom3.php, (4) et.php, (5) flashpoint.php,
(6) gameSpy.php, (7) gameSpy2.php, (8) gore.php, (9) gsvari.php, (10)
halo.php, (11) hlife.php, (12) hlife2.php, (13) igi2.php, (14)
main.lib.php, (15) netpanzer.php, (16) old_hlife.php, (17) pkill.php,
(18) q2a.php, (19) q3a.php, (20) qworld.php, (21) rene.php, (22)
rvbshld.php, (23) savage.php, (24) simracer.php, (25) sof1.php, (26)
sof2.php, (27) unreal.php, (28) ut2004.php, and (29) vietcong.php.
NOTE: the lib/armygame.php vector is already covered by CVE-2006-1610.
The provenance of most of these additional vectors is unknown,
although likely from post-disclosure analysis.  NOTE: this only occurs
when register_globals is disabled.
