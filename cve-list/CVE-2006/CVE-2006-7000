Headstart Solutions DeskPRO allows remote attackers to obtain the full
path via direct requests to (1) email/mail.php, (2) includes/init.php,
(3) certain files in includes/cron/, and (4) jpgraph.php, (5)
jpgraph_bar.php, (6) jpgraph_pie.php, and (7) jpgraph_pie3d.php in
includes/graph/, which leaks the path in error messages.
