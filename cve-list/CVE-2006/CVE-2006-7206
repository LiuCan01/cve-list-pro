Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by creating a
ADODB.Recordset object and making a series of calls to the
NextRecordset method with a long string argument, which causes an
"invalid memory access" in the SysFreeString function, a different
issue than CVE-2006-3510 and CVE-2006-3899.
