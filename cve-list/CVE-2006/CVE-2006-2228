Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in w-Agora (aka Web-Agora)
4.2.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via a post with a BBCode tag that contains a JavaScript event name
followed by whitespace before the '=' (equals) character, which
bypasses a restrictive regular expression that attempts to remove
onmouseover and other events.
