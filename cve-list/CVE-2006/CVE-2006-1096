** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in NZ Ecommerce
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
action parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue in a
comment on the researcher's blog, but research by CVE suggests that
this might be a legitimate problem.
