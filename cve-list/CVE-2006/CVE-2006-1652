Multiple buffer overflows in (a) UltraVNC (aka Ultr@VNC) 1.0.1 and
earlier and (b) tabbed_viewer 1.29 (1) allow user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malicious server that sends
a long string to a client that connects on TCP port 5900, which
triggers an overflow in Log::ReallyPrint; and (2) allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a long HTTP
GET request to TCP port 5800, which triggers an overflow in
VNCLog::ReallyPrint.
