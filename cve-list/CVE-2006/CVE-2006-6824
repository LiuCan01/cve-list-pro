Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Jim Hu and Chad
Little PHP iCalendar 2.23 rc1 and earlier allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) getdate parameter in
(a) day.php, (b) month.php, (c) year.php, (d) week.php, (e)
search.php, (f) rss/index.php, (g) print.php, and (h) preferences.php;
the (2) cpath parameter in (i) day.php, (j) month.php, (k) year.php,
(l) week.php, and (m) search.php; the (3) query parameter in
search.php; and possibly the cpath, (4) unset, and (5) set parameters
in a setcookie action in preferences.php; different vectors than
CVE-2006-3319.  NOTE: it was later reported that vectors b, c, and d
also affect 2.24.
