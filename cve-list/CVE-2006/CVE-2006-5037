** DISPUTED **

MySource Matrix after 3.8 allows remote attackers to use the
application as an HTTP proxy server via a MIME encoded URL in the
sq_content_src parameter to access arbitrary sites with the server's
IP address and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  NOTE: the
researcher reports that "The vendor does not consider this a
vulnerability."
