** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Brian Fraval
Hitweb 3.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the REP_CLASS parameter to (1) index.php, (2) arbo.php, (3)
framepoint.php, (4) genpage.php, (5) lienvalider.php, (6)
appreciation.php, (7) partenariat.php, (8) rechercher.php, (9)
projet.php, (10) propoexample.php, (11) refererpoint.php, or (12)
top50.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party
researcher, stating that REP_CLASS is initialized in an included file
before being used.
