Buffer overflow in the web console in F-Secure Anti-Virus for
Microsoft Exchange 6.40, and Internet Gatekeeper 6.40 through 6.42 and
6.50 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown attack vectors.  NOTE: By
default, the connections are only allowed from the local host.
