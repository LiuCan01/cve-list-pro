** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Morcego CMS
0.9.6 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the (1) fichero parameter to morcegoCMS.php or the (2)
path parameter to adodb/adodb.inc.php.  NOTE: vector 1 has been
disputed by a third party who shows that $fichero can not be
controlled by an attacker.
