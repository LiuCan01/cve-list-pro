** DISPUTED **

Microsoft ISA Server 2004 allows remote attackers to bypass certain
filtering rules, including ones for (1) ICMP and (2) TCP, via IPv6
packets.  NOTE: An established researcher has disputed this issue,
saying that "Neither ISA Server 2004 nor Windows 2003 Basic Firewall
support IPv6 filtering ... This is different network protocol."
