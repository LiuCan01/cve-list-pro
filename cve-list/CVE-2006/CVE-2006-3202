The ip6_savecontrol function in NetBSD 2.0 through 3.0, under certain
configurations, does not check to see if IPv4-mapped sockets are being
used before processing IPv6 socket options, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service (crash) by creating an IPv4-mapped IPv6
socket with the SO_TIMESTAMP socket option set, then sending an IPv4
packet through the socket.
