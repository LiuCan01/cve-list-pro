The admin panel in Tr Forum 2.0 accepts a username and password hash
for authentication, which allows remote authenticated users to perform
unauthorized actions, as demonstrated by modifying user settings via
the id parameter to /membres/modif_profil.php, and changing a password
via /membres/change_mdp.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with other
Tr Forum vulnerabilities to allow unauthenticated attackers to gain
privileges.
