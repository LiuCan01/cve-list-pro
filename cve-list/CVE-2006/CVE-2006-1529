Unspecified vulnerability in Firefox and Thunderbird before 1.5.0.2,
and SeaMonkey before 1.0.1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown
attack vectors related to DHTML.  NOTE: due to the lack of sufficient
public details from the vendor as of 20060413, it is unclear how
CVE-2006-1529, CVE-2006-1530, CVE-2006-1531, and CVE-2006-1723 are
different.
