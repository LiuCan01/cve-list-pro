The original distribution of MyBulletinBoard (MyBB) to update from
older versions to 1.0.2 omits or includes older versions of certain
critical files, which allows attackers to conduct (1) SQL injection
attacks via an attachment name that is not properly handled by
inc/functions_upload.php (CVE-2005-4602), and possibly (2) other
attacks related to threadmode in usercp.php.
