** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in the JIM
component for Mambo and Joomla! allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.
NOTE: another researcher has stated that the product distribution does
not include an index.php file.  Also, this might be related to
CVE-2006-4242.
