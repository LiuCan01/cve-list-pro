The Languages selection in the admin interface in Kailash Nadh
boastMachine (formerly bMachine) 3.1 and earlier allows remote
authenticated administrators to upload files with arbitrary extensions
to the bmc/Inc/Lang directory.  NOTE: because the uploaded files cannot
be accessed through HTTP, this issue is a vulnerability only if there
is a likely usage pattern in which the files would be opened or
executed by local users, e.g., malware files with names that entice
local users to open the files.
