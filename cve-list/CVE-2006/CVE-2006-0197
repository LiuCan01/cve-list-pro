Reference: BUGTRAQ:20060108 xorg server 6.8.2 and below on 64bit arch
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/421256/100/0/threaded

The XClientMessageEvent struct used in certain components of X.Org
6.8.2 and earlier, possibly including (1) the X server and (2) Xlib,
uses a "long" specifier for elements of the l array, which results in
inconsistent sizes in the struct on 32-bit versus 64-bit platforms,
and might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) and possibly conduct other attacks.
