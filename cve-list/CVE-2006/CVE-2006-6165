** DISPUTED **

ld.so in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and possibly other BSD distributions does
not remove certain harmful environment variables, which allows local
users to gain privileges by passing certain environment variables to
loading processes.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third
party, stating that it is the responsibility of the application to
properly sanitize the environment.
