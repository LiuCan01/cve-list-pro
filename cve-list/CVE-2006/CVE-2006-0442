Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in usercp.php in
MyBulletinBoard (MyBB) 1.02 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via the (1) notepad parameter in a notepad action
and (2) signature parameter in an editsig action. NOTE: These are
different attack vectors, and probably a different vulnerability, than
CVE-2006-0218 and CVE-2006-0219.
