Directory traversal vulnerability in install05.php in Simple PHP Blog
(SPB) 0.4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to include and
execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences and a
NUL (%00) character in the blog_language parameter, as demonstrated by
injecting PHP sequences into an Apache access_log file, which is then
included using install05.php.
