Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database Server
8.1.7.4, 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.7, 10.1.0.5, and other versions have unknown
impact and attack vectors in the (1) Advanced Replication component,
as identified by Vuln# DB01, and (2) Oracle Spatial component, as
identified by Vuln# DB10.  NOTE: details are unavailable from Oracle,
but as of 20060421, they have not publicly disputed a claim by a
reliable independent researcher that states that DB01 is an unknown
issue in the DBMS_REPUTIL package, and DB10 is SQL injection in the
INSERT_CATALOG, UPDATE_CATALOG, and DELETE_CATALOG functions of the
SDO_CATALOG package.
