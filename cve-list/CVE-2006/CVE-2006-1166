Monotone 0.25 and earlier, when a user creates a file in a directory
called "mt", and when checking out that file on a case-insensitive
file system such as Windows or Mac OS X, places the file into the "MT"
bookkeeping directory, which could allow context-dependent attackers
to execute arbitrary Lua programs as the user running monotone.
