** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in userscript.php in Green
Minute 1.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the (1) huserid, (2) pituus, or (3) date parameters.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, saying "those
parameters mentioned ARE checked (preg_match) before they are used in
SQL-query...  If someone decided to add SQL-injection stuff to certain
parameter, they would see an error text, but only because _nothing_
was passed inside that parameter (to MySQL-database)."  As allowed by
the vendor, CVE investigated this report on 20060525 and found that
the demo site demonstrated a non-sensitive SQL error when given
standard SQL injection manipulations.
