Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in post.php in
SkyeBox 1.2.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the (1) name or (2) message parameters.  NOTE: the provenance
of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from
third party information, although it was likely prompted by a vague
announcement from a researcher who incorrectly referred to the product
as "SkyeShoutbox."
