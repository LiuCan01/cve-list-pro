Sugar Suite Open Source (SugarCRM) 4.2 and earlier, when
register_globals is enabled, does not protect critical variables such
as $_GLOBALS and $_SESSION from modification, which allows remote
attackers to conduct attacks such as directory traversal or PHP remote
file inclusion, as demonstrated by modifying the GLOBALS[sugarEntry]
parameter.
