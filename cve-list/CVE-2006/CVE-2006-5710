The Airport driver for certain Orinoco based Airport cards in Darwin
kernel 8.8.0 in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8, and possibly other versions,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an 802.11 probe
response frame without any valid information element (IE) fields after
the header, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
