Unspecified vulnerability in index.php in Warcraft III Replay Parser
for PHP 1.8c allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the page parameter, possibly related to fopen function calls
or file uploads.  NOTE: post-disclosure analysis by CVE suggests that
the "page" parameter is not used in this product, and "id" might be
the affected parameter.
