** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in big.php in pearlabs mafia
moblog 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the pathtotemplate parameter.  NOTE: a third party
claims that the researcher is incorrect, because template.php defines
pathtotemplate before big.php uses pathtotemplate.  CVE has not
verified either claim, but during August 2006, the original researcher
made several significant errors regarding this bug type.
