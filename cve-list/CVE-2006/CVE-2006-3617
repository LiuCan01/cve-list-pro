Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pblguestbook.php in
Pixelated By Lev (PBL) Guestbook 1.32 and earlier allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) name, (2)
message (aka comments), (3) website, and (4) email parameters, which
bypasses XSS protection mechanisms that check for SCRIPT tags but not
others, as demonstrated by a javascript URI in an onMouseOver
attribute and the src attribute in an iframe tag.  NOTE: some vectors
might overlap CVE-2006-2975, although the use of alternate
manipulations makes it unclear.
