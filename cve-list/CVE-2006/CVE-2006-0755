** DISPUTED **
Multiple PHP remote file include vulnerabilities in dotProject 2.0.1
and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary commands via the baseDir parameter in (1)
db_adodb.php, (2) db_connect.php, (3) session.php, (4)
vw_usr_roles.php, (5) calendar.php, (6) date_format.php, and (7)
tasks/gantt.php; and the dPconfig[root_dir] parameter in (8)
projects/gantt.php, (9) gantt2.php, and (10) vw_files.php.  NOTE: the
vendor disputes this issue, stating that the product documentation
clearly recommends that the system administrator disable
register_globals, and that the check.php script warns against this
setting.  Also, the vendor says that the protection.php/siteurl vector
is incorrect because protection.php does not exist in the product.
