Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in include.php in PHPKIT 1.6.1
Release 2 and earlier, with allow_url_fopen enabled, allows remote
attackers to conduct PHP remote file include attacks via a path
parameter that specifies a (1) UNC share or (2) ftps URL, which
bypasses the check for "http://", "ftp://", and "https://" URLs.
