Multiple direct static code injection vulnerabilities in
db/txt.inc.php in phpPowerCards 2.10, when register_globals is
enabled, allow remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files
via the (1) email[to], (2) email[from], (3) name[to], (4) name[from],
(5) picture, (6) comment, or (7) sessionID parameter, as demonstrated
by creating a new .php file that permits remote file inclusion, and
then requesting this file.
