The attachment scrubber (Scrubber.py) in Mailman 2.1.5 and earlier,
when using Python's library email module 2.5, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (mailing list delivery failure) via a
multipart MIME message with a single part that has two blank lines
between the first boundary and the end boundary.
