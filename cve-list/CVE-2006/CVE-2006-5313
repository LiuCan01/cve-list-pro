Hastymail 1.5 and earlier before 20061008 allows remote authenticated
users to send arbitrary SMTP commands by placing them after a
CRLF.CRLF sequence in the smtp_message parameter.  NOTE: this crosses
privilege boundaries if the SMTP server configuration prevents a user
from establishing a direct SMTP session.  NOTE: this is a different
type of issue than CVE-2006-5262.
