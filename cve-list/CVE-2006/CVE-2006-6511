dadaIMC .99.3 uses an insufficiently restrictive FilesMatch directive
in the installed .htaccess file, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading files whose names contain (1)
feature, (2) editor, (3) newswire, (4) otherpress, (5) admin, (6)
pbook, (7) media, or (8) mod, which are processed as PHP file types
(application/x-httpd-php).
