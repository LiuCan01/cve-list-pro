Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/455106/100/0/threaded

Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in Oracle Portal 9.0.2 and
possibly other versions allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via CRLF
sequences in the enc parameter to (1) calendarDialog.jsp or (2)
fred.jsp.  NOTE: the calendar.jsp vector is covered by CVE-2006-6697.
