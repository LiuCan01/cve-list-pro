Unspecified vulnerability in index.php in Core CoreNews 2.0.1 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the page parameter,
possibly due to a PHP remote file include vulnerability.  NOTE: this
vulnerability could not be confirmed by source code inspection of
CoreNews 2.0.1, which does not appear to use a "page" parameter or
variable.
