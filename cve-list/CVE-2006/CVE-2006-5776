** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusions in Ariadne 2.4.1 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the ariadne parameter in
(1) ftp/loader.php and (2) lib/includes/loader.cmd.php.  NOTE: this
issue is disputed by CVE, since installation instructions recommend
that the files be placed outside of the web document root and require
the administrator to modify $ariadne in an include file.
