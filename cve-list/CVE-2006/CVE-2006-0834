Uniden UIP1868P VoIP Telephone and Router has a default password of
admin for the web-based configuration utility, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information on the device such as
telephone numbers called, and possibly connect to other hosts.  NOTE:
it is possible that this password was configured by a reseller, not
the original vendor; if so, then this is not a vulnerability in the
product.
