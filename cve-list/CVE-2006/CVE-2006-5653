Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the errorHTML function in
the index script in Sun Java System Messenger Express 6 allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the error
parameter.  NOTE: this issue might be related to CVE-2006-5486,
however due to the vagueness of the initial advisory and different
researchers a new CVE was assigned.
