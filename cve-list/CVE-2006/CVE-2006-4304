Buffer overflow in the sppp driver in FreeBSD 4.11 through 6.1, NetBSD
2.0 through 4.0 beta before 20060823, and OpenBSD 3.8 and 3.9 before
20060902 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic),
obtain sensitive information, and possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted Link Control Protocol (LCP) packets with an option length that
exceeds the overall length, which triggers the overflow in (1) pppoe
and (2) ippp.  NOTE: this issue was originally incorrectly reported
for the ppp driver.
