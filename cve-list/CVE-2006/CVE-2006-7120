** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
lib/php/phphtmllib-2.5.4/examples/example6.php for maintain 3.0.0-RC2
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
phphtmllib parameter.  NOTE: this issue might be in phpHtmlLib.  NOTE:
CVE disputes this issue for proper installations of maintain, since
$phphtmllib is set in includes.inc before being used in example6.php.
