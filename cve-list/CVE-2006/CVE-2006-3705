Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 have
unknown impact and attack vectors, aka Oracle Vuln# (1) DB21 for
Statistics and (2) DB22 for Upgrade & Downgrade.  NOTE: as of
20060719, Oracle has not disputed a claim by a reliable researcher
that DB21 is for a local SQL injection vulnerability in
SYS.DBMS_STATS, and that DB22 is for SQL injection in
SYS.DBMS_UPGRADE.
