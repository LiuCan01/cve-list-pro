index.php in Horde Application Framework before 3.1.2 allows remote
attackers to include web pages from other sites, which could be useful
for phishing attacks, via a URL in the url parameter, aka "cross-site
referencing." NOTE: some sources have referred to this issue as XSS,
but it is different than classic XSS.
