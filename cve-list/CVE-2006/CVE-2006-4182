Integer overflow in ClamAV 0.88.1 and 0.88.4, and other versions
before 0.88.5, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(scanning service crash) and execute arbitrary code via a crafted
Portable Executable (PE) file that leads to a heap-based buffer
overflow when less memory is allocated than expected.
