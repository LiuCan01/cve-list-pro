Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Helm Web
Hosting Control Panel 3.2.10 allow remote authenticated users to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) txtCompanyName, (2)
txtEmail, or (3) txtUserAccNum parameter to (a) users.asp, or the (4)
setThemeColour parameter to (b) default.asp in the Reseller and Admin
levels; or the (5) setThemeColour parameter to default.asp in the User
level.  NOTE: the txtDomainName parameter to domains.asp is covered by
CVE-2006-1407, which suggests that this vector is fixed in 3.2.10
stable.
