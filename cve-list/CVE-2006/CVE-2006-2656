Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2
and earlier might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via
a long filename.  NOTE: tiffsplit is not setuid.  If there is not a
common scenario under which tiffsplit is called with
attacker-controlled command line arguments, then perhaps this issue
should not be included in CVE.
