Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/25994

Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.2, when designMode is enabled, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
code via certain Javascript that is not properly handled by the
contentWindow.focus method in an iframe, which causes a reference to a
deleted controller context object.  NOTE: this was originally claimed
to be a buffer overflow in (1) js320.dll and (2) xpcom_core.dll, but
the vendor disputes this claim.
