Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 1 protocol, as implemented on
Cisco IOS, VPN 3000 Concentrators, and PIX firewalls, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a
flood of IKE Phase-1 packets that exceed the session expiration rate.
NOTE: it has been argued that this is due to a design weakness of the
IKE version 1 protocol, in which case other vendors and
implementations would also be affected.
