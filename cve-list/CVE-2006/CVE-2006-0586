Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Oracle 10g Release 1 before
CPU Jan 2006 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
via multiple parameters in (1) ATTACH_JOB, (2) HAS_PRIVS, and (3)
OPEN_JOB functions in the SYS.KUPV$FT package; and (4) UPDATE_JOB, (5)
ACTIVE_JOB, (6) ATTACH_POSSIBLE, (7) ATTACH_TO_JOB, (8)
CREATE_NEW_JOB, (9) DELETE_JOB, (10) DELETE_MASTER_TABLE, (11)
DETACH_JOB, (12) GET_JOB_INFO, (13) GET_JOB_QUEUES, (14)
GET_SOLE_JOBNAME, (15) MASTER_TBL_LOCK, and (16) VALID_HANDLE
functions in the SYS.KUPV$FT_INT package.  NOTE: due to the lack of
relevant details from the Oracle advisory, a separate CVE is being
created since it cannot be conclusively proven that these issues has
been addressed by Oracle.  It is unclear which, if any, Oracle Vuln#
identifiers apply to these issues.
