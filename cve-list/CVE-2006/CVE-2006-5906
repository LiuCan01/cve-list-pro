** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
modules/bannieres/bannieres.php in Jean-Christophe Ramos SCRIPT
BANNIERES (aka ban 0.1 and PLS-Bannieres 1.21) allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the chemin parameter.  NOTE:
the issue is disputed by other researchers, who observe that $chemin
is defined before use.
