The scripting engine in Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (resource consumption) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a web page that contains a recurrent call to an
infinite loop in Javascript or VBscript, which consumes the stack, as
demonstrated by resetting the "location" variable within the loop.
