PowerPoint in Microsoft Office 2000, XP, 2003, 2004 for Mac, and v.X
for Mac does not properly parse the slide notes field in a document,
which allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code
via crafted data in this field, which triggers an erroneous object
pointer calculation that uses data from within the document. NOTE:
this issue is different than other PowerPoint vulnerabilities
including CVE-2006-4694.
