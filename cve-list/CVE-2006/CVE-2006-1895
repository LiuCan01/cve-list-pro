Direct static code injection vulnerability in includes/template.php in
phpBB allows remote authenticated users with write access to execute
arbitrary PHP code by modifying a template in a way that (1) bypasses
a loose ".*" regular expression to match BEGIN and END statements in
overall_header.tpl, or (2) is used in an eval statement by
includes/bbcode.php for bbcode.tpl.
