Unspecified vulnerability in the "dependency resolution mechanism" in
Ruby on Rails 1.1.0 through 1.1.5 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary Ruby code via a URL that is not properly handled in the
routing code, which leads to a denial of service (application hang) or
"data loss," a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-4111.
