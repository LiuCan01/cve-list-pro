Multiple buffer overflows in MODPlug Tracker (OpenMPT) 1.17.02.43 and
earlier and libmodplug 0.8 and earlier, as used in GStreamer and
possibly other products, allow user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via (1) long strings in ITP files used by the
CSoundFile::ReadITProject function in soundlib/Load_it.cpp and (2)
crafted modules used by the CSoundFile::ReadSample function in
soundlib/Sndfile.cpp, as demonstrated by crafted AMF files.
