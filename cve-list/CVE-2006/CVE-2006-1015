Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x
applications, when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input
for the additional_parameters argument to the mail function, allows
remote attackers to read and create arbitrary files via the sendmail
-C and -X arguments.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a class of
technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular instance;
if so, then this should not be included in CVE.
