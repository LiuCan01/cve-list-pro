PunBB 1.2.12 does not properly handle an avatar directory pathname
ending in %00, which allows remote authenticated administrative users
to upload arbitrary files and execute code, as demonstrated by a query
to admin_options.php with an avatars_dir parameter ending in %00.
NOTE: this issue was originally disputed by the vendor, but the
dispute was withdrawn on 20060926.
