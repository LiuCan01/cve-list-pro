TWiki 01-Dec-2000 up to 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to bypass the
upload filter and execute arbitrary code via filenames with double
extensions such as ".php.en", ".php.1", and other allowed extensions
that are not .txt.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the server
allows script execution in the pub directory.
