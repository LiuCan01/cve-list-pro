IE Tab 1.0.9 plugin for Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3 allows remote
user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash), possibly due to a null dereference, via certain Javascript, as
demonstrated using a url parameter to the content/reloaded.html page
in a chrome:// URI.  Some third-party researchers claim that they are
unable to reproduce this vulnerability.
