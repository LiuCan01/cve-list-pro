Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in index.php in
coolphp magazine allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via the (1) op and (2) nick parameters, and possibly the (3)
0000, (4) userinfo, (5) comp_der, (6) encuestas, and (7) pagina
parameters.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this is a distributable
product or a site-specific vulnerability. If it is site-specific, then
it should not be included in CVE.
