Multiple buffer overflows in Sophos Anti-Virus scanning engine before
2.40 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a SIT
archive with a long filename that is not null-terminated, which
triggers a heap-based overflow in veex.dll due to improper length
calculation, and (2) a CPIO archive, with a long filename that is not
null-terminated, which triggers a stack-based overflow in veex.dll.
