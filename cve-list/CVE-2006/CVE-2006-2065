SQL injection vulnerability in save.php in PHPSurveyor 0.995 and
earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
the surveyid cookie.  NOTE: this issue could be leveraged to execute
arbitrary PHP code, as demonstrated by inserting directory traversal
sequences into the database, which are then processed by the
thissurvey['language'] variable.
