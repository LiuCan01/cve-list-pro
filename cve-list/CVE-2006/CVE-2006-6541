** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in signer/final.php in warez
distributions of Animated Smiley Generator allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the smiley parameter.  NOTE:
the vendor disputes this issue, stating that only Warez versions of
Animated Smiley Generator were affected, not the developer-provided
software: "Legitimately purchased applications do not allow this
exploit."
