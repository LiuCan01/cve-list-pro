BomberClone 0.11.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) via (1) a certain malformed
PKGF_ackreq packet, which triggers a crash in the rscache_add()
function in pkgcache.c; and (2) an error packet, which is intended to
be received by clients and force client shutdown, but also triggers
server shutdown.
