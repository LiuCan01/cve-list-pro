desktop.php in eyeOS 0.8.9 and earlier tests for the existence of the
_SESSION variable before calling the session_start function, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code and possibly
conduct other attacks by modifying critical assumed-immutable
variables, as demonstrated using PHP code in the
_SESSION[apps][eyeOptions.eyeapp][wrapup] variable.
