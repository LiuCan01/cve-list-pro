The embedded HTTP server in Fuji Xerox Printing Systems (FXPS) print
engine, as used in products including (1) Dell 3000cn through 5110cn
and (2) Fuji Xerox DocuPrint firmware before 20060628 and Network
Option Card firmware before 5.13, does not properly perform
authentication for HTTP requests, which allows remote attackers to
modify system configuration via crafted requests, including changing
the administrator password or causing a denial of service to the print
server.
