Directory traversal vulnerability in admin/deleteuser.php in HitHost
1.0.0 might allow remote attackers to delete directories (possibly
only empty directories) via the $deleteuser variable.  NOTE: the
initial disclosure for this issue indicated that the researcher was
unable to prove this issue; however, this might have been due to
certain behaviors of rmdir.
