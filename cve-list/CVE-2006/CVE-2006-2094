Microsoft Internet Explorer before Windows XP Service Pack 2 and
Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, when Prompt is configured in
Security Settings, uses modal dialogs to verify that a user wishes to
run an ActiveX control or perform other risky actions, which allows
user-assisted remote attackers to construct a race condition that
tricks a user into clicking an object or pressing keys that are
actually applied to a "Yes" approval for executing the control.
