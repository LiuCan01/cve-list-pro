PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
includes/functions_common.php in the VWar Account module
(vWar_Account) in PHPNuke Clan 3.0.1 allows remote attackers to
include arbitrary files via a URL in the vwar_root2 parameter.  NOTE:
it is possible that this issue stems from a problem in VWar itself,
but this is not clear.
