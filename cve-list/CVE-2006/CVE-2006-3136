** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Nucleus 3.23
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL the
DIR_LIBS parameter in (1) path/action.php, and to files in
path/nucleus including (2) media.php, (3) /xmlrpc/server.php, and (4)
/xmlrpc/api_metaweblog.inc.php.  NOTE: this is a similar vulnerability
to CVE-2006-2583.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third
parties, who state that the DIR_LIBS parameter is defined in an
include file before being used.
