** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Invision Power Board (IPB)
1.3 Final allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
the CODE parameter in a (1) Stats, (2) Mail, and (3) Reg action in
index.php. NOTE: the developer has disputed this issue, stating that
"At no point does the CODE parameter touch the database. The CODE
parameter is used in a SWITCH statement to determine which function to
run."
