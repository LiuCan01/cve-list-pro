Buffer overflow in Tenes Empanadas Graciela (TEG) 0.11.1,
automatically appends an _ (underscore) to the end of duplicate
nicknames, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) by creating multiple users with long, identical
nicknames, which triggers an off-by-one error.
