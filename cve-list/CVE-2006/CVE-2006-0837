IBM Tivoli Micromuse Netcool/NeuSecure 3.0.236 has world-readable
permissions for (1) /etc/neusecure.conf, (2)
/opt/NeuSecure/etc/cms-3.0.236.buildconf, and (3)
/opt/NeuSecure/bin/ns_archiver.log, which allows local users to read
sensitive information such as passwords.  NOTE: IBM has privately
confirmed to CVE that a fix is available for these issues.
