PHP before 4.4.3 and 5.x before 5.1.4 does not limit the character set
of the session identifier (PHPSESSID) for third party session
handlers, which might make it easier for remote attackers to exploit
other vulnerabilities by inserting PHP code into the PHPSESSID, which
is stored in the session file.  NOTE: it could be argued that this not
a vulnerability in PHP itself, rather a design limitation that enables
certain attacks against session handlers that do not account for this
limitation.
