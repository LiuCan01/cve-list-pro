Reference: BUGTRAQ:20060228 Virex on-access scanning unreliable
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/426348/100/0/threaded

The on-access scanner for McAfee Virex 7.7 for Macintosh, in some
circumstances, might not activate when malicious content is accessed
from the web browser, and might not prevent the content from being
saved, which allows remote attackers to bypass virus protection, as
demonstrated using the EICAR test file.
