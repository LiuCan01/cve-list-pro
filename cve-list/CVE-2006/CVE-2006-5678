** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
common/visiteurs/include/library.inc.php in J-Pierre DEZELUS Les
Visiteurs 2.0.1, as used in phpMyConferences (phpMyConference) 8.0.2
and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the lvc_modules_dir parameter.  NOTE:
CVE disputes this vulnerability, because the inclusion occurs in a
function that is not called during a direct request to
library.inc.php.
