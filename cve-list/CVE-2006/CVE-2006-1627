Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions 6.0 does not provide
proper access control, which allows remote authenticated users to
perform privileged actions by modifying the (1) actionID and (2)
pageID parameters.  NOTE: due to an error during reservation, this
identifier was inadvertently associated with multiple issues.  Other
CVE identifiers have been assigned to handle other problems that are
covered by the same disclosure.
