Integer signedness error in the enet_protocol_handle_incoming_commands
function in protocol.c for ENet library CVS version Jul 2005 and
earlier, as used in products including (1) Cube, (2) Sauerbraten, and
(3) Duke3d_w32, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a packet with a large command length value,
which leads to an invalid memory access.
