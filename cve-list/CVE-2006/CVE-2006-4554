Stack-based buffer overflow in the ReadFile function in the
ZOO-processing exports in the BeCubed Compression Plus before
5.0.1.28, as used in products including (1) Tumbleweed EMF, (2)
VCOM/Ontrack PowerDesk Pro, (3) Canyon Drag and Zip, (4) Canyon Power
File, and (5) Canyon Power File Gold, allow context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code via an inconsistent size parameter
in a ZOO file header.
