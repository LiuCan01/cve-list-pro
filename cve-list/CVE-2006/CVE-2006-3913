Buffer overflow in Freeciv 2.1.0-beta1 and earlier, and SVN 15 Jul
2006 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a (1) negative
chunk_length or a (2) large chunk->offset value in a
PACKET_PLAYER_ATTRIBUTE_CHUNK packet in the
generic_handle_player_attribute_chunk function in common/packets.c,
and (3) a large packet->length value in the handle_unit_orders
function in server/unithand.c.
