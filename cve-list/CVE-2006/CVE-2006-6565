FileZilla Server before 0.9.22 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) via a wildcard argument to the (1) LIST or
(2) NLST commands, which results in a NULL pointer dereference, a
different set of vectors than CVE-2006-6564.  NOTE: CVE analysis
suggests that the problem might be due to a malformed PORT command.
