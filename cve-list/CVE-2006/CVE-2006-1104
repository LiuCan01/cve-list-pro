Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Pixelpost 1.5 beta 1 and
earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
(1) the showimage parameter in index.php; and the (2) USER_AGENT, (3)
HTTP_REFERER, and (4) HTTP_HOST HTTP header fields as used in the
book_vistor function in includes/functions.php.  NOTE: the vendor has
disputed some issues from the original disclosure, but due to the
vagueness of the dispute, it is not clear whether the vendor is
disputing this particular issue.
