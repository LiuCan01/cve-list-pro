TWiki 4.0.5 and earlier, when running under Apache 1.3 using
ApacheLogin with sessions and "ErrorDocument 401" redirects to a valid
wiki topic, does not properly handle failed login attempts, which
allows remote attackers to read arbitrary content by cancelling out of
a failed authentication with a valid username and invalid password.
