Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/24744

gpgv in GnuPG before 1.4.2.1, when using unattended signature
verification, returns a 0 exit code in certain cases even when the
detached signature file does not carry a signature, which could cause
programs that use gpgv to assume that the signature verification has
succeeded.  Note: this also occurs when running the equivalent command
"gpg --verify".
