A "programming error" in fast_ipsec in FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE through
6.1-STABLE and NetBSD 2 through 3 does not properly update the
sequence number associated with a Security Association, which allows
packets to pass sequence number checks and allows remote attackers to
capture IPSec packets and conduct replay attacks.
