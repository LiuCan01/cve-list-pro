Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/28942

Heap-based buffer overflow in the DirectAnimation Path Control
(DirectAnimation.PathControl) COM object (daxctle.ocx) for Internet
Explorer 6.0 SP1, on Chinese and possibly other Windows distributions,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown
manipulations in arguments to the KeyFrame method, possibly related to
an integer overflow, as demonstrated by daxctle2, and a different
vulnerability than CVE-2006-4446.
