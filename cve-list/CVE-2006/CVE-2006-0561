Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) 3.x for Windows stores ACS
administrator passwords and the master key in the registry with
insecure permissions, which allows local users and remote
administrators to decrypt the passwords by using Microsoft's
cryptographic API functions to obtain the plaintext version of the
master key.
