Heap-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime before 7.1 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted BMP file that
triggers the overflow in the ReadBMP function.  NOTE: this issue was
originally included as item 3 in CVE-2006-1983, but it has been given
a separate identifier because it is a distinct issue.
