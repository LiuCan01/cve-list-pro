Direct static code injection vulnerability in the modify_config action
in admin.php for PHP-Stats 0.1.9.1 and earlier allows remote
authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code via the
option_new[compatibility_mode] parameter, which is not filtered before
being stored in config.php.  NOTE: this vulnerability can be exploited
by remote unauthenticated attackers in conjunction with the
option[admin_pass] authentication bypass vulnerability.
