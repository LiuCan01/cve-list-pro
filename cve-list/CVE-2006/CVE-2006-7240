Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/42052

gnome-power-manager 2.14.0 does not properly implement the
lock_on_suspend and lock_on_hibernate settings for locking the screen
when the suspend or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it
easier for physically proximate attackers to access an unattended
laptop via a resume action, a related issue to CVE-2010-2532.
