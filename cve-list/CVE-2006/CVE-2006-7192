Microsoft ASP .NET Framework 2.0.50727.42 does not properly handle
comment (/* */) enclosures, which allows remote attackers to bypass
request filtering and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or
cause a denial of service, as demonstrated via an xss:expression STYLE
attribute in a closing XSS HTML tag.
