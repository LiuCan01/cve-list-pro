** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the Content
Management module ("Content manager") for PHProjekt 0.6.1, when
register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via the path_pre parameter in (1) cm_lib.inc.php,
(2) doc/br.edithelp.php, (3) doc/de.edithelp.php, (4)
doc/ct.edithelp.php, (5) userrating.php, and (6) listing.php, a
different set of vectors than CVE-2006-4204.  NOTE: a third-party
researcher has disputed the impact of the cm_lib.inc.php vector,
stating that it is limited to local file inclusion. CVE analysis as of
20060905 concurs, although use of ftp URLs is also possible. The
remaining five vectors have also been disputed by the same third
party, stating that the path_pre variable is initialized before it is
used.
