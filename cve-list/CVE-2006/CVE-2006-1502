Multiple integer overflows in MPlayer 1.0pre7try2 allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service and trigger heap-based buffer
overflows via (1) a certain ASF file handled by asfheader.c that
causes the asf_descrambling function to be passed a negative integer
after the conversion from a char to an int or (2) an AVI file with a
crafted wLongsPerEntry or nEntriesInUse value in the indx chunk, which
is handled in aviheader.c.
