MyBB (MyBulletinBoard) 1.1.0 does not set the constant KILL_GLOBAL
variable in (1) global.php and (2) inc/init.php, which allows remote
attackers to initialize arbitrary variables that are processed by an
@extract command, which could then be leveraged to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) or SQL injection attacks.
