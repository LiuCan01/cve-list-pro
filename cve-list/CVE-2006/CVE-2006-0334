Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search.php in My Amazon
Store Manager 1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the Keywords parameter.  NOTE: some sources claim
that the affected parameter is "q", but the only public archive of the
original researcher notification shows an XSS manipulation in
"Keywords".
