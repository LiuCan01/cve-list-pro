Nokia N70 cell phone allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (reboot or shutdown) through a wireless Bluetooth connection
via a malformed Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)
packet whose length field is less than the actual length of the
packet, possibly triggering a buffer overflow, as demonstrated using
the Bluetooth Stack Smasher (BSS).
