** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in contentpublisher.php in the
contentpublisher component (com_contentpublisher) for Mambo allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
by third parties who state that contentpublisher.php protects against
direct request in the most recent version.  The original researcher is
known to be frequently inaccurate.
