** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in ATutor 1.5.3 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the fid parameter.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who states "The
mentioned SQL injection vulnerability is not possible."  However,
the relevant source code suggests that this issue may be legitimate,
and the parameter is cleansed in 1.5.3.1.
