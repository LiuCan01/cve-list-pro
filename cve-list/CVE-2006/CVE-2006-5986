admin/options.php in Extreme CMS 0.9, and possibly earlier, does not
require authentication, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
unauthorized activities.  NOTE: this issue can be combined with
another vulnerability to expand the scope of a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack without authentication.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; details are obtained from third party sources.
