Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/24107

Direct static code injection vulnerability in edit.php in ACal
Calendar Project 2.2.5 allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary
PHP code via (1) the edit=header value, which modifies header.php, or
(2) the edit=footer value, which modifies footer.php.  NOTE: this
issue might be resultant from the poor authentication as identified by
CVE-2006-0182.  Since the design of the product allows the
administrator to edit the code, perhaps this issue should not be
included in CVE, except as a consequence of CVE-2006-0182.
