Stack-based buffer overflow in Novell GroupWise Messenger before 2.0
Public Beta 2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
long Accept-Language value without a comma or semicolon.  NOTE: due to
a typo, the original ZDI advisory accidentally referenced
CVE-2006-0092.  This is the correct identifier.
