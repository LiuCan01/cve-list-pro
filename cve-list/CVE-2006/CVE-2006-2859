** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in MyBloggie 2.1.1 and earlier
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mybloggie_root_path parameter to (1) admin.php or (2) scode.php.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed in multiple third party followups,
which say that the MyBloggie source code does not demonstrate the
issue, so it might be the result of another module.  CVE analysis as
of 20060605 agrees with the dispute.  In addition, scode.php is not
part of the MyBloggie distribution.
