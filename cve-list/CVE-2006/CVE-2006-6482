Adobe ColdFusion MX7 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via a URL request (1) for a non-existent (a) JWS, (b) CFM,
(c) CFML, or (d) CFC file, which displays the installation path in the
resulting error message; or (2) to /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm
without a host, which can reveal the server's internal IP address in
an HREF tag.
