** DISPUTED **

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Small
Business Server 2003 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (IP stack hang) via a continuous stream of packets on TCP port
135 that have incorrect TCP header checksums and random numbers in
certain TCP header fields, as demonstrated by the Achilles Windows
Attack Tool.  NOTE: the researcher reports that the Microsoft Security
Response Center has stated "Our investigation which has included code
review, review of the TCPDump, and attempts on reproing the issue on
multiple fresh installs of various Windows Operating Systems have all
resulted in non confirmation."
