PHP before 5.1.3-RC1 might allow remote attackers to obtain portions
of memory via crafted binary data sent to a script that processes user
input in the html_entity_decode function and sends the encoded results
back to the client, aka a "binary safety" issue.  NOTE: this issue has
been referred to as a "memory leak," but it is an information leak
that discloses memory contents.
