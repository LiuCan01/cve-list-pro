Directory traversal vulnerability in footer.php in David Bennett
PHP-Post (PHPp) 1.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to read and
include arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the
template parameter.  NOTE: this was later reported to affect 1.0.1,
and demonstrated for code execution by uploading and accessing an
avatar file.
