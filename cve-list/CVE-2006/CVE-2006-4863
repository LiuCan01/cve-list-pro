** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Marc Cagninacci
mcLinksCounter 1.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the langfile parameter in (1) login.php, (2)
stats.php, (3) detail.php, or (4) erase.php.  NOTE: CVE and a third
party dispute this vulnerability, because the langfile parameter is
set to english.php in each file.  NOTE: CVE also disputes a later
report of this vulnerability in 1.2, because the langfile parameter is
set to french.php in 1.2.
