Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26958

useradd in shadow-utils before 4.0.3, and possibly other versions
before 4.0.8, does not provide a required argument to the open
function when creating a new user mailbox, which causes the mailbox to
be created with unpredictable permissions and possibly allows
attackers to read or modify the mailbox.
