Agnitum Outpost Firewall Pro 3.51.759.6511 (462), as used in (1)
Lavasoft Personal Firewall 1.0.543.5722 (433) and (2) Novell
BorderManager Novell Client Firewall 2.0, does not properly restrict
user activities in application windows that run in a LocalSystem
context, which allows local users to gain privileges and execute
commands (a) via the "open folder" option when no instance of
explorer.exe is running, possibly related to the ShellExecute API
function; or (b) by overwriting a batch file through the "Save
Configuration As" option. NOTE: this might be a vulnerability in
Microsoft Windows and explorer.exe instead of the firewall.
