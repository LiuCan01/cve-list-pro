Teredo clients, when located behind a restricted NAT, allow remote
attackers to establish an inbound connection without the guessing
required to find a port mapping for a traditional restricted NAT
client, by (1) using the client port number contained in the Teredo
address or (2) following the bubble-to-open procedure.
