** DISPUTED **

Off-by-one buffer overflow in the
Instance_options::complete_initialization function in
instance_options.cc in the Instance Manager in MySQL before 5.0.23 and
5.1 before 5.1.12 might allow local users to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via unspecified vectors, which triggers the
overflow when the convert_dirname function is called.  NOTE: the
vendor has disputed this issue via e-mail to CVE, saying that it is
only exploitable when the user has access to the configuration file or
the Instance Manager daemon.  Due to intended functionality, this
level of access would already allow the user to disrupt program
operation, so this does not cross security boundaries and is not a
vulnerability.
