** DISPUTED **

Microsoft Terminal Server, when running an application session with
the "Start program at logon" and "Override settings from user profile
and Client Connection Manager wizard" options, allows local users to
execute arbitrary code by forcing an Explorer error.  NOTE: a
third-party researcher has stated that the options are "a convenience
to users" and were not intended to restrict execution of arbitrary
code.
