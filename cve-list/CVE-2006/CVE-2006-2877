Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26933

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in Bookmark4U 2.0.0 and
earlier allows remote attackers to include arbitrary PHP files via the
include_prefix parameter in (1) inc/dbase.php, (2) inc/config.php, (3)
inc/common.php, and (4) inc/function.php.  NOTE: it has been reported
that the inc directory is protected by a .htaccess file, so this issue
only applies in certain environments or configurations.
