Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Simple PHP Blog
(SPHPBlog), probably 0.4.8, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via (1) the action parameter in add_block.php or
(2) the entry parameter in index.php, different vectors than
CVE-2005-1135.  NOTE: this has been reported to affect 0.8, but as of
20061121, the most recent version is only 0.4.9.
