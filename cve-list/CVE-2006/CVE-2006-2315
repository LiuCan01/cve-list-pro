** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in session.inc.php in
ISPConfig 2.2.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the go_info[server][classes_root]
parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, saying
that session.inc.php is not under the web root in version 2.2, and
register_globals is not enabled.
