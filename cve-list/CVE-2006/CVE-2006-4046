Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Open Cubic Player 2.6.0pre6
and earlier for Windows, and 0.1.10_rc5 and earlier on Linux/BSD,
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a large .S3M
file handled by the mpLoadS3M function, (2) a crafted .IT file handled
by the itplayerclass::module::load function, (3) a crafted .ULT file
handled by the mpLoadULT function, or (4) a crafted .AMS file handled
by the mpLoadAMS function.
