Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Shopweezle 2.0 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) itemID
parameter to (a) login.php and (b) memo.php; and the (2) itemgr, (3)
brandID, and (4) album parameters to (c) index.php.  NOTE: this issue
also produces resultant full path disclosure from invalid SQL queries.
