Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Docebo 3.0.3 and
earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in (1) GLOBALS[where_framework]
to (a) admin/modules/news/news_class.php and (b)
admin/modules/content/content_class.php, and (2) GLOBALS[where_cms] to
(c) admin/modules/block_media/util.media.php.  NOTE: this issue might
be resultant from a global overwrite vulnerability.  This issue is
similar to CVE-2006-2576, but the vectors are different.
