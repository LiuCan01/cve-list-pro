Multiple format string vulnerabilities in xiTK (xitk/main.c) in xine
0.99.4 might allow attackers to cause a denial of service via format
string specifiers in an MP3 filename specified on the command line.
NOTE: this is a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-1905.  In
addition, if the only attack vectors involve a user-assisted, local
command line argument of a non-setuid program, this issue might not be
a vulnerability.
