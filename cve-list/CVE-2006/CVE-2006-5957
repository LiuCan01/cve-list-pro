** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in INFINICART allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) groupid
parameter in (a) browse_group.asp, (2) productid parameter in (b)
added_to_cart.asp, and (3) catid and (4) subid parameter in (c)
browsesubcat.asp.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this report, saying
"The vulnerabilities mentioned were never present in our official
released products but only in the unofficial demo version. However we
do appreciate the information. We have update our demo version and
made sure all those vulnerabilities are fixed."
