** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2006-0992, CVE-2006-0158.

Reason: this candidate was intended for one issue, but a typo caused
it to be associated with a Novell/Groupwise issue.  In addition, this
issue was a duplicate of a SiteSuite issue that was also assigned
CVE-2006-0158.  Notes: All CVE users should consult CVE-2006-0992 and
CVE-2006-0158 to determine which ID is appropriate.  All references
and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent
accidental usage.
