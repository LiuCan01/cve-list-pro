The supersede_lease function in memory.c in ISC DHCP (dhcpd) server
2.0pl5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32 byte
client-identifier, which causes the packet to be interpreted as a
corrupt uid and causes the server to exit with "corrupt lease uid."
