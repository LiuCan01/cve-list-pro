Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in mcGuestbook 1.3
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
lang parameter to (1) admin.php, (2) ecrire.php, and (3) lire.php.
NOTE: it was later reported that the ecrire.php vector also affects
1.2.  NOTE: this issue might be limited to a race condition during
installation or an improper installation, since a completed
installation creates an include file that prevents external control of
the $lang variable.
