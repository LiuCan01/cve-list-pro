Microsoft w3wp (aka w3wp.exe) does not properly handle when the
AspCompat directive is not used when referencing COM components in
ASP.NET, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(resource consumption or crash) by repeatedly requesting each of
several documents that refer to COM components, or are restricted
documents located under the ASP.NET application path.
