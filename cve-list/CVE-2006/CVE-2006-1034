Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Woltlab Burning
Board (wBB) allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via (1) the username parameter to galerie_index.php and possibly
(2) galerie_onfly.php.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is
unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
The second vector might not be XSS.
