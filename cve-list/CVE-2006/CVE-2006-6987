Cross-domain vulnerability in FineBrowser Freeware 3.2.2 allows remote
attackers to access restricted information from other domains via an
object tag with a data parameter that references a link on the
attacker's originating site that specifies a Location HTTP header that
references the target site, which then makes that content available
through the outerHTML attribute of the object, a similar vulnerability
to CVE-2006-3280.
