Format string vulnerability in /bin/ftp in UNICOS 9.0.2.2 allows local
users to have an unknown impact via format string specifiers in the
quote command.  NOTE: because the program is not setuid and not
normally called from remote programs, there may not be a typical
attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries.
Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
