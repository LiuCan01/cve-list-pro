Multiple buffer overflows in Eudora Worldmail, possibly Worldmail 3
version 6.1.22.0, have unknown impact and attack vectors, as
demonstrated by the (1) "Eudora WorldMail stack overflow" and (2)
"Eudora WorldMail heap overflow" modules in VulnDisco Pack.  NOTE: Some
of these details are obtained from third party information. As of
20061118, this disclosure has no actionable information. However,
because the VulnDisco Pack author is a reliable researcher, the issue
is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
