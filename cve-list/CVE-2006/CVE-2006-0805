The CAPTCHA functionality in php-Nuke 6.0 through 7.9 uses fixed
challenge/response pairs that only vary once per day based on the User
Agent (HTTP_USER_AGENT), which allows remote attackers to bypass
CAPTCHA controls by fixing the User Agent, performing a valid
challenge/response, then replaying that pair in the random_num and
gfx_check parameters.
