Ralf Image Gallery (RIG) 0.7.4 and other versions before 1.0, when
register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to conduct PHP
remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks via URLs or ".."
sequences in the (1) dir_abs_src parameter in (a) check_entry.php, (b)
admin_album.php, (c) admin_image.php, and (d) admin_util.php; and the
(2) dir_abs_admin_src parameter in admin_album.php and
admin_image.php.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
