MDaemon 9.0.5, 9.0.6, 9.51, and 9.53, and possibly other versions,
installs the MDaemon application folder with insecure permissions
(Users create files/directories), which allows local users to execute
arbitrary code by creating malicious RASAPI32.DLL or MPRAPI.DLL
libraries in the MDaemonAPP folder, which is an untrusted search path
element due to insecure permissions.
