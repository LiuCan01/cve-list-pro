Untrusted search path vulnerability in the TrueVector service
(VSMON.exe) in Zone Labs ZoneAlarm 6.x and Integrity does not search
ZoneAlarm's own folders before other folders that are specified in a
user's PATH, which might allow local users to execute code as SYSTEM
by placing malicious DLLs into a folder that has insecure permissions,
but is searched before ZoneAlarm's folder.  NOTE: since this issue is
dependent on the existence of a vulnerability in a separate product
(weak permissions of executables or libraries, or the execution of
malicious code), perhaps it should not be included in CVE.
