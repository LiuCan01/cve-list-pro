Directory traversal vulnerability in newpost.php in Ultimate PHP Board
(UPB) 1.9.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary
files via a .. (dot dot) sequence and trailing null (%00) byte in the
id parameter, as demonstrated by injecting a Perl CGI script using
"[NR]" sequences in the message parameter, then calling close.php with
modified id and t_id parameters to chmod the script.  NOTE: this issue
might be resultant from dynamic variable evaluation.
