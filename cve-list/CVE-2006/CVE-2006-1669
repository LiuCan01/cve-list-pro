SQL injection vulnerability in chat/messagesL.php3 in phpHeaven Team
PHPMyChat 0.14.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the T parameter.  NOTE: this issue can be
leveraged to execute arbitrary shell commands since the username is
later processed in an eval() call, but since the username originated
from the SQL injection, it could be a resultant issue.
