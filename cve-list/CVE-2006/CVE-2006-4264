** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the
lmtg_myhomepage Component (com_lmtg_myhomepage) for Mambo allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter in (1) install.lmtg_homepage.php and
(2) mtg_homepage.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third
party, who states that the $mosConfig_absolute_path variable is only
used within a function definition.  CVE source code analysis on
20060824 is not conclusive but tends to concur with the dispute.  In
addition, it appears that the component name is actually
"lmtg_myhomepage".
