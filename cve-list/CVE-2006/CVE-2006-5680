The libarchive library in FreeBSD 6-STABLE after 2006-09-05 and before
2006-11-08 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (CPU consumption) via a malformed archive that causes
libarchive to skip a region past the actual end of the archive, which
triggers an infinite loop that attempts to read more data.
