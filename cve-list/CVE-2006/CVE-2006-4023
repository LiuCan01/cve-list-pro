The ip2long function in PHP 5.1.4 and earlier may incorrectly validate
an arbitrary string and return a valid network IP address, which
allows remote attackers to obtain network information and facilitate
other attacks, as demonstrated using SQL injection in the
X-FORWARDED-FOR Header in index.php in MiniBB 2.0.  NOTE: it could be
argued that the ip2long behavior represents a risk for
security-relevant issues in a way that is similar to strcpy's role in
buffer overflows, in which case this would be a class of
implementation bugs that would require separate CVE items for each PHP
application that uses ip2long in a security-relevant manner.
