** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in member.php in vBulletin
3.5.x allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via the u parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this report,
stating that they have been unable to replicate the issue and that
"the userid parameter is run through our filtering system as an
unsigned integer."
