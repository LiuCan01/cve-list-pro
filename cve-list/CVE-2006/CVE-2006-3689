** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in user-func.php in Codeworks
Gnomedia SubberZ[Lite] allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
PHP code via a URL in the myadmindir parameter.  NOTE: this issue has
been disputed by a third party that claims that " the myadmindir
variable is set before any GET variables are processed."
