PasswordSafe 3.0 beta, when running on Windows before XP, uses a weak
random number generator (C++ rand function) during generation of the
database encryption key, which makes it easier for attackers to
decrypt the database and steal passwords by generating keys for all
possible rand() seed values and conducting a known plaintext attack.
