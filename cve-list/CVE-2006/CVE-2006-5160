** DISPUTED **

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox have
unspecified vectors and impact, as claimed during ToorCon 2006.  NOTE:
the vendor and original researchers have released a follow-up comment
disputing this issue, in which one researcher states that "I have no
undisclosed Firefox vulnerabilities. The person who was speaking with
me made this claim, and I honestly have no idea if he has them or
not."
