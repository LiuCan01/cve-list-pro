The Graphical Device Interface Plus library (gdiplus.dll) in Microsoft
Windows XP SP2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via certain images that trigger a
divide-by-zero error, as demonstrated by a (1) .ico file, (2) .png
file that crashes MSN Messenger, and (3) .jpg file that crashes
Internet Explorer.  NOTE: another researcher has not been able to
reproduce this issue.
