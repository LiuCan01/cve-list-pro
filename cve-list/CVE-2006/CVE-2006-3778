IBM Lotus Notes 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 does not properly handle replies to
e-mail messages with alternate name users when the (1) "Save As Draft"
option is used or (2) a "," (comma) is inside the "phrase" portion of
an address, which can cause the e-mail to be sent to users that were
deleted from the To, CC, and BCC fields, which allows remote attackers
to obtain the list of original recipients.
