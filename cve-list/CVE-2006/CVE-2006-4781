Heap-based buffer overflow in FutureSoft TFTP Server Multithreaded
(MT) 1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted packet to port
69/UDP, which triggers the overflow when constructing an absolute path
name.  NOTE: Some details are obtained from third party information.
