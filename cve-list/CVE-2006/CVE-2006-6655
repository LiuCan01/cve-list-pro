The procfs implementation in NetBSD-current before 20061023, NetBSD
3.0 and 3.0.1 before 20061024, and NetBSD 2.x before 20061029 allows
local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by attempting
to access /emul/linux/proc/0/stat on a procfs filesystem that was
mounted with mount_procfs -o linux, which results in a NULL pointer
dereference.
