Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in cpaint2.inc.php in the
CPAINT library before 2.0.3, as used in multiple scripts, allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
cpaint_response_type parameter, which is displayed in a resulting
error message, as demonstrated using a hex-encoded IFRAME tag.
