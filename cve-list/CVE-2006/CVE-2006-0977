Craig Morrison Mail Transport System Professional (aka MTS Pro) acts
as an open relay when configured to relay all mail through an external
SMTP server, which allows remote attackers to relay mail by connecting
to the MTS Pro server, then sending a MAIL FROM that specifies a
domain that is local to the server.
