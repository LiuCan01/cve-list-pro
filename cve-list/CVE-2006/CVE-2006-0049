Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/25184

gpg in GnuPG before 1.4.2.2 does not properly verify non-detached
signatures, which allows attackers to inject unsigned data via a data
packet that is not associated with a control packet, which causes the
check for concatenated signatures to report that the signature is
valid, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0455.
