Buffer overflow in the HPDF_Page_Circle function in
hpdf_page_operator.c in Takeshi Kanno Haru Free PDF Library (libharu2,
aka libharu) 2.0.7 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) via certain arguments
that yield a large amount of PDF data, as demonstrated by a filled
circle.
