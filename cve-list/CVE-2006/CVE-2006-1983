Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in Mac OS X 10.4.6 and earlier
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
execute arbitrary code via the (1) PredictorVSetField function for
TIFF or (2) CFAllocatorAllocate function for GIF, as used in
applications that use ImageIO or AppKit.  NOTE: the BMP vector has
been re-assigned to CVE-2006-2238 because it affects a separate
product family.
