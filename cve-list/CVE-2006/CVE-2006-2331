Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in PHP-Fusion 6.00.306
allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files
via (1) a .. (dot dot) in the settings[locale] parameter in
infusions/last_seen_users_panel/last_seen_users_panel.php, and (2) a
..  (dot dot) in the localeset parameter in setup.php.  NOTE: the
vendor states that this issue might exist due to problems in third
party local files.
