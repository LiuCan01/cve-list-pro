Race condition in the Xsession script, as used by X Display Manager
(xdm) in NetBSD before 20060212, X.Org before 20060225, and Solaris 8
through 10 before 20061006, causes a user's Xsession errors file to
have weak permissions before a chmod is performed, which allows local
users to read Xsession errors files of other users.
