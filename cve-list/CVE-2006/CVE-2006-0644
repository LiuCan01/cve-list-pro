Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in install.php in
CPG-Nuke Dragonfly CMS (aka CPG Dragonfly CMS) 9.0.6.1 allow remote
attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory
traversal sequences and a NUL (%00) character in (1) the newlang
parameter and (2) the installlang parameter in a cookie, as
demonstrated by using error.php to insert malicious code into a log
file, or uploading a malicious .png file, which is then included using
install.php.
