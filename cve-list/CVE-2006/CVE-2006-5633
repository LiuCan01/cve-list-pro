Firefox 1.5.0.7 and 2.0, and Seamonkey 1.1b, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) by creating a range object using
createRange, calling selectNode on a DocType node
(DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE), then calling createContextualFragment on the
range, which triggers a null dereference.  NOTE: the original Bugtraq
post mentioned that code execution was possible, but followup analysis
has shown that it is only a null dereference.
