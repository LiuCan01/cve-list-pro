** DISPUTED **

ProFTPD 1.3.0a and earlier does not properly set the buffer size limit
when CommandBufferSize is specified in the configuration file, which
leads to an off-by-two buffer underflow.  NOTE: in November 2006, the
role of CommandBufferSize was originally associated with
CVE-2006-5815, but this was an error stemming from a vague initial
disclosure.  NOTE: ProFTPD developers dispute this issue, saying that
the relevant memory location is overwritten by assignment before
further use within the affected function, so this is not a
vulnerability.
