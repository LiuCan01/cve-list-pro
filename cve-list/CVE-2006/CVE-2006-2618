Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in (1) AlstraSoft Web Host
Directory 1.2, aka (2) HyperStop WebHost Directory 1.2, might allow
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the "write
a review" box.  NOTE: since user reviews do not require administrator
privileges, and an auto-approve mechanism exists, this issue is a
vulnerability.
