** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in admin.x-shop.php in the
x-shop component (com_x-shop) 1.7 and earlier for Mambo and Joomla!
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
by third party researchers, stating that there is no
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter and no admin.x-shop.php file in the
reported package.
