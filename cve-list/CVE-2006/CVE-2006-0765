GUI display truncation vulnerability in ICQ Inc. (formerly Mirabilis)
ICQ 2003a, 2003b, Lite 4.0, Lite 4.1, and possibly other Windows
versions allows user-assisted remote attackers to hide malicious file
extensions, bypass Windows security warnings via a filename that is
all uppercase and of a specific length, which truncates the malicious
extension from the display and could trick a user into executing
arbitrary programs.
