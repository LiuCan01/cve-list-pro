Untrusted search path vulnerability in OpenBase SQL 10.0 and earlier,
as used in Apple Xcode 2.2 2.2 and earlier and possibly other
products, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a modified
PATH that references a malicious gzip program, which is executed by
gnutar with certain TAR_OPTIONS environment variable settings, when
gnutar is invoked by OpenBase.
