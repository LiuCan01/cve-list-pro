** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in search.php in X-Cart Gold and Pro
4.0.18, and X-Cart 4.1.0 beta 1, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the "Search for pattern" field, when the
settings specify only "Search in Detailed description" and "Search
also in ISBN."  NOTE: the vendor disputed this issue in a comment on
the original researcher's blog, saying "the bug does not impose any
security threat and remote attackers can't add, modify, or delete
information in the back-end database by sending specially-crafted SQL
statements to the search.php script using various search parameters."
As of 20060605, the original blog entry is unavailable, although ISS
also reports the same dispute.  CVE has not been able to investigate
this issue further, although the researcher sometimes makes inaccurate
claims.
