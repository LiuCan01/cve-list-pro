The default configuration of Fluffington FLog 1.01 installs
users.0.dat under the web document root with insufficient access
control, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information (login credentials) via a direct request.  NOTE: It was
later reported that 1.1.2 is also affected.
