Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Your_Account module in
PHP-Nuke 7.8 might allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML
and web script via the ublock parameter, which is saved in the user's
personal menu.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown;
the details are obtained solely from third party information. In
addition, it is unclear whether this issue is a vulnerability, since
it is related to the user's personal menu, which presumably is not
modifiable by others.
