Oracle Database 8i, 9i, and 10g allow remote authenticated users to
execute arbitrary SQL statements in the context of the SYS user and
bypass audit logging, including statements to create new privileged
database accounts, via a modified AUTH_ALTER_SESSION attribute in the
authentication phase of the Transparent Network Substrate (TNS)
protocol.  NOTE: due to the lack of relevant details from the Oracle
advisory, a separate CVE is being created since it cannot be
conclusively proven that this issue has been addressed by Oracle.  It
is possible that this is the same issue as Oracle Vuln# DB18 from the
January 2006 CPU, in which case this would be subsumed by
CVE-2006-0265.
