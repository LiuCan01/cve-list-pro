spread uses a temporary file with a static filename based on the port
number, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by
creating the file during a race condition between unlink and bind
function calls.  NOTE: spread deletes this temporary file before use,
which could cause conflicts with other programs that use the same
filename, but this is not a distinct issue.
