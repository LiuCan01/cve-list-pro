admin/accounts/AccountActions.asp in Hosting Controller 2002 RC 1
allows remote attackers to modify passwords of other users, probably
via an "Update User" ActionType with a modified UserName parameter and
the PassCheck parameter set to TRUE.  It was later reported that the
vulnerability is present in 6.1 Hotfix 3.3 and earlier.
