Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/30120

Unspecified vulnerability in the sshd Privilege Separation Monitor in
OpenSSH before 4.5 causes weaker verification that authentication has
been successful, which might allow attackers to bypass authentication.
NOTE: as of 20061108, it is believed that this issue is only
exploitable by leveraging vulnerabilities in the unprivileged process,
which are not known to exist.
