PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in sipssys/code/box.inc.php in
Haakon Nilsen simple, integrated publishing system (SIPS) 0.3.1 and
earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the config[sipssys] parameter.  NOTE: the product's
documentation recommends placing the affected file outside of the web
root, so the scope of issue is limited to admins who do not, or
cannot, follow this recommendation.
