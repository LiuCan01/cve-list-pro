Multiple buffer overflows in World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Amaya
9.4, and possibly other versions including 8.x before 8.8.5, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long value in (1) the
COMPACT attribute of the COLGROUP element, (2) the ROWS attribute of
the TEXTAREA element, and (3) the COLOR attribute of the LEGEND
element; and via other unspecified attack vectors consisting of
"dozens of possible snippets."
