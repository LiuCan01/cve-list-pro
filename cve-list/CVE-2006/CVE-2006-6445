Directory traversal vulnerability in error.php in Envolution 1.1.0 and
earlier allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local
files via a .. (dot dot) in the PNSVlang (PNSV lang) parameter, as
demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log
file, which is then included by error.php.
