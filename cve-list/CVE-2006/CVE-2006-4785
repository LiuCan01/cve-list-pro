SQL injection vulnerability in blog/edit.php in Moodle 1.6.1 and
earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
the format parameter as stored in the $blogEntry variable, which is
not properly handled by the insert_record function, which calls
_adodb_column_sql in the adodb layer (lib/adodb/adodb-lib.inc.php),
which does not convert the data type to an int.
