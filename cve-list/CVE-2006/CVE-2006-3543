** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Invision Power Board (IPB)
1.x and 2.x allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
via the (1) idcat and (2) code parameters in a ketqua action in
index.php; the id parameter in a (3) Attach and (4) ref action in
index.php; the CODE parameter in a (5) Profile, (6) Login, and (7)
Help action in index.php; and the (8) member_id parameter in
coins_list.php.  NOTE: the developer has disputed this issue, stating
that the "CODE attribute is never present in an SQL query" and the
"'ketqua' [action] and file 'coin_list.php' are not standard IPB 2.x
features".  It is unknown whether these vectors are associated with an
independent module or modification of IPB.
