** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in centipaid_class.php in
CentiPaid 1.4.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
a URL in the class_pwd parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
by CVE and multiple third parties, who state that $class_pwd is set to
a static value before the relevant include statement.
