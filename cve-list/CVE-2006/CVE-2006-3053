** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in common.php in PHORUM 5.1.13
and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
a URL in the PHORUM[http_path] parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been
disputed by the vendor, who states "common.php is checked on the very
first line of non-comment code that it is not being called
directly. It has been this way in all 5.x version of Phorum."  CVE
analysis concurs with the vendor.
