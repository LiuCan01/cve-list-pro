Directory traversal vulnerability in SAP Business Connector (BC) 4.6
and 4.7 allows remote attackers to read or delete arbitrary files via
the fullName parameter to (1) sapbc/SAP/chopSAPLog.dsp or (2)
invoke/sap.monitor.rfcTrace/deleteSingle.  Details will be updated
after the grace period has ended.  NOTE: SAP Business Connector is an
OEM version of webMethods Integration Server.  webMethods states that
this issue can only occur when the product is installed as root/admin,
and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port; however,
both are discouraged in the documentation.  In addition, the attacker
must already have acquired administrative privileges through other
means.
