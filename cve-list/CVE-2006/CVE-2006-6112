LifeType 1.0.x and 1.1.x have insufficient access control for all of the PHP
scripts under (1) class/ and (2) plugins/, which allows remote attackers to
obtain the installation path via a direct request to any of the scripts, as
demonstrated by (a) bayesianfilter.class.php and (b) bootstrap.php, which
leaks the path in an error message.
