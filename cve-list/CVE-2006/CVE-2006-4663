** DISPUTED **

The source code tar archive of the Linux kernel 2.6.16, 2.6.17.11, and
possibly other versions specifies weak permissions (0666 and 0777) for
certain files and directories, which might allow local users to insert
Trojan horse source code that would be used during the next kernel
compilation.  NOTE: another researcher disputes the vulnerability,
stating that he finds "Not a single world-writable file or directory."
CVE analysis as of 20060908 indicates that permissions will only be
weak under certain unusual or insecure scenarios.
