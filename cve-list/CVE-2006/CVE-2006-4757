Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the admin section in e107
0.7.5 allow remote authenticated administrative users to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) linkopentype, (2) linkrender, (3)
link_class, and (4) link_id parameters in (a) links.php; the (5)
searchquery parameter in (b) users.php; and the (6)
download_category_class parameter in (c) download.php.  NOTE: an e107
developer has disputed the significance of the vulnerability, stating
that "If your admins are injecting you, you might want to reconsider
their access."
