e107 0.75 and earlier does not properly unset variables when the input
data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an
alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via the tinyMCE_imglib_include image/jpeg
parameter in e107_handlers/tiny_mce/plugins/ibrowser/ibrowser.php, as
demonstrated by a multipart/form-data request.  NOTE: it could be
argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP
command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so,
then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in e107.
