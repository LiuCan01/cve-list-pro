Multiple buffer overflows in libmusicbrainz (aka mb_client or
MusicBrainz Client Library) 2.1.2 and earlier, and SVN 8406 and
earlier, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or execute arbitrary code via (1) a long Location header by the HTTP
server, which triggers an overflow in the MBHttp::Download function in
lib/http.cpp; and (2) a long URL in RDF data, as demonstrated by a URL
in an rdf:resource field in an RDF XML document, which triggers
overflows in many functions in lib/rdfparse.c.
