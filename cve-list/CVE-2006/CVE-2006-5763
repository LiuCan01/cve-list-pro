Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Free File
Hosting 1.1, and possibly earlier, when register_globals is enabled,
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
AD_BODY_TEMP parameter to (1) login.php, (2) register.php, or (3)
send.php.  NOTE: the original provenance of this information is
unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
NOTE: this issue was later reported for the "File Upload System" which
is a component of Free File Hosting.  Vector 1 also affects Free Image
Hosting 2.0, which contains the same code.
