Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
pblguestbook.php in PBL Guestbook 1.31 allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via javascript in the SRC
attribute of IMG tags in the (1) name, (2) email, and (3) website
parameter, which bypasses XSS protection mechanisms that check for
SCRIPT tags but not IMG.  NOTE: portions of this description's details
are obtained from third party information.
