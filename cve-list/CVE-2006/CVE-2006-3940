Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpbb-Auction allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the ar parameter
in auction_room.php and (2) the u parameter in auction_store.php.
NOTE: the auction_rating.php vector is already covered by
CVE-2005-1234.  NOTE: the original disclosure states that the product
name is "PHP-Auction", but this is probably an error.
