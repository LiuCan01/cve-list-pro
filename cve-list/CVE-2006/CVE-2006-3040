** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in talkbox.php in Amr Talkbox
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
direct parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by CVE, since
the $direct variable is set to a static value just before the include
statement.
