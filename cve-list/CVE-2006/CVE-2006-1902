fold_binary in fold-const.c in GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) 4.1
improperly handles pointer overflow when folding a certain expr
comparison to a corresponding offset comparison in cases other than
EQ_EXPR and NE_EXPR, which might introduce buffer overflow
vulnerabilities into applications that could be exploited by
context-dependent attackers.NOTE: the vendor states that the essence
of the issue is "not correctly interpreting an offset to a pointer as
a signed value."
