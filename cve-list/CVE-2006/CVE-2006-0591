The crypt_gensalt functions for BSDI-style extended DES-based and
FreeBSD-sytle MD5-based password hashes in crypt_blowfish 0.4.7 and
earlier do not evenly and randomly distribute salts, which makes it
easier for attackers to guess passwords from a stolen password file
due to the increased number of collisions.
