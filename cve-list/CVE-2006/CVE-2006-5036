** DISPUTED **

MySource Matrix 3.8 and earlier, and MySource 2.x, allow remote
attackers to use the application as an HTTP proxy server via the
sq_remote_page_url parameter to access arbitrary sites with the
server's IP address and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
NOTE: the researcher reports that "The vendor does not consider this a
vulnerability."
