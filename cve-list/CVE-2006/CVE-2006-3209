** DISPUTED ** The Task scheduler (at.exe) on Microsoft Windows XP
spawns each scheduled process with SYSTEM permissions, which allows
local users to gain privileges.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by
third parties, who state that the Task scheduler is limited to the
Administrators group by default upon installation.
