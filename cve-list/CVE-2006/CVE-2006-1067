Linksys WRT54G routers version 5 (running VXWorks) allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a malformed DCC SEND
string to an IRC channel, which causes an IRC connection reset,
possibly related to the masquerading code for NAT environments, and as
demonstrated via (1) a DCC SEND with a single long argument, or (2) a
DCC SEND with IP, port, and filesize arguments with a 0 value.
