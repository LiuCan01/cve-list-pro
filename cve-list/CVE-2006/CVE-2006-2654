Directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs smbfs on FreeBSD 4.10 up to
6.1 allows local users to escape chroot restrictions for an
SMB-mounted filesystem via "..\" sequences.  NOTE: this is similar to
CVE-2006-1864, but this is a different implementation of smbfs, so it
has a different CVE identifier.
