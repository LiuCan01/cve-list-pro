The RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U API function in NTDLL.DLL in
Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 and XP SP2 does not properly convert DOS
style paths with trailing spaces into NT style paths, which allows
context-dependent attackers to create files that cannot be accessed
through the expected DOS path or prevent access to other similarly
named files in the same directory, which prevents those files from
being detected or disinfected by certain anti-virus and anti-spyware
software.
