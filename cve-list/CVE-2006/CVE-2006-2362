Buffer overflow in getsym in tekhex.c in libbfd in Free Software
Foundation GNU Binutils before 20060423, as used by GNU strings,
allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file
with a crafted Tektronix Hex Format (TekHex) record in which the
length character is not a valid hexadecimal character.
