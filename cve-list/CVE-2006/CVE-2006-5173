Linux kernel does not properly save or restore EFLAGS during a context
switch, or reset the flags when creating new threads, which allows
local users to cause a denial of service (process crash), as
demonstrated using a process that sets the Alignment Check flag
(EFLAGS 0x40000), which triggers a SIGBUS in other processes that have
an unaligned access.
