madvise_remove in Linux kernel 2.6.16 up to 2.6.16.6 does not follow
file and mmap restrictions, which allows local users to bypass IPC
permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with zeroes,
aka the MADV_REMOVE vulnerability.  NOTE: this description was
originally written in a way that combined two separate issues.  The
mprotect issue now has a separate name, CVE-2006-2071.
