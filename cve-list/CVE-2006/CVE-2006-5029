SQL injection vulnerability in thread.php in WoltLab Burning Board
(wBB) 2.3.x allows remote attackers to obtain the version numbers of
PHP, MySQL, and wBB via the page parameter.  NOTE: this issue might be
a forced SQL error. Also, the original report was disputed by a third
party for 2.3.3 and 2.3.4.
