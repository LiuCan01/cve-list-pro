Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 4.x and 5.x
applications, when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input
for the additional_parameters argument to the mb_send_mail function,
allows context-dependent attackers to read and create arbitrary files
by providing extra -C and -X arguments to sendmail.  NOTE: it could be
argued that this is a class of technology-specific vulnerability,
instead of a particular instance; if so, then this should not be
included in CVE.
