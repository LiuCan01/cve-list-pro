SQL injection vulnerability in the Downloads module for unknown
versions of PostNuke allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the lid parameter in a viewdownloaddetails operation.
NOTE: this issue might have been in the viewdownloaddetails function
in dl-downloaddetails.php, but PostNuke 0.764 does not appear to have
this issue.
