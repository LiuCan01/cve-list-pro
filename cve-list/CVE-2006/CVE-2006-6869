Directory traversal vulnerability in
includes/search/search_mdforum.php in MAXdev MDForum 2.0.1 and
earlier, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled and register_globals is
enabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
local files via a .. (dot dot) in the PNSVlang cookie to error.php, as
demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log
file, which is then included by error.php.
