Yazd Discussion Forum before 3.0 beta does not properly manage forum
permissions, which allows remote authenticated users to (1) reply to a
message in an arbitrary forum, if authorized to create a message in
any forum; and (2) perform certain unauthorized forum actions, related
to an "error in how the permissions were assembled" that assigns extra
permissions to users.
