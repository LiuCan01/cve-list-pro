** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in install.php3 in @cid stats
2.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the repertoire parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a
third party, who states that install.php3 is supposed to be deleted
after installation and, if not deleted, intentionally allows setting
repertoire without an inclusion attack.
