Reference: MLIST:[current-users] 20061110 [Security Fix] ptrace insufficient bounds checking
Reference: URL:http://mail-index.netbsd.org/current-users/2006/11/10/0000.html

The NetBSD-current kernel before 20061028 does not properly perform
bounds checking of an unspecified userspace parameter in the ptrace
system call during a PT_DUMPCORE request, which allows local users to
have an unknown impact.
