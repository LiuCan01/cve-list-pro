IBM Tivoli Micromuse Netcool/NeuSecure 3.0.236 stores cleartext
passwords in the (1) CMS_DBPASS, (2) CMSM_DBPASS, and (3) RPT_DBPASS
fields in /etc/neusecure.conf, and in (4)
/opt/NeuSecure/bin/ns_archiver.log, which allows local users to gain
privileges.  NOTE: IBM has privately confirmed to CVE that a fix is
available for these issues.
