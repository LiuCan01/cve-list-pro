Buffer overflow in certain Asian language versions of Microsoft Excel
might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted STYLE record in a spreadsheet that triggers the overflow when
the user attempts to repair the document or selects the "Style"
option, as demonstrated by nanika.xls.  NOTE: Microsoft has confirmed
to CVE via e-mail that this is different than the other Excel
vulnerabilities announced before 20060707, including CVE-2006-3059 and
CVE-2006-3086.
