The Independent Management Architecture (IMA) service (ImaSrv.exe) in
Citrix MetaFrame XP 1.0 and 2.0, and Presentation Server 3.0 and 4.0,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service exit)
via a crafted packet that causes the service to access an unmapped
memory address and triggers an unhandled exception.
