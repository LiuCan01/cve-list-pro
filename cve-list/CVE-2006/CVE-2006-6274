SQL injection vulnerability in articles.asp in Expinion.net iNews (1)
Publisher (iNP) 2.5 and earlier, and possibly (2) News Manager, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the ex
parameter.  NOTE: early reports of this issue reported it as XSS, but
this was erroneous.  The original report was for News Manager, but
there is strong evidence that the correct product is Publisher.
