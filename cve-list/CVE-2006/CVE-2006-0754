** DISPUTED **
dotProject 2.0.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via direct requests with an invalid baseDir to
certain PHP scripts in the db directory, which reveal the path in an
error message.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that it
could only occur if the administrator ignores the installation
instructions as well as warnings generated by check.php.
