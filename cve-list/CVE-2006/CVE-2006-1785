Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions 6.0 allows remote
authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script via a leading (1)
ftp or (2) http URI in the ReaderURL variable in the "Update Download
Site" section of ads-readerext.  NOTE: it is not clear whether the
vendor advisory addresses this issue.  In addition, since the issue
requires administrative privileges to exploit, it is not clear whether
this crosses security boundaries.
