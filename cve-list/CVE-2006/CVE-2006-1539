Multiple buffer overflows in the checkscores function in scores.c in
tetris-bsd in bsd-games before 2.17-r1 in Gentoo Linux might allow
local users with games group membership to gain privileges by
modifying tetris-bsd.scores to contain crafted executable content,
which is executed when another user launches tetris-bsd.
