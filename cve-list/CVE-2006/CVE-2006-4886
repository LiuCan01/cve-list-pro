The VirusScan On-Access Scan component in McAfee VirusScan Enterprise
7.1.0 and Scan Engine 4.4.00 allows local privileged users to bypass
security restrictions and disable the On-Access Scan option by opening
the program via the task bar and quickly clicking the Disable button,
possibly due to an interface-related race condition.
