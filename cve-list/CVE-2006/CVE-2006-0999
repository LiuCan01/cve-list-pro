The SSL server implementation in NILE.NLM in Novell NetWare 6.5 and
Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES) allows a client to force the
server to use weak encryption by stating that a weak cipher is
required for client compatibility, which might allow remote attackers
to decrypt contents of an SSL protected session.
