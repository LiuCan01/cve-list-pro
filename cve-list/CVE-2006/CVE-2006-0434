Directory traversal vulnerability in action.php in phpXplorer allows
remote attackers to read arbitrary files via ".." (dot dot) sequences
and null bytes in the sAction parameter, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2006-0244.  NOTE: if the functionality of phpXplorer supports
the upload of PHP files, then this issue would not cross privilege
boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.
