Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in Warcraft III
Replay Parser for PHP 1.8c allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via the page parameter.  NOTE: post-disclosure
analysis by CVE suggests that the "page" parameter is not used in this
product, and "id" might be the affected parameter.
