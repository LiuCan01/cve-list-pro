Directory traversal vulnerability in Jim Hu and Chad Little PHP
iCalendar 2.21 and earlier allows remote attackers to include and
execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences and a
NUL (%00) character in the phpicalendar[cookie_language] and
phpicalendar[cookie_style] cookies, as demonstrated by injecting PHP
sequences into an Apache access_log file, which is then included by
day.php.
