** DISPUTED **

QueryString.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.0.7 and earlier, and
1.1rc2 and earlier, allows remote attackers to more easily spoof the
IP address and evade banning via a modified X-Forwarded-For HTTP
header, which is preferred instead of other more reliable sources for
the IP address.  NOTE: the original researcher claims that the vendor
has disputed this issue.
