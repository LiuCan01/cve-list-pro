** DISPUTED **

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in BluePay Manager
2.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML during a login action via the (1) Account Name and (2)
Username field.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability,
saying that "it does not exist currently in the Bluepay 2.0 product,"
and older versions might not have been affected either.  As of
20060512, CVE has not formally investigated this dispute.
