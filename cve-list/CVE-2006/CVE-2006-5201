Multiple packages on Sun Solaris, including (1) NSS; (2) Java JDK and
JRE 5.0 Update 8 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.x up to 1.4.2_12, and
SDK and JRE 1.3.x up to 1.3.1_19; (3) JSSE 1.0.3_03 and earlier; (4)
IPSec/IKE; (5) Secure Global Desktop; and (6) StarOffice, when using
an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating a
hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature
that is signed by that RSA key and prevents these products from
correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1.
