** DISPUTED **

Symantec LiveState 7.1 Agent for Windows allows local users to gain
privileges by stopping the shstart.exe process and open "Web
Self-Service" from the system tray icon, which will open a browser
window running with elevated privileges.  NOTE: several third-party
researchers have noted that administrator privileges may be necessary
to terminate shstart.exe. If this is the case, then no privilege
escalation occurs, and this is not a vulnerability.
