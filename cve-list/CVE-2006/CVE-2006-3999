ISS BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpj, 3.6.cpiE, and possibly earlier
versions do not properly monitor the integrity of the pamversion.dll
BlackICE library, which allows local users to subvert BlackICE by
replacing pamversion.dll.  NOTE: in most cases, the attack would not
cross privilege boundaries because replacing pamversion.dll requires
administrative privileges. However, this issue is a vulnerability
because BlackICE is intended to protect against certain rogue
privileged actions.
