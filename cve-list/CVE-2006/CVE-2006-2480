Format string vulnerability in Dia 0.94 allows user-assisted
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code by triggering errors or warnings, as demonstrated via
format string specifiers in a .bmp filename.  NOTE: the original
exploit was demonstrated through a command line argument, but there
are other mechanisms for input that are automatically processed by
Dia, such as a crafted .dia file.
