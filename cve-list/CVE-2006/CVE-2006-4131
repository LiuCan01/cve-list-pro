Multiple buffer overflows in ArcSoft MMS Composer 1.5.5.6, and
possibly earlier, and 2.0.0.13, and possibly earlier, allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary
code via crafted MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages that
trigger the overflows in the (1) M-Notification.ind, (2)
M-Retrieve.conf (Header and Body), or (3) SMIL parsers.
