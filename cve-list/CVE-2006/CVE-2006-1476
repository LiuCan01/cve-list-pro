Windows Firewall in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 produces incorrect
application block alerts when the application filename is ".exe" (with
no characters before the "."), which might allow local user-assisted
users to trick a user into unblocking a Trojan horse program, as
demonstrated by a malicious ".exe" program in a folder named "Internet
Explorer," which triggers a question about whether to unblock the
"Internet Explorer" program.
