Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in vbPortal 3.0.2
through 3.6.0 Beta 1, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote
attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory
traversal sequences in the bbvbplang cookie, as demonstrated by
injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is
then included by index.php.
