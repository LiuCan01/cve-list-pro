** DISPUTED ** Blackboard Academic Suite 6.0 and earlier does not
properly clear session information when de-authenticating a user who
is idle, which allows subsequent users to log in as the previous user
and gain privileges.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying
that "This is a customer specific issue related to their Kerberos
authentication single sign-on application and not a vulnerability in
the Blackboard product."
