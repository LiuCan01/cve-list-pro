SQL injection vulnerability in @1 File Store 2006.03.07 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the id parameter to
(1) functions.php and (2) user.php in the libs directory, (3) edit.php
and (4) delete.php in control/files/, (5) edit.php and (6) delete.php
in control/users/, (7) edit.php, (8) access.php, and (9) in
control/folders/, (10) access.php and (11) delete.php in
control/groups/, (12) confirm.php, and (13) download.php; (14) the
email parameter in password.php, and (15) the id parameter in
folder.php.  NOTE: it was later reported that vectors 12 and 13 also
affect @1 File Store PRO 3.2.
