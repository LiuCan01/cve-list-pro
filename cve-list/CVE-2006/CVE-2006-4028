Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in WordPress before 2.0.4 have
unknown impact and remote attack vectors.  NOTE: due to lack of
details, it is not clear how these issues are different from
CVE-2006-3389 and CVE-2006-3390, although it is likely that 2.0.4
addresses an unspecified issue related to "Anyone can register"
functionality (user registration for guests).
