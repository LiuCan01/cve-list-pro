Argument injection vulnerability in Avant Browser 10.1 Build 17 allows
user-assisted remote attackers to modify command line arguments to an
invoked mail client via " (double quote) characters in a mailto:
scheme handler, as demonstrated by launching Microsoft Outlook with an
arbitrary filename as an attachment.  NOTE: it is not clear whether
this issue is implementation-specific or a problem in the Microsoft
API.
