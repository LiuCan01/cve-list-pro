choose_file.php in easy-CMS 0.1.2, when mod_mime is installed, does
not restrict uploads of filenames with multiple extensions, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a
PHP file with a GIF file extension, then directly accessing that file
in the Repositories directory.
