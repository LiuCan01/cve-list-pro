manage_user_page.php in Mantis 1.00rc4 and earlier does not properly
handle a sort parameter containing a ' (quote) character, which allows
remote attackers to trigger a SQL error that may be repeatedly
reported to a user who makes subsequent web accesses with the
MANTIS_MANAGE_COOKIE cookie.  NOTE: this issue might be the same as
vector 2 in CVE-2005-4519.
