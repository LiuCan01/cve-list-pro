Stack-based buffer overflow in the Vector Graphics Rendering engine
(vgx.dll), as used in Microsoft Outlook and Internet Explorer 6.0 on
Windows XP SP2, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via a Vector Markup Language (VML) file with
a long fill parameter within a rect tag.
