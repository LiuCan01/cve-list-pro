E-Business Designer (eBD) 3.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to
upload or modify arbitrary files, and execute arbitrary code, via a
direct request to (1) common/html_editor/image_browser.upload.html,
(2) common/html_editor/image_browser.html, or (3)
common/html_editor/html_editor.html.  NOTE: this can also be used for
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by uploading cascading style sheet
(.CSS) files.
