Oracle 10g R2 and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to
trigger internal errors, and possibly have other impacts, via an
"alter session set events" command with invalid arguments.  NOTE: this
issue was originally disputed by a third party, but the dispute was
retracted.  NOTE: this issue was called an "integer overflow" in the
original source, but this might be incorrect.
