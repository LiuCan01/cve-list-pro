** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in bug.php in Leicestershire
communityPortals 1.0 build 20051018 and earlier allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the cp_root_path
parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-5280.  NOTE: CVE disputes
this issue, since bug.php is not in communityPortals source
distributions.
