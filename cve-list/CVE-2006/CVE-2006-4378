** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the Rssxt
component for Joomla! (com_rssxt), possibly 2.0 Beta 1 or 1.0 and
earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter in (1) pinger.php, (2)
RPC.php, or (3) rssxt.php.  NOTE: another researcher has disputed this
issue, saying that the attacker can not control this parameter.  In
addition, as of 20060825, the original researcher has appeared to be
unreliable with some other past reports.  CVE has not performed any
followup analysis with respect to this issue.
