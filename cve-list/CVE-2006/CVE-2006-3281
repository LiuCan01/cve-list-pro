Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 does not properly handle Drag and Drop
events, which allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a link to an SMB file share with a filename that
contains encoded .. (%2e%2e%5c) sequences and whose extension
contains the CLSID Key identifier for HTML Applications (HTA), aka
"Folder GUID Code Execution Vulnerability."  NOTE: directory traversal
sequences were used in the original exploit, although their role is
not clear.
