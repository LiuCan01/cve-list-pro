The default configuration of the DNS Server service on Windows Server
2003 and Windows 2000, and the Microsoft DNS Server service on Windows
NT 4.0, allows recursive queries and provides additional delegation
information to arbitrary IP addresses, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via DNS queries
with spoofed source IP addresses.
