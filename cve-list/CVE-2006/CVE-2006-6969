Jetty before 4.2.27, 5.1 before 5.1.12, 6.0 before 6.0.2, and 6.1
before 6.1.0pre3 generates predictable session identifiers using
java.util.random, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess
a session identifier through brute force attacks, bypass
authentication requirements, and possibly conduct cross-site request
forgery attacks.
