Use-after-free vulnerability in Sendmail before 8.13.8 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long "header
line", which causes a previously freed variable to be referenced.
NOTE: the original developer has disputed the severity of this issue,
saying "The only denial of service that is possible here is to fill up
the disk with core dumps if the OS actually generates different core
dumps (which is unlikely)... the bug is in the shutdown code (finis())
which leads directly to exit(3), i.e., the process would terminate
anyway, no mail delivery or receiption is affected."
