Multiple memory leaks in IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Server before
6.5.5 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption
and crash) via unknown vectors related to (1) unspecified vectors
during the SSL handshake (SPR# MKIN67MQVW), (2) the stash file during
the SSL handshake (SPR# MKIN693QUT), and possibly other vectors.
NOTE: due to insufficient information in the original vendor advisory,
it is not clear whether there is an attacker role in other memory
leaks that are specified in the advisory.
