Apple Safari 2.0.3 (417.9.3) on Mac OS X 10.4.6 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via
Javascript with an infinite for loop.  NOTE: it could be argued that
this is not a vulnerability, unless it interferes with the operation
of the system outside of the scope of Safari itself.
