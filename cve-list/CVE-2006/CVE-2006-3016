Unspecified vulnerability in session.c in PHP before 5.1.3 has unknown
impact and attack vectors, related to "certain characters in session
names," including special characters that are frequently associated
with CRLF injection, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and
HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities.  NOTE: while the nature of
the vulnerability is unspecified, it is likely that this is related to
a violation of an expectation by PHP applications that the session
name is alphanumeric, as implied in the PHP manual for session_name().
