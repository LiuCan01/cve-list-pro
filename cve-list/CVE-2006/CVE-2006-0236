GUI display truncation vulnerability in Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0.2,
1.0.6, and 1.0.7 allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary
code via an attachment with a filename containing a large number of
spaces ending with a dangerous extension that is not displayed by
Thunderbird, along with an inconsistent Content-Type header, which
could be used to trick a user into downloading dangerous content by
dragging or saving the attachment.
