The winbind plugin in pppd for ppp 2.4.4 and earlier does not check
the return code from the setuid function call, which might allow local
users to gain privileges by causing setuid to fail, such as exceeding
PAM limits for the maximum number of user processes, which prevents
the winbind NTLM authentication helper from dropping privileges.
