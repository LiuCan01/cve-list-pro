flex.skl in Will Estes and John Millaway Fast Lexical Analyzer
Generator (flex) before 2.5.33 does not allocate enough memory for
grammars containing (1) REJECT statements or (2) trailing context
rules, which causes flex to generate code that contains a buffer
overflow that might allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code.
