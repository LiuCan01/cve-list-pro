Directory traversal vulnerability in A.l-Pifou 1.8p2 allows remote
attackers to read arbitrary files via ".." sequences in the
ze_langue_02 cookie, as demonstrated by using the choix_lng parameter
to choix_langue.php to indirectly set the cookie, then accessing
livre_dor.php to trigger the inclusion from inc/change_lang_ck.php,
possibly related to livre_livre.php.  NOTE: the livre_livre.php
relationship has been reported by some third party sources.
