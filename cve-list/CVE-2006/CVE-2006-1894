Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RevoBoard 1.8, as derived
from PunBB, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via a substitution cipher of the email tag, which is transformed
when the application's e-mail address obfuscator reverses the
transformation.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this is a site-specific
issue; however, the claimed codebase relationship with PunBB might be
relevant.
