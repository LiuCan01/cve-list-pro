Direct static code injection vulnerability in WordPress 2.0.2 and
earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by
inserting a carriage return and PHP code when updating a profile,
which is appended after a special comment sequence into files in (1)
wp-content/cache/userlogins/ (2) wp-content/cache/users/ which are
later included by cache.php, as demonstrated using the displayname
argument.
