Buffer overflow in Mail in Apple Mac OS X 10.4 up to 10.4.5, when
patched with Security Update 2006-001, allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a long Real Name value in an e-mail
attachment sent in AppleDouble format, which triggers the overflow
when the user double-clicks on an attachment.
