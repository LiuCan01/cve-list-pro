Stack-based buffer overflow in the Sky Software FileView ActiveX
control, as used in WinZip 10 before build 7245 and in certain other
applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
long FilePattern attribute in a WZFILEVIEW object, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2006-5198.
