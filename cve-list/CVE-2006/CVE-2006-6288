Multiple buffer overflows in Niek Albers CoolPlayer 216 and earlier
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a playlist
file with long song names, because of an overflow in the
CPL_AddPrefixedFile function in CPI_Playlist.c; (2) a skin file with
long button names, because of an overflow in the
main_skin_check_ini_value function in skin.c; and (3) a skin file with
long bitmap filenames, because of an overflow in the main_skin_open
function in skin.c.
