Reference: BUGTRAQ:20060204 (OLD) Eudora WorldMail 3.0 Windows 2000 Remote System Exploit
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/424157/100/0/threaded

Buffer overflow in cram.dll in QUALCOMM Eudora WorldMail 3.0 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP APPEND command
with a long message literal argument, as demonstrated by Worldmail.pl.
NOTE: this is a different vector and a different manipulation than
CVE-2005-4267, so it might be a different vulnerability than
CVE-2005-4267.
