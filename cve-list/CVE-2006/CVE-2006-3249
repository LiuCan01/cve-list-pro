** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in search.php in Phorum 5.1.14 and earlier
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the page
parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this report, stating "If a
non positive integer or non-integer is used for the page parameter for
a search URL, the search query will use a negative number for the
LIMIT clause. This causes the query to break, showing no results.  It
IS NOT however a sql injection error."  While the original report is
from a researcher with mixed accuracy, as of 20060703, CVE does not
have any additional information regarding this issue.
