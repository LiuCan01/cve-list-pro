The Extensions manager in Mozilla Firefox 2.0 does not properly
populate the list of local extensions, which allows attackers to
construct an extension that hides itself by finding its name in the
list and then calling RemoveElement, as demonstrated by the FFsniFF
extension.  NOTE: it was later reported that 3.0 is also affected.
