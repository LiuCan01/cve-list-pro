An unspecified Microsoft WMF parsing application, as used in Internet
Explorer 5.01 SP4 on Windows 2000 SP4, and 5.5 SP2 on Windows
Millennium, and possibly other versions, allows attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly execute code via a crafted WMF
file with a manipulated WMF header size, possibly involving an integer
overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-4560, and aka "WMF
Image Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
