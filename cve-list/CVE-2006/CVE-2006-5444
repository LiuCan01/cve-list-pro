Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/29663

Integer overflow in the get_input function in the Skinny channel
driver (chan_skinny.c) in Asterisk 1.0.x before 1.0.12 and 1.2.x
before 1.2.13, as used by Cisco SCCP phones, allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code via a certain dlen value that passes a
signed integer comparison and leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
