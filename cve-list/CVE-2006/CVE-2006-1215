Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in misc.php in Woltlab
Burning Board (wBB) 2.3.4 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via the percent parameter.  NOTE: this issue has
been disputed in a followup post, although the original disclosure
might be related to reflected XSS.
