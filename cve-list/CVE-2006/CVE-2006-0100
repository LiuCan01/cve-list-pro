Buffer overflow in NicoFTP 3.0.1.19 and earlier might allow local
users to execute arbitrary code via a long string in the "Name of
site" field of an FTP account.  NOTE: because this program executes
with the privileges of the invoking user, and because remote programs
do not normally have the ability to create or modify FTP accounts in
this program, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue
that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a
vulnerability.
