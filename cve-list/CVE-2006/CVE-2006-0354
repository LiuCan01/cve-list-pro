Cisco IOS before 12.3-7-JA2 on Aironet Wireless Access Points (WAP)
allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
(termination of packet passing or termination of client connections)
by sending the management interface a large number of spoofed ARP
packets, which creates a large ARP table that exhausts memory, aka Bug
ID CSCsc16644.
