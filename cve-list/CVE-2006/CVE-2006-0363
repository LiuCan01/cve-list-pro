The "Remember my Password" feature in MSN Messenger 7.5 stores
passwords in an encrypted format under the
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftIdentityCRLCreds registry key,
which might allow local users to obtain the original passwords via a
program that calls CryptUnprotectData, as demonstrated by the "MSN
Password Recovery.exe" program.  NOTE: it could be argued that
local-only password recovery is inherently insecure because the
decryption methods and keys must be stored somewhere on the local
system, and are thus inherently accessible with varying degrees of
effort.  Perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
