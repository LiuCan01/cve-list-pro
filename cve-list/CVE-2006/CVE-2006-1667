SQL injection vulnerability in slides.php in Eric Gerdes Crafty Syntax
Image Gallery (CSIG) (aka PHP thumbnail Photo Gallery) 3.1g and
earlier allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the limitquery_s parameter when the $projectid variable
is less than 1, which prevents the $limitquery_s from being set within
slides.php.
