An unspecified Fortinet product, possibly Fortinet28, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service via a "small synflood" to the
SMTP port (TCP port 25), as demonstrated by a 10-microsecond wait
between sending packets.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed in
followup posts that suggest that a protection feature is triggering a
RST.
