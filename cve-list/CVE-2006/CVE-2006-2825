cPanel does not automatically synchronize the PHP open_basedir
configuration directive between the main server and virtual hosts that
share physical directories, which might allow a local user to bypass
open_basedir restrictions and access other virtual hosts via a PHP
script that uses a main server URL (such as ~username) that is blocked
by the user's own open_basedir directive, but not the main server's
open_basedir directive.
