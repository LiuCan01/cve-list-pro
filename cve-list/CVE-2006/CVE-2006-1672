The installation of Cisco Transport Controller (CTC) for Cisco Optical
Networking System (ONS) 15000 series nodes adds a Java policy file
entry with a wildcard that grants the java.security.AllPermission
permission to any http URL containing "fs/LAUNCHER.jar", which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a CTC workstation, aka
bug ID CSCea25049.
