Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 and possibly other versions allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
arbitrary code by instantiating COM objects as ActiveX controls,
including (1) imskdic.dll (Microsoft IME), (2) chtskdic.dll (Microsoft
IME), and (3) msoe.dll (Outlook), which leads to memory corruption.
NOTE: it is not certain whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or
the individual DLL files.
