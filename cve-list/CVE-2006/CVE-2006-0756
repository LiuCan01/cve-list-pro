** DISPUTED **
dotProject 2.0.1 and earlier leaves (1) phpinfo.php and (2) check.php
accessible under the /docs/ directory after installation, which allows
remote attackers to obtain sensitive configuration information.  NOTE:
the vendor disputes this issue, saying that it could only occur if the
administrator ignores the installation instructions as well as
warnings generated by check.php.
