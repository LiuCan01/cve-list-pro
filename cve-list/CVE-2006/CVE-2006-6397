** DISPUTED **

Integer overflow in banner/banner.c in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD
might allow local users to modify memory via a long banner.  NOTE: CVE
and multiple third parties dispute this issue. Since banner is not
setuid, an exploit would not cross privilege boundaries in normal
operations. This issue is not a vulnerability.
