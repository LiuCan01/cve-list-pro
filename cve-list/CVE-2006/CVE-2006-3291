The web interface on Cisco IOS 12.3(8)JA and 12.3(8)JA1, as used on
the Cisco Wireless Access Point and Wireless Bridge, reconfigures
itself when it is changed to use the "Local User List Only (Individual
Passwords)" setting, which removes all security and password
configurations and allows remote attackers to access the system.
