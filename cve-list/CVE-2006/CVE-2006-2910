Buffer overflow in jetAudio 6.2.6.8330 (Basic), and possibly other
versions, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code
via an audio file (such as WMA) with long ID Tag values including (1)
Title, (2) Author, and (3) Album, which triggers the overflow in the
tooltip display string if the sound card driver is disabled or
incorrectly installed.
