Directory traversal vulnerability in the loadConfig function in
index.php in phpWebSite 0.10.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to
include arbitrary local files and execute arbitrary PHP code via the
hub_dir parameter, as demonstrated by including access_log.  NOTE: in
some cases, arbitrary remote file inclusion could be performed under
PHP 5 using an SMB share argument such as "\systemnamesharename".
