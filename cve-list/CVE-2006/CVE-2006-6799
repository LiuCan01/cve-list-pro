Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/31177

SQL injection vulnerability in Cacti 0.8.6i and earlier, when
register_argc_argv is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) second or (2) third arguments to
cmd.php.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to execute arbitrary
commands since the SQL query results are later used in the
polling_items array and popen function.
