** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in cal_config.inc.php in
Calendarix 0.7.20060401 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the calpath parameter.  NOTE: this
issue has been disputed by a third party, who says that the affected
$calpath variable is set to a constant value in the beginning of the
script. CVE concurs that the initial report is invalid.
