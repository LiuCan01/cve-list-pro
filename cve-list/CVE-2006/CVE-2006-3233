Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in openwebmail-read.pl in
Open WebMail (OWM) 2.52, and other versions released before
06/18/2006, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the from field.  NOTE: some third party sources have
mentioned the "to" and "from" fields, although CVE analysis shows that
these are associated with the previous version, a different
executable, and a different CVE.
