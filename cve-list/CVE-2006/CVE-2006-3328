new_ticket.cgi in Hostflow 2.2.1-15 allows remote attackers to steal
and replay authentication credentials via an IMG tag in the desc
parameter ("Ticket Description" field) that points to a URL that
captures referer URLs, possibly due to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability or a leak of credentials in referer URLs.
