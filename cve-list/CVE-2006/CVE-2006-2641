** UNVERIFIABLE **

NOTE: this issue does not contain any verifiable or actionable
details.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in John Frank Asset
Manager (AssetMan) 2.4a and earlier allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via "any of its input."  NOTE: the
original disclosure is based on vague researcher claims without vendor
acknowledgement; therefore this identifier cannot be linked with any
future identifier that identifies more specific vectors.  Perhaps this
should not be included in CVE.
