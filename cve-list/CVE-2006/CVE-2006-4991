RSA Keon Certificate Authority (KeonCA) Manager 6.5.1 and 6.6 allows
privileged local users to hide malicious Certificate Authority (CA)
activities by modifying CA auditor logs without detection by (1)
modifying or deleting a <LOG BLOCK> and its signature from the XML log
in a way that is not detected by the integrity check function that
operates on the entire pool, or (2) modifying entries in the live log
file, which is only signed during rotation.
