Eval injection vulnerability in index.php in ClanSys 1.1 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via PHP code in the page
parameter, as demonstrated by using an "include" statement that is
injected into the eval statement.  NOTE: this issue has been described
as file inclusion by some sources, but that is just one attack; the
primary vulnerability is eval injection.
