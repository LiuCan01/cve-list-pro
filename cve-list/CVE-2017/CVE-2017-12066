Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in aggregate_graphs.php in
Cacti before 1.1.16 allows remote authenticated users to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via specially crafted HTTP Referer
headers, related to the $cancel_url variable. NOTE: this vulnerability
exists because of an incomplete fix (lack of the htmlspecialchars
ENT_QUOTES flag) for CVE-2017-11163.
