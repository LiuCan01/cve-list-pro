An issue was discovered in St. Jude Medical Merlin@home, versions prior
to Version 8.2.2 (RF models: EX1150; Inductive models: EX1100; and
Inductive models: EX1100 with MerlinOnDemand capability). The
identities of the endpoints for the communication channel between the
transmitter and St. Jude Medical's web site, Merlin.net, are not
verified. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to access or
influence communications between the identified endpoints.
