A vulnerability in motherboard console ports of line cards for Cisco
ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco cBR-8 Converged
Broadband Routers could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to
access an affected device's operating system. The vulnerability exists
because an engineering console port is available on the motherboard of
the affected line cards. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by physically connecting to the console port on the line card. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full access to the
affected device's operating system. This vulnerability affects only
Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers that have removable line cards and Cisco
cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers, if they are running certain Cisco
IOS XE 3.16 through 16.5 releases. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc65866,
CSCve77132.
