In libavformat/mov.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in read_tfra() due to lack
of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory
consumption. When a crafted MOV file, which claims a large "item_count"
field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is
provided, the loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since
there is no EOF check inside the loop.
