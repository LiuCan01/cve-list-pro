In the "Diary with lock" (aka WriteDiary) application 4.72 for Android,
neither HTTPS nor other encryption is used for transmitting data,
despite the documentation that the product is intended for "a personal
journal of ... secrets and feelings," which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network during
LoginActivity or NoteActivity execution.
