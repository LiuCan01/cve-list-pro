This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.0.14878. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the AFParseDateEx function. The issue
results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior
to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current
process. Was ZDI-CAN-4816.
