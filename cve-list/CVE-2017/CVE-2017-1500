A Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the
authorization function exposed by RESTful Web Api of IBM Worklight
Framework 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0. The vulnerable parameter
is "scope"; if you set as its value a "realm" not defined in
authenticationConfig.xml, you get an HTTP 403 Forbidden response and
the value will be reflected in the body of the HTTP response. By
setting it to arbitrary JavaScript code it is possible to modify the
flow of the authorization function, potentially leading to credential
disclosure within a trusted session.
