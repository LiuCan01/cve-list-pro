Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in EPESI
1.8.1.1. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data (tooltip_id, callback, args, cid) passed to the
EPESI-master/modules/Utils/Tooltip/req.php URL. An attacker could
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of
the vulnerable website.
