An Incorrect Default Permissions issue was discovered in Schneider
Electric Wonderware InduSoft Web Studio v8.0 Patch 3 and prior
versions. Upon installation, Wonderware InduSoft Web Studio creates a
new directory and two files, which are placed in the system's path and
can be manipulated by non-administrators. This could allow an
authenticated user to escalate his or her privileges.
