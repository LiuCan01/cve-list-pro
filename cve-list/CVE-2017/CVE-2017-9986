The intr function in sound/oss/msnd_pinnacle.c in the Linux kernel
through 4.11.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(over-boundary access) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
changing the value of a message queue head pointer between two kernel
reads of that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability.
