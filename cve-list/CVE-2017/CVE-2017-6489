Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in EPESI
1.8.1.1. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data (element, state, cat, id, cid) passed to the
EPESI-master/modules/Utils/Watchdog/subscribe.php URL. An attacker
could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the
context of the vulnerable website.
