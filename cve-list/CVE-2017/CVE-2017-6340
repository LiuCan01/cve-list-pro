Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 before
CP 1746 does not sanitize a rest/commonlog/report/template name field,
which allows a 'Reports Only' user to inject malicious JavaScript while
creating a new report. Additionally, IWSVA implements incorrect access
control that allows any authenticated, remote user (even with low
privileges like 'Auditor') to create or modify reports, and
consequently take advantage of this XSS vulnerability. The JavaScript
is executed when victims visit reports or auditlog pages.
