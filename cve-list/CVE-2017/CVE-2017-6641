A vulnerability in the TCP connection handling functionality of Cisco
Remote Expert Manager Software 11.0.0 could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to disable TCP ports and cause a denial of service
(DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to a
lack of rate-limiting functionality in the TCP Listen application of
the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a crafted TCP traffic stream in which specific types of TCP
packets are flooded to an affected device, for example a TCP packet
stream in which the TCP FIN bit is set in all the TCP packets. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause certain TCP
listening ports on the affected system to stop accepting incoming
connections for a period of time or until the affected device is
restarted, resulting in a DoS condition. In addition, system resources,
such as CPU and memory, could be exhausted during the attack. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCva29806.
