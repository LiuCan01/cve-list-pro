The tokenizer in QPDF 6.0.0 and 7.0.b1 is recursive for arrays and
dictionaries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (stack consumption and segmentation fault) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a PDF document with a deep data structure,
as demonstrated by a crash in QPDFObjectHandle::parseInternal in
libqpdf/QPDFObjectHandle.cc.
