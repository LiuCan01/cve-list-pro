Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path
switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data()
calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send()
calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which
leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU,
copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and
the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation
and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can
exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become
negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds.
A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in
e89e9cf539a2 ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18
2005.
