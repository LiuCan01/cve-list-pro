A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Jabber
for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user
of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a
malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow
the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvf79080, CSCvf79088.
