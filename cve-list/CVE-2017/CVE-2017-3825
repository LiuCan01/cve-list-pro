A vulnerability in the ICMP ingress packet processing of Cisco
TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the TelePresence endpoint to
reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation for the size of
a received ICMP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a crafted ICMP packet to the local IP address of the targeted
endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS
of the TelePresence endpoint, during which time calls could be dropped.
This vulnerability would affect either IPv4 or IPv6 ICMP traffic. This
vulnerability affects the following Cisco TelePresence products when
running software release CE8.1.1, CE8.2.0, CE8.2.1, CE8.2.2, CE 8.3.0,
or CE8.3.1: Spark Room OS, TelePresence DX Series, TelePresence MX
Series, TelePresence SX Quick Set Series, TelePresence SX Series. Cisco
Bug IDs: CSCvb95396.
