An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This issue is
due to an untrusted pointer dereference. In this scenario, the input is
crafted in way that the computation results in pointers to memory
locations that do not belong to the relevant process address space. The
dereferencing operation is a read operation, and an attack can result
in sensitive data exposure.
