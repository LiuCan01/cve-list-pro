A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of legacy Cisco ASA
5500 Series (ASA 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, and 5550) devices could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information,
aka a Return of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat (ROBOT) attack. An
attacker could iteratively query a server running a vulnerable TLS
stack implementation to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow
decryption of previously captured TLS sessions. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvg97652.
