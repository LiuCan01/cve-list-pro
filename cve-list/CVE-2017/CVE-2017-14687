Artifex MuPDF 1.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted .xps file, related
to "Data from Faulting Address controls Branch Selection starting at
mupdf+0x000000000016cb4f" on Windows. This occurs because of
mishandling of XML tag name comparisons.
