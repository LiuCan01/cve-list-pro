An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT
packet parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially
crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds
memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial
of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet
over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
