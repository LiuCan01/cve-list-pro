dde-daemon, the daemon process of DDE (Deepin Desktop Environment) 15.0
through 15.3, runs with root privileges and hardly does anything to
identify the user who calls the function through D-Bus. Anybody can
change the grub config, even to append some arguments to make a
backdoor or privilege escalation, by calling DoWriteGrubSettings()
provided by dde-daemon.
