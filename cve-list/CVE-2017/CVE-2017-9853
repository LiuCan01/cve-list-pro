** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. All inverters have a very weak password policy for the user
and installer password. No complexity requirements or length
requirements are set. Also, strong passwords are impossible due to a
maximum of 12 characters and a limited set of characters. NOTE: the
vendor reports that the 12-character limit provides "a very high
security standard." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny
Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
