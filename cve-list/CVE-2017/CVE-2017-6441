** DISPUTED ** The _zval_get_long_func_ex in Zend/zend_operators.c in
PHP 7.1.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and application crash) via crafted use of "declare(ticks="
in a PHP script. NOTE: the vendor disputes the classification of this
as a vulnerability, stating "Please do not request CVEs for ordinary
bugs. CVEs are relevant for security issues only."
