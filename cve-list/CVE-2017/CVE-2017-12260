A vulnerability in the implementation of Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) functionality in Cisco Small Business SPA50x, SPA51x, and SPA52x
Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause an affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial
of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the improper
handling of SIP request messages by an affected device. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by using formatted specifiers in a SIP
payload that is sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to cause the affected device to become unresponsive,
resulting in a DoS condition that persists until the device is
restarted manually. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business
SPA50x, SPA51x, and SPA52x Series IP Phones that are running firmware
release 7.6.2SR1 or earlier. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc63986.
