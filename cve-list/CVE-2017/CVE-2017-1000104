The Config File Provider Plugin is used to centrally manage
configuration files that often include secrets, such as passwords.
Users with only Overall/Read access to Jenkins were able to access
URLs directly that allowed viewing these files. Access to view these
files now requires sufficient permissions to configure the provided
files, view the configuration of the folder in which the configuration
files are defined, or have Job/Configure permissions to a job able to
use these files.
