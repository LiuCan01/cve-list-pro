A vulnerability in the file-download feature of the web user interface
for Cisco FindIT Network Probe Software 1.0.0 could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to download and view any system file by
using the affected software. The vulnerability is due to the absence of
role-based access control (RBAC) for file-download requests that are
sent to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected
software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download and
view any system file by using the affected software. Cisco Bug IDs:
