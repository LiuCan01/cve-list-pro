In EMC VNX2 versions prior to OE for File 8.1.9.211 and VNX1 versions
prior to OE for File 7.1.80.8, an unauthenticated remote attacker may
be able to elevate their permissions to root through a command
injection. This may potentially be exploited by an attacker to run
arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the targeted VNX Control
Station system, aka remote code execution.
