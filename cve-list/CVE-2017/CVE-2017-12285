A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Network Analysis Module
Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to delete
arbitrary files from an affected system, aka Directory Traversal. The
vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform
proper input validation of HTTP requests that it receives and the
software does not apply role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested
HTTP URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the affected
system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf41365.
