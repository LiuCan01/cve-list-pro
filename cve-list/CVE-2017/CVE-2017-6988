An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. macOS before
10.12.5 is affected. The issue involves the "802.1X" component. It
allows remote attackers to discover the network credentials of
arbitrary users by operating a crafted network that requires 802.1X
authentication, because EAP-TLS certificate validation mishandles
certificate changes.
