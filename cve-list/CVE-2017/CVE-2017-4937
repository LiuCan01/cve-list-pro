VMware Workstation (12.x before 12.5.8) and Horizon View Client for
Windows (4.x before 4.6.1) contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability
in JPEG2000 parser in the TPView.dll. On Workstation, this may allow a
guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS
that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon View Client, this may
allow a View desktop to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on
the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client. Exploitation is only
possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not
enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on
Horizon View Client.
