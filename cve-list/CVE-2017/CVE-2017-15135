It was found that 389-ds-base since 1.3.6.1 up to and including
1.4.0.3 did not always handle internal hash comparison operations
correctly during the authentication process. A remote, unauthenticated
attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass the authentication
process under very rare and specific circumstances.
