The print_insn_score32 function in opcodes/score7-dis.c:552 in GNU
Binutils 2.28 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling
of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
