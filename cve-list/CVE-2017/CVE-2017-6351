The WePresent WiPG-1500 device with firmware 1.0.3.7 has a manufacturer
account that has a hardcoded username / password. Once the device is
set to DEBUG mode, an attacker can connect to the device using the
telnet protocol and log into the device with the 'abarco' hardcoded
manufacturer account. This account is not documented, nor is the DEBUG
feature or the use of telnetd on port tcp/5885.
