A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco UCS Director 6.0.0.0 and
6.0.0.1 could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute
arbitrary workflow items with just an end-user profile, a Privilege
Escalation Vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to improper
role-based access control (RBAC) after the Developer Menu is enabled
in Cisco UCS Director. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
enabling Developer Mode for his/her user profile with an end-user
profile and then adding new catalogs with arbitrary workflow items to
his/her profile. An exploit could allow an attacker to perform any
actions defined by these workflow items, including actions affecting
other tenants. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb64765.
