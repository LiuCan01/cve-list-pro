In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured
with different authentication providers on different ports one of
which is an HTTP port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote
unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using an
authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The
attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication
provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed
port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access,
default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or
similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports
are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.
