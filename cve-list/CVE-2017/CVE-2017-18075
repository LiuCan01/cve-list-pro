Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.14.13

crypto/pcrypt.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.13 mishandles freeing
instances, allowing a local user able to access the AF_ALG-based AEAD
interface (CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_AEAD) and pcrypt
(CONFIG_CRYPTO_PCRYPT) to cause a denial of service (kfree of an
incorrect pointer) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
executing a crafted sequence of system calls.
