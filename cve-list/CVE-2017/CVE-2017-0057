DNS client in Microsoft Windows 8.1; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows
RT 8.1; Windows 10 Gold, 1511, and 1607; and Windows Server 2016 fails
to properly process DNS queries, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via (1) convincing a workstation user to
visit an untrusted webpage or (2) tricking a server into sending a DNS
query to a malicious DNS server, aka "Windows DNS Query Information
Disclosure Vulnerability."
