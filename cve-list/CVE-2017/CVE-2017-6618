A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management
Controller (IMC) 3.0(1c) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is
due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected
software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an
authenticated user of the web-based GUI on an affected system to follow
a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the web-based GUI on the
affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14587.
