A Null Pointer Dereference issue was discovered in Schneider Electric
Wonderware ArchestrA Logger, versions 2017.426.2307.1 and prior. The
null pointer dereference vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash
the logger process, causing a denial of service for logging and
log-viewing (applications that use the Wonderware ArchestrA Logger
continue to run when the Wonderware ArchestrA Logger service is
unavailable).
