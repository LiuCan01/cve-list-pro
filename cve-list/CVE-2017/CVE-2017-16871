** DISPUTED ** The UpdraftPlus plugin through 1.13.12 for WordPress
allows remote PHP code execution because the plupload_action function
in /wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/admin.php has a race condition
before deleting a file associated with the name parameter. NOTE: the
vendor reports that this does not cross a privilege boundary.
