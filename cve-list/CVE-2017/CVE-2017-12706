A stack-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in Advantech
WebAccess versions prior to V8.2_20170817. Researchers have identified
multiple vulnerabilities where there is a lack of proper validation of
the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based
buffer, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code under
the context of the process.
