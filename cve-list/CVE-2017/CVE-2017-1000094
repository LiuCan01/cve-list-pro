Docker Commons Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to
allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use to
authenticate with a Docker Registry. This functionality did not check
permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a
list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
