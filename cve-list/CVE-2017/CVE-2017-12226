A vulnerability in the web-based Wireless Controller GUI of Cisco IOS
XE Software for Cisco 5760 Wireless LAN Controllers, Cisco Catalyst
4500E Supervisor Engine 8-E (Wireless) Switches, and Cisco New
Generation Wireless Controllers (NGWC) 3850 could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to elevate their privileges on an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input
validation of HTTP requests by the affected GUI, if the GUI connection
state or protocol changes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by authenticating to the Wireless Controller GUI as a Lobby
Administrator user of an affected device and subsequently changing the
state or protocol for their connection to the GUI. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to elevate their privilege level to
administrator and gain full control of the affected device. This
vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running
Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.7.0E, 3.7.1E, 3.7.2E, 3.7.3E, 3.7.4E,
or 3.7.5E: Cisco 5760 Wireless LAN Controllers, Cisco Catalyst 4500E
Supervisor Engine 8-E (Wireless) Switches, Cisco New Generation
Wireless Controllers (NGWC) 3850. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd73746.
