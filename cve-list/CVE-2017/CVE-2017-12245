A vulnerability in SSL traffic decryption for Cisco Firepower Threat
Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to cause depletion of system memory, aka a Firepower Detection Engine
SSL Decryption Memory Consumption Denial of Service vulnerability. If
this memory leak persists over time, a denial of service (DoS)
condition could develop because traffic can cease to be forwarded
through the device. The vulnerability is due to an error in how the
Firepower Detection Snort Engine handles SSL traffic decryption and
notifications to and from the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
handler. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
steady stream of malicious Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) traffic through
the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS
condition when the device runs low on system memory. This vulnerability
affects Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software Releases 6.0.1
and later, running on any of the following Cisco products: Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls,
Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances, Firepower 4100 Series
Security Appliances, Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances. Cisco
Bug IDs: CSCve02069.
