arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.5, when nested
virtualisation is used, does not properly traverse guest pagetable
entries to resolve a guest virtual address, which allows L1 guest OS
users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS or cause a denial of
service (incorrect index during page walking, and host OS crash), aka
an "MMU potential stack buffer overrun."
