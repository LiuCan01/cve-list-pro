An issue was discovered in Teluu pjproject (pjlib and pjlib-util) in
PJSIP before 2.7.1. Parsing the numeric header fields in a SIP message
(like cseq, ttl, port, etc.) all had the potential to overflow, either
causing unintended values to be captured or, if the values were
subsequently converted back to strings, a buffer overrun. This will
lead to a potential exploit using carefully crafted invalid values.
