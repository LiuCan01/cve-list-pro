VCM5010 with software versions earlier before V100R002C50SPC100 has an
authentication bypass vulnerability. This is due to improper
implementation of authentication for accessing web pages. An
unauthenticated attacker could bypass the authentication by sending a
crafted HTTP request. 5010 with software versions earlier before
V100R002C50SPC100 has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The
software does not validate the files that uploaded. An authenticated
attacker could upload arbitrary files to the system.
