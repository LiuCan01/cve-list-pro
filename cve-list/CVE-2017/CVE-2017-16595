This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
information on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise
Manager 7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to
exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can
be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.export_005fdownload_jsp servlet, which
listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the filename
parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path
prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in
conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context
of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5118.
