The SMI-S service in Dell Storage Manager versions earlier than 16.3.20
(aka 2016 R3.20) is protected using a hard-coded password. A remote
user with the knowledge of the password might potentially disable the
SMI-S service via HTTP requests, affecting storage management and
monitoring functionality via the SMI-S interface. This issue, aka
DSM-30415, only affects a Windows installation of the Data Collector
(not applicable to the virtual appliance).
