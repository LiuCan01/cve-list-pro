The lazy_initialize function in lib/resolv.rb in Ruby through 2.4.3
uses Kernel#open, which might allow Command Injection attacks, as
demonstrated by a Resolv::Hosts::new argument beginning with a '|'
character, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-17405. NOTE:
situations with untrusted input may be highly unlikely.
