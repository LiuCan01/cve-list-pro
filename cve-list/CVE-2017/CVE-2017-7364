In all Qualcomm products with Android releases from CAF using the
Linux kernel, in function __mdss_fb_copy_destscaler_data(), variable
ds_data[i].scale may still point to a user-provided address (which
could point to arbitrary kernel address), so on an error condition,
this user-provided address will be freed (arbitrary free), and
continued operation could result in use after free condition.
