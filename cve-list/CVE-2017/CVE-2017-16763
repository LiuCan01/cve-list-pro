An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality
in config.py in Confire 0.2.0. Due to the user-specific configuration
being loaded from "~/.confire.yaml" using the yaml.load function, a
YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command
execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger
this vulnerability.
