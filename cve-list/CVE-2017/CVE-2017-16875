An issue was discovered in Teluu pjproject (pjlib and pjlib-util) in
PJSIP before 2.7.1. The ioqueue component may issue a double key
unregistration after an attacker initiates a socket connection with
specific settings and sequences. Such double key unregistration will
trigger an integer overflow, which may cause ioqueue backends to reject
future key registrations.
