A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco
Smart Net Total Care (SNTC) Software Collector Appliance 3.11 could
allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a read-only, blind
SQL injection attack, which could allow the attacker to compromise the
confidentiality of the system through SQL timing attacks. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain
user-supplied fields that are subsequently used by the affected
software to build SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by submitting crafted URLs, which are designed to exploit
the vulnerability, to the affected software. To execute an attack
successfully, the attacker would need to submit a number of requests to
the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
determine the presence of values in the SQL database of the affected
software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf07617.
