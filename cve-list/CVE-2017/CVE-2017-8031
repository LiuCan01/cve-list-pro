An issue was discovered in Cloud Foundry Foundation cf-release (all
versions prior to v279) and UAA (30.x versions prior to 30.6, 45.x
versions prior to 45.4, 52.x versions prior to 52.1). In some cases,
the UAA allows an authenticated user for a particular client to revoke
client tokens for other users on the same client. This occurs only if
the client is using opaque tokens or JWT tokens validated using the
check_token endpoint. A malicious actor could cause denial of service.
