An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality
in the YAMLParser method in Interfaces.py in PyAnyAPI before 0.6.1. A
YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command
execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used.
An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this
vulnerability.
