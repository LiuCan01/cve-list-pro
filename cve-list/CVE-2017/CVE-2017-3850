A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI)
feature of Cisco IOS Software (15.4 through 15.6) and Cisco IOS XE
Software (3.7 through 3.18, and 16) could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation on certain crafted
packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted IPv6 packet to a device that is running a Cisco IOS Software or
Cisco IOS XE Software release that supports the ANI feature. A device
must meet two conditions to be affected by this vulnerability: (1) the
device must be running a version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE
Software that supports ANI (regardless of whether ANI is configured);
and (2) the device must have a reachable IPv6 interface. An exploit
could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload. Cisco
