The getvalue function in tekhex.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer
over-read and application crash) via a crafted tekhex file, as
demonstrated by mishandling within the nm program.
