In Kibana X-Pack security versions prior to 5.4.3 if a Kibana user
opens a crafted Kibana URL the result could be a redirect to an
improperly initialized Kibana login screen. If the user enters
credentials on this screen, the credentials will appear in the URL
bar. The credentials could then be viewed by untrusted parties or
logged into the Kibana access logs.
