** DISPUTED ** Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 has a weak default password
for the secure vault, which makes it easier for physically proximate
attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism by leveraging
knowledge of the password algorithm and the appliance serial number.
NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a
vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for
supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however, a password
change is optional to meet different customers' needs.
