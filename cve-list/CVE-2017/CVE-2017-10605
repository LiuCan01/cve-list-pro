On all vSRX and SRX Series devices, when the DHCP or DHCP relay is
configured, specially crafted packet might cause the flowd process to
crash, halting or interrupting traffic from flowing through the
device(s). Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an
extended denial of service condition for the device(s). If the device
is configured in high-availability, the RG1+ (data-plane) will
fail-over to the secondary node. If the device is configured in
stand-alone, there will be temporary traffic interruption until the
flowd process is restored automatically. Sustained crafted packets may
cause the secondary failover node to fail back, or fail completely,
potentially halting flowd on both nodes of the cluster or causing
flip-flop failovers to occur. No other Juniper Networks products or
platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper
Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67 on vSRX or SRX Series;
12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D50 on vSRX or SRX Series; 15.1X49 prior to
15.1X49-D91, 15.1X49-D100 on vSRX or SRX Series.
