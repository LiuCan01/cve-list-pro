An issue was discovered in Schneider Electric Tableau Server/Desktop
Versions 7.0 to 10.1.3 in Wonderware Intelligence Versions 2014R3 and
prior. These versions contain a system account that is installed by
default. The default system account is difficult to configure with
non-default credentials after installation, and changing the default
credentials in the embedded Tableau Server is not documented. If
Tableau Server is used with Windows integrated security (Active
Directory), the software is not vulnerable. However, when Tableau
Server is used with local authentication mode, the software is
vulnerable. The default system account could be used to gain
unauthorized access.
