The server daemons in Kannel 1.5.0 and earlier create a PID file after
dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local
users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root
account for PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill
`cat /pathname`" command, as demonstrated by bearerbox.
