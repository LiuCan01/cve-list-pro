A use-after-free issue could be triggered remotely in the SFTP
component of PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729. This issue could be triggered
prior to authentication. The PSFTPd server did not automatically
restart, which enabled attackers to perform a very effective DoS
attack against this service. By sending a crafted SSH identification /
version string to the server, a NULL pointer dereference could be
caused, apparently because of a race condition in the window message
handling, performing the cleanup for invalid connections. This
incorrect cleanup code has a use-after-free.
