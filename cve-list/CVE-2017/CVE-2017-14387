The NFS service in EMC Isilon OneFS 8.1.0.0, 8.0.1.0 - 8.0.1.1, and
8.0.0.0 - 8.0.0.4 maintains default NFS export settings (including the
NFS export security flavor for authentication) that can be leveraged by
current and future NFS exports. This NFS service contained a flaw that
did not properly propagate changes made to the default security flavor
to all new and existing NFS exports that are configured to use default
NFS export settings and that are mounted after those changes are made.
This flaw may potentially allow NFS clients to access affected NFS
exports using the default and potentially weaker security flavor even
if a more secure one was selected to be used by the OneFS
administrator, aka an "NFS Export Security Setting Fallback
Vulnerability."
