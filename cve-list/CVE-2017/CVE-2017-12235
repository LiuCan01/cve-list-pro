A vulnerability in the implementation of the PROFINET Discovery and
Configuration Protocol (PN-DCP) for Cisco IOS 12.2 through 15.6 could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device
to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to the improper parsing of ingress PN-DCP Identify
Request packets destined to an affected device. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PN-DCP Identify Request
packet to an affected device and then continuing to send normal PN-DCP
Identify Request packets to the device. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in
a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are
configured to process PROFINET messages. Beginning with Cisco IOS
Software Release 12.2(52)SE, PROFINET is enabled by default on all the
base switch module and expansion-unit Ethernet ports. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCuz47179.
