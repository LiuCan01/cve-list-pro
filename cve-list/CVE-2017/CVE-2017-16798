Reference: MISC:https://github.com/bsmali4/cve/blob/master/CMS%20Made%20Simple%20UPLOAD%20FILE%20XSS.md

In CMS Made Simple 2.2.3.1, the is_file_acceptable function in
modules/FileManager/action.upload.php only blocks file extensions that
begin or end with a "php" substring, which allows remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions or trigger XSS via other
extensions, as demonstrated by .phtml, .pht, .html, or .svg.
