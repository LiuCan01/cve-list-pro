An issue was discovered on Accellion FTA devices before FTA_9_12_180.
By sending a POST request to
home/seos/courier/web/wmProgressstat.html.php with an attacker domain
in the acallow parameter, the device will respond with an
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header allowing the attacker to have site
access with a bypass of the Same Origin Policy.
