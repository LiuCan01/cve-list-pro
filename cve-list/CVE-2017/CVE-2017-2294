Reference: CONFIRM:https://puppet.com/security/cve/cve-2017-2294

Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 failed to
mark MCollective server private keys as sensitive (a feature added in
Puppet 4.6), so key values could be logged and stored in PuppetDB.
These releases use the sensitive data type to ensure this won't happen
anymore.
