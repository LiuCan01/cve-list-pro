This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
information on vulnerable installations of Netgain Enterprise Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The
specific flaw exists within heapdumps.jsp. The issue results from the
lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to
download heap memory dump. An attacker can leverage this in
conjunction with other vulnerabilities to disclose sensitive
information in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-4718.
