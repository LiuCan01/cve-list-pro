Heap-based buffer overflow in Actian Pervasive PSQL v12.10 and Zen v13
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted traffic
to TCP port 1583. The overflow occurs after Server-Client
encryption-key exchange. The issue results from an integer underflow
that leads to a zero-byte allocation. The _srvLnaConnectMP1 function is
affected.
