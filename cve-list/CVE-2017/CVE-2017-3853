A vulnerability in the Data-in-Motion (DMo) process installed with the
Cisco IOx application environment could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to cause a stack overflow that could allow remote code
execution with root privileges in the virtual instance running on an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds
checking in the DMo process. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted packets that are forwarded to the DMo
process for evaluation. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited
to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that
is hosting Cisco IOx. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco
800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers: Cisco IR809 and
Cisco IR829. Cisco IOx Releases 1.0.0.0 and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable.
Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy52330.
