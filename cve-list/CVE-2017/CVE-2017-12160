It was found that Keycloak oauth would permit an authenticated
resource to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the
authentication server, permitting indefinite usage in the case of
permission revocation. An attacker on an already compromised resource
could use this flaw to grant himself continued permissions and
possibly conduct further attacks.
