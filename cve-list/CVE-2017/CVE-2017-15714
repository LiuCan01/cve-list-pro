Reference: MLIST:[user] 20180103 [SECURITY] CVE-2017-15714 Apache OFBiz BIRT code vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://s.apache.org/UO3W

The BIRT plugin in Apache OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.03 does not escape
user input property passed. This allows for code injection by passing
that code through the URL. For example by appending this code
"__format=%27;alert(%27xss%27)" to the URL an alert window would
execute.
