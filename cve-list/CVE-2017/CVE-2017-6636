A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration
Provisioning Software (prior to Release 11.1) could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to view any file on an affected system.
The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform
proper input validation of HTTP requests and fails to apply role-based
access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that uses
directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file
location on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to view any file on the system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc99604.
