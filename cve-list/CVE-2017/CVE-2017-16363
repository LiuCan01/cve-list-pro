An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The
vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the module that
handles character codes for certain textual representations. Invalid
input leads to a computation where the pointer arithmetic results in a
location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An
attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap
addresses, etc.
