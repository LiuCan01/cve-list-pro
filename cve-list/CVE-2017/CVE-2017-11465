The parser_yyerror function in the UTF-8 parser in Ruby 2.4.1 allows
attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write or read) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Ruby script,
related to the parser_tokadd_utf8 function in parse.y. NOTE: this might
have security relevance as a bypass of a $SAFE protection mechanism.
