The restore_tqb_pixels function in hevc_filter.c in libavcodec, as used
in libbpg 0.9.7 and other products, miscalculates a memcpy destination
address, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact.
