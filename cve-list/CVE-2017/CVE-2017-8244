In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF
using the Linux kernel, variable "dbg_buf", "dbg_buf->curr" and
"dbg_buf->filled_size" could be modified by different threads at the
same time, but they are not protected with mutex or locks. Buffer
overflow is possible on race conditions. "buffer->curr" itself could
also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of
kernel memory (for write).
