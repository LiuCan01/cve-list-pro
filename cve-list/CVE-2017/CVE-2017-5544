An issue was discovered on FiberHome Fengine S5800 switches V210R240.
An unauthorized attacker can access the device's SSH service, using a
password cracking tool to establish SSH connections quickly. This will
trigger an increase in the SSH login timeout (each of the login
attempts will occupy a connection slot for a longer time). Once this
occurs, legitimate login attempts via SSH/telnet will be refused,
resulting in a denial of service; you must restart the device.
