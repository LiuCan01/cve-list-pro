An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa
Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. By connecting to the Mosquitto broker on
an access point and one of its clients, an attacker can gather enough
information to craft a command that reboots the client remotely when
sent to the client's Mosquitto broker, aka "unauthenticated remote
command execution." This command can be re-sent endlessly to act as a
DoS attack on the client.
