VMware Workstation (14.x before 14.1.0 and 12.x) and Horizon View
Client (4.x before 4.7.0) contain an out-of-bounds read vulnerability
in TPView.dll. On Workstation, this issue in conjunction with other
bugs may allow a guest to leak information from host or may allow for
a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the
case of a Horizon View Client, this issue in conjunction with other
bugs may allow a View desktop to leak information from host or may
allow for a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon
View Client. Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has
been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation
but it is enabled by default on Horizon View.
