Name: CVE-2017-1000481
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000481
Phase: Assigned (20180103)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20171128/open-redirection-on-login-form

When you visit a page where you need to login, Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 sends
you to the login form with a 'came_from' parameter set to the previous
url. After you login, you get redirected to the page you tried to view
before. An attacker might try to abuse this by letting you click on a
specially crafted link. You would login, and get redirected to the
site of the attacker, letting you think that you are still on the
original Plone site. Or some javascript of the attacker could be
executed. Most of these types of attacks are already blocked by Plone,
using the `isURLInPortal` check to make sure we only redirect to a
page on the same Plone site. But a few more ways of tricking Plone
into accepting a malicious link were discovered, and fixed with this
hotfix.
