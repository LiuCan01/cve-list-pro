In Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.4 (inclusive) the
broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0
frames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause
the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. 
Older AMQP protocols are not affected.
