gnome-shell 3.22 through 3.24.1 mishandles extensions that fail to
reload, which can lead to leaving extensions enabled in the lock
screen. With these extensions, a bystander could launch applications
(but not interact with them), see information from the extensions
(e.g., what applications you have opened or what music you were
playing), or even execute arbitrary commands. It all depends on what
extensions a user has enabled. The problem is caused by lack of
exception handling in js/ui/extensionSystem.js.
