On Junos OS devices with SNMP enabled, a network based attacker with
unfiltered access to the RE can cause the Junos OS snmpd daemon to
crash and restart by sending a crafted SNMP packet. Repeated crashes
of the snmpd daemon can result in a partial denial of service
condition. Additionally, it may be possible to craft a malicious SNMP
packet in a way that can result in remote code execution. SNMP is
disabled in Junos OS by default. Junos OS devices with SNMP disabled
are not affected by this issue. No other Juniper Networks products or
platforms are affected by this issue.  NOTE: This is a different issue
than Cisco CVE-2017-6736, CVE-2017-6737, and CVE-2017-6738. Affected
