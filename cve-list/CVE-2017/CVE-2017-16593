This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files
on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager
7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit
this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be
bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.restore.del_005fdo_jsp servlet, which listens on
TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the filenames parameter, the
process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using
it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
delete any files accessible to the Administrator user. Was
ZDI-CAN-5104.
