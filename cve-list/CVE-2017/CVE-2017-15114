When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates)
to use the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority
as all non-libvirtd services. As no additional authentication is
configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is
equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another
service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate
privileges to gain control over compute nodes.
