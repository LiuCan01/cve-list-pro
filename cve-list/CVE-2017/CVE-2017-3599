Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL
(subcomponent: Server: Pluggable Auth). Supported versions that are
affected are 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily
"exploitable" vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS)
of MySQL Server. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.5 (Availability impacts). CVSS
Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). NOTE: the
previous information is from the April 2017 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on third-party claims that this issue is an integer overflow
in sql/auth/sql_authentication.cc which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via a crafted authentication packet.
