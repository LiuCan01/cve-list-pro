In Lenovo Connect2 versions earlier than 4.2.5.4885 for Windows and
4.2.5.3071 for Android, when an ad-hoc connection is made between two
systems for the purpose of sharing files, the password for this ad-hoc
connection will be stored in a user-readable location. An attacker
with read access to the user's contents could connect to the Connect2
hotspot and see the contents of files while they are being transferred
between the two systems.
