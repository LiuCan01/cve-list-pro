Exim supports the use of multiple "-p" command line arguments which
are malloc()'ed and never free()'ed, used in conjunction with other
issues allows attackers to cause arbitrary code execution. This
affects exim version 4.89 and earlier. Please note that at this time
upstream has released a patch (commit
65e061b76867a9ea7aeeb535341b790b90ae6c21), but it is not known if a
new point release is available that addresses this issue at this time.
