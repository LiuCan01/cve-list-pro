Artifex MuPDF 1.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted .xps file, related
to "Data from Faulting Address controls Branch Selection starting at
mupdf+0x000000000016aa61" on Windows. This occurs because
xps_load_links_in_glyphs in xps/xps-link.c does not verify that an xps
font could be loaded.
