A vulnerability in the H.264 decoder function of Cisco Meeting Server
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a Cisco
Meeting Server media process to restart unexpectedly when it receives
an illegal H.264 frame. The vulnerability is triggered by an H.264
frame that has an invalid picture parameter set (PPS) value. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed H.264
frame to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the media process
could restart. The media session should be re-established within a few
seconds, during which there could be a brief interruption in service.
