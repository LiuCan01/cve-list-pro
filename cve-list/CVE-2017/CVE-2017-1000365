The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and
environmental strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4
of the size), but does not take the argument and environment pointers
into account, which allows attackers to bypass this limitation. This
affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier. It appears that this
feature was introduced in the Linux Kernel version 2.6.23.
