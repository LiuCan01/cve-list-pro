Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x before 1.9.1 allows "go get" remote command
execution. Using custom domains, it is possible to arrange things so
that example.com/pkg1 points to a Subversion repository but
example.com/pkg1/pkg2 points to a Git repository. If the Subversion
repository includes a Git checkout in its pkg2 directory and some other
work is done to ensure the proper ordering of operations, "go get" can
be tricked into reusing this Git checkout for the fetch of code from
pkg2. If the Subversion repository's Git checkout has malicious
commands in .git/hooks/, they will execute on the system running "go
get."
