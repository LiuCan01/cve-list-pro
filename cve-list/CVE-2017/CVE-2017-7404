On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, if a victim logged in to the
Router's Web Interface visits a malicious site from another Browser
tab, the malicious site then can send requests to the victim's Router
without knowing the credentials (CSRF). An attacker can host a page
that sends a POST request to Form2File.htm that tries to upload
Firmware to victim's Router. This causes the router to reboot/crash
resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker may succeed in uploading
malicious Firmware.
