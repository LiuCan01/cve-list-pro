A vulnerability in the HTTP remote procedure call (RPC) service of
set-top box (STB) receivers manufactured by Cisco for Yes could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the
firmware of an affected device fails to handle certain XML values that
are passed to the HTTP RPC service listening on the local subnet of the
device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a
malformed request to an affected device. A successful attack could
cause the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Yes
has updated the affected devices with firmware that addresses this
vulnerability. Customers are not required to take action. Vulnerable
Products: This vulnerability affects YesMaxTotal, YesMax HD, and
YesQuattro STB devices. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd08812.
