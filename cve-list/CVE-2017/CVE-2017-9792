In Apache Impala (incubating) before 2.10.0, a malicious user with
"ALTER" permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table
data by altering the table properties to make it "external" and then
changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables.
This violates and works around the authorization requirement that
creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an "ALL" privilege
at the server scope. This privilege requirement for "CREATE" commands
is enforced to precisely avoid this scenario where a malicious user
can change the underlying Kudu table mapping. The fix is to enforce
the same privilege requirement for "ALTER" commands that would make
existing non-external Kudu tables external.
