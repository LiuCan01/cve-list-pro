In WordPress before 4.7.3, there is authenticated Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS) via Media File Metadata. This is demonstrated by both (1)
mishandling of the playlist shortcode in the wp_playlist_shortcode
function in wp-includes/media.php and (2) mishandling of meta
information in the renderTracks function in
wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-playlist.js.
