Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/56

An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack
out-of-bounds write in onigenc_unicode_get_case_fold_codes_by_str()
occurs during regular expression compilation. Code point 0xFFFFFFFF is
not properly handled in unicode_unfold_key(). A malformed regular
expression could result in 4 bytes being written off the end of a stack
buffer of expand_case_fold_string() during the call to
onigenc_unicode_get_case_fold_codes_by_str(), a typical stack buffer
overflow.
