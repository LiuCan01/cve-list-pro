VMware ESXi (6.0 before ESXi600-201711101-SG, 5.5
ESXi550-201709101-SG), Workstation (12.x before 12.5.8), and Fusion
(8.x before 8.5.9) contain a vulnerability that could allow an
authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set
of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in
remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC
session. Note: In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC
must be manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration
file. In addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic
through the built-in firewall.
