The swf_DefineLosslessBitsTagToImage function in lib/modules/swfbits.c
in SWFTools 0.9.2 mishandles an uncompress failure, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
application crash) because of extractDefinitions in lib/readers/swf.c
and fill_line_bitmap in lib/devices/render.c, as demonstrated by
swfrender.
