Routes used to stop running Metasploit tasks (either particular ones
or all tasks) allowed GET requests. Only POST requests should have
been allowed, as the stop/stop_all routes change the state of the
service. This could have allowed an attacker to stop currently-running
Metasploit tasks by getting an authenticated user to execute
JavaScript. As of Metasploit 4.14.0 (Update 2017061301), the routes
for stopping tasks only allow POST requests, which validate the
presence of a secret token to prevent CSRF attacks.
