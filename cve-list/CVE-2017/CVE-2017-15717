Reference: MLIST:[users] 20180110 CVE-2017-15717: Insufficient XSS protection for HREF attributes in Apache Sling XSS Protection API
Reference: URL:https://s.apache.org/CVE-2017-15717

A flaw in the way URLs are escaped and encoded in the
org.apache.sling.xss.impl.XSSAPIImpl#getValidHref and
org.apache.sling.xss.impl.XSSFilterImpl#isValidHref allows special
crafted URLs to pass as valid, although they carry XSS payloads. The
affected versions are Apache Sling XSS Protection API 1.0.4 to 1.0.18,
Apache Sling XSS Protection API Compat 1.1.0 and Apache Sling XSS
Protection API 2.0.0.
