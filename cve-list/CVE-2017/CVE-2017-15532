Prior to 10.6.4, Symantec Messaging Gateway may be susceptible to a
path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal). These types
of attacks aim to access files and directories that are stored outside

access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system
including application source code or configuration and critical system
files.
