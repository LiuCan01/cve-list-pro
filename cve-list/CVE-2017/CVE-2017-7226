The pe_ILF_object_p function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is
vulnerable to a heap-based buffer over-read of size 4049 because it
uses the strlen function instead of strnlen, leading to program crashes
in several utilities such as addr2line, size, and strings. It could
lead to information disclosure as well.
