Name: CVE-2017-8921
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8921
Phase: Assigned (20170512)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/flightgear/ci/faf872e7f71ca14c567ac7080561fc785d8d2fd0/

In FlightGear before 2017.2.1, the FGCommand interface allows
overwriting any file the user has write access to, but not with
arbitrary data: only with the contents of a FlightGear flightplan
(XML). A resource such as a malicious third-party aircraft could
exploit this to damage files belonging to the user. Both this issue and
CVE-2016-9956 are directory traversal vulnerabilities in
Autopilot/route_mgr.cxx - this one exists because of an incomplete fix
for CVE-2016-9956.
