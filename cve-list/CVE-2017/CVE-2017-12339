A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow
an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command
arguments to the CLI parser. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by injecting crafted command arguments into a vulnerable
CLI command. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
commands at the user's privilege level. On products that support
multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), this vulnerability could allow
the attacker to execute commands at the user's privilege level outside
the user's environment. This vulnerability affects the following
products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director
Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series
Switches, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches,
Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000
Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Fabric
Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode, Nexus 9000
Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, and Nexus 9500 R-Series Line
Cards and Fabric Modules. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve99925, CSCvf15164,
CSCvf15167, CSCvf15170, CSCvf15173.
