A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified
Communications Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the
web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to
click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow
the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvf79346.
