The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.29, does not validate the PLT section size, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
over-read and application crash) via a crafted ELF file, related to
elf_i386_get_synthetic_symtab in elf32-i386.c and
elf_x86_64_get_synthetic_symtab in elf64-x86-64.c.
