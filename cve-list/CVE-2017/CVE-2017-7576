DragonWave Horizon 1.01.03 wireless radios have hardcoded login
credentials (such as the username of energetic and password of
wireless) meant to allow the vendor to access the devices. These
credentials can be used in the web interface or by connecting to the
device via TELNET. This is fixed in recent versions including 1.4.8.
