Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/wiki/ARM-Trusted-Firmware-Security-Advisory-TFV-3

In ARM Trusted Firmware 1.3, RO memory is always executable at AArch64
Secure EL1, allowing attackers to bypass the MT_EXECUTE_NEVER
protection mechanism. This issue occurs because of inconsistency in the
number of execute-never bits (one bit versus two bits).
