The ZipCommon::isValidPath() function in Zip/src/ZipCommon.cpp in POCO
C++ Libraries before 1.8 does not properly restrict the filename value
in the ZIP header, which allows attackers to conduct absolute path
traversal attacks during the ZIP decompression, and possibly create or
overwrite arbitrary files, via a crafted ZIP file, related to a "file
path injection vulnerability".
