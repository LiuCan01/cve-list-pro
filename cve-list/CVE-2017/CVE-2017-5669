The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12
does not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding
operation, which allows local users to map page zero, and consequently
bypass a protection mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by
making crafted shmget and shmat system calls in a privileged context.
