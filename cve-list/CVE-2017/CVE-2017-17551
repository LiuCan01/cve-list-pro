The Backup and Restore feature in Mobotap Dolphin Browser for Android
12.0.2 suffers from an arbitrary file write vulnerability when
attempting to restore browser settings from a malicious Dolphin Browser
backup file. This arbitrary file write vulnerability allows an attacker
to overwrite a specific executable in the Dolphin Browser's data
directory with a crafted malicious executable. Every time the Dolphin
Browser is launched, it will attempt to run the malicious executable
from disk, thus executing the attacker's code.
