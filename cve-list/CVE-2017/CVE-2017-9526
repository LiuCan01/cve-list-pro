In Libgcrypt before 1.7.7, an attacker who learns the EdDSA session key
(from side-channel observation during the signing process) can easily
recover the long-term secret key. 1.7.7 makes a cipher/ecc-eddsa.c
change to store this session key in secure memory, to ensure that
constant-time point operations are used in the MPI library.
