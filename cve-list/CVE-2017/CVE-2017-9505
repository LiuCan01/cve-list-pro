Atlassian Confluence starting with 4.3.0 before 6.2.1 did not check if
a user had permission to view a page when creating a workbox
notification about new comments. An attacker who can login to
Confluence could receive workbox notifications, which contain the
content of comments, for comments added to a page after they started
watching it even if they do not have permission to view the page
itself.
