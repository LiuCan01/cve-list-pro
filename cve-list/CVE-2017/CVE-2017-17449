The __netlink_deliver_tap_skb function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in
the Linux kernel through 4.14.4, when CONFIG_NLMON is enabled, does not
restrict observations of Netlink messages to a single net namespace,
which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging
the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to sniff an nlmon interface for all
Netlink activity on the system.
