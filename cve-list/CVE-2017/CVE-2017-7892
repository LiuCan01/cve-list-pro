Status: Candidate

Phase: Assigned (20170417)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/blob/master/security-advisories/2017-04-17-0-apple-clang-elides-bounds-check.md

Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.5.3.1 allows remote crashes related to a
compiler optimization. A remote attacker can trigger a segfault in a
32-bit libcapnp application because Cap'n Proto relies on pointer
arithmetic calculations that overflow. An example compiler with
optimization that elides a bounds check in such calculations is Apple
LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.41). The attack vector is a crafted far
pointer within a message.
