Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in phpipam
1.2. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data passed to several pages (instructions in
app/admin/instructions/preview.php; subnetId in
app/admin/powerDNS/refresh-ptr-records.php). An attacker could execute
arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the
vulnerable website.
