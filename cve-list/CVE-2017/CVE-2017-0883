Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a permission
increase on re-sharing via OCS API issue. A permission related issue
within the OCS sharing API allowed an authenticated adversary to
reshare shared files with an increasing permission set. This may allow
an attacker to edit files in a share despite having only a 'read'
permission set. Note that this only affects folders and files that the
adversary has at least read-only permissions for.
