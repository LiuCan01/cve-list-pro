The web server on DBL DBLTek devices allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary OS commands by obtaining the admin password via a
frame.html?content=/dev/mtdblock/5 request, and then using this
password for the HTTP Basic Authentication needed for a
change_password.csp request, which supports a "<%%25call system.exec:"
string in the passwd parameter.
