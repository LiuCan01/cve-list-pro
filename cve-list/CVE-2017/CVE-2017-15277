ReadGIFImage in coders/gif.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 and GraphicsMagick
1.3.26 leaves the palette uninitialized when processing a GIF file that
has neither a global nor local palette. If the affected product is used
as a library loaded into a process that operates on interesting data,
this data sometimes can be leaked via the uninitialized palette.
