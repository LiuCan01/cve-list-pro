The getUserzoneCookie function in Kaltura before 13.2.0 uses a
hardcoded cookie secret to validate cookie signatures, which allows
remote attackers to bypass an intended protection mechanism and
consequently conduct PHP object injection attacks and execute
arbitrary PHP code via a crafted userzone cookie.
