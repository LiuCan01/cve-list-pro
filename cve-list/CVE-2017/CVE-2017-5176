A DLL Hijack issue was discovered in Rockwell Automation Connected
Components Workbench (CCW). The following versions are affected:
Connected Components Workbench - Developer Edition, v9.01.00 and
earlier: 9328-CCWDEVENE, 9328-CCWDEVZHE, 9328-CCWDEVFRE,
9328-CCWDEVITE, 9328-CCWDEVDEE, 9328-CCWDEVESE, and 9328-CCWDEVPTE; and
Connected Components Workbench - Free Standard Edition (All Supported
Languages), v9.01.00 and earlier. Certain DLLs included with versions
of CCW software can be potentially hijacked to allow an attacker to
gain rights to a victim's affected personal computer. Such access
rights can be at the same or potentially higher level of privileges as
the compromised user account, including and up to computer
administrator privileges.
