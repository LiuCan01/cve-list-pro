A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software 7.1 through
7.3 running on Cisco Nexus Series Switches could allow an
authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command
arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting
crafted command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. An exploit
could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files at the
user's privilege level outside of the user's path. Cisco Bug IDs:
