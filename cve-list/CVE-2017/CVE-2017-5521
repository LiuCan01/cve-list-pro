An issue was discovered on NETGEAR R8500, R8300, R7000, R6400, R7300,
R7100LG, R6300v2, WNDR3400v3, WNR3500Lv2, R6250, R6700, R6900, and
R8000 devices. They are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted
requests to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely
if the remote management option is set, and can also be exploited given
access to the router over LAN or WLAN. When trying to access the web
panel, a user is asked to authenticate; if the authentication is
canceled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is redirected
to a page that exposes a password recovery token. If a user supplies
the correct token to the page /passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and
password recovery is not enabled), they will receive the admin password
for the router. If password recovery is set the exploit will fail, as
it will ask the user for the recovery questions that were previously
set when enabling that feature. This is persistent (even after
disabling the recovery option, the exploit will fail) because the
router will ask for the security questions.
