In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value
placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not
initialized or reset before or between successive key=value
assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '='
assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory
used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially
confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in
denial of service.
