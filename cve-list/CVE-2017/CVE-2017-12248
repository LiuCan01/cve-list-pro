A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Unified Intelligence
Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web
interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the
web server of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link or by
intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the
request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the
attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve76835.
