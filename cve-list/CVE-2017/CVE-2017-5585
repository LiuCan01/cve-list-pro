OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content
Server) 7.3, when PostgreSQL Database is used and
return_top_results_row_based config option is false, does not properly
restrict DQL hints, which allows remote authenticated users to conduct
DQL injection attacks and execute arbitrary DML or DDL commands via a
crafted request.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2520.
