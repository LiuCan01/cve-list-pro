The D-Link DIR-615 device before v20.12PTb04 doesn't use SSL for any of
the authenticated pages. Also, it doesn't allow the user to generate
his own SSL Certificate. An attacker can simply monitor network traffic
to steal a user's credentials and/or credentials of users being added
while sniffing the traffic.
