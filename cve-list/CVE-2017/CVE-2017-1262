IBM Security Guardium 10.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting
attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using
specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response,
once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform
further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning, cross-site scripting,
and possibly obtain sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 124737.
