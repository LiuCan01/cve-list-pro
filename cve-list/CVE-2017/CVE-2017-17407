This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager
v7.2.699 build 1001. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the
content parameter provided to the script_test.jsp endpoint. A crafted
content request parameter can trigger execution of a system call
composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute code under the context of the web service.
