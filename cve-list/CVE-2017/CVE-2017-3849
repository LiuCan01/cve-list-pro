A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI)
registrar feature of Cisco IOS Software (possibly 15.2 through 15.6)
and Cisco IOS XE Software (possibly 3.7 through 3.18, and 16) could
allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input
validation on certain crafted packets. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted autonomic network channel discovery
packet to a device that has all the following characteristics: (1)
running a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release that
supports the ANI feature; (2) configured as an autonomic registrar; (3)
has a whitelist configured. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause the affected device to reload. Note: Autonomic networking should
be configured with a whitelist. Do not remove the whitelist as a
workaround. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc42717.
