An issue was discovered in chan_skinny.c in Asterisk Open Source
13.18.2 and older, 14.7.2 and older, and 15.1.2 and older, and
Certified Asterisk 13.13-cert7 and older. If the chan_skinny (aka SCCP
protocol) channel driver is flooded with certain requests, it can cause
the asterisk process to use excessive amounts of virtual memory,
eventually causing asterisk to stop processing requests of any kind.
