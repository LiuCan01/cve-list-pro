IBM has identified a vulnerability with IBM Spectrum Scale/GPFS
utilized on the Elastic Storage Server (ESS)/GPFS Storage Server (GSS)
during testing of an unsupported configuration, where users
applications are running on an active ESS I/O server node and utilize
direct I/O to perform a read or a write to a Spectrum Scale file. This
vulnerability may result in the use of an incorrect memory address,
leading to a Spectrum Scale/GPFS daemon failure with a Signal 11, and
possibly leading to denial of service or undetected data corruption.
