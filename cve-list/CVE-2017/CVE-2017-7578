Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/libming/libming/issues/68

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in parser.c in libming 0.4.7 allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (listswf application
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SWF
file. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2016-9831.
