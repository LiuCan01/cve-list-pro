A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UDP throttling
process of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM)
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
to insufficient rate limiting protection. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of SIP
messages. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to
reload unexpectedly. The device and services will restart
automatically. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Communications
Manager (CallManager) releases prior to the first fixed release; the
following list indicates the first minor release that includes the fix
for this vulnerability: 10.5.2.14900-16 11.0.1.23900-5 11.5.1.12900-2.
