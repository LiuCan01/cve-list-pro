ImageMagick before 7.0.5-2 and GraphicsMagick before 1.3.24 use
uninitialized memory in the RLE decoder, allowing an attacker to leak
sensitive information from process memory space, as demonstrated by
remote attacks against ImageMagick code in a long-running server
process that converts image data on behalf of multiple users. This is
caused by a missing initialization step in the ReadRLEImage function
in coders/rle.c.
