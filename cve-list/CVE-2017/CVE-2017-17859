Samsung Internet Browser 6.2.01.12 allows remote attackers to bypass
the Same Origin Policy, and conduct UXSS attacks to obtain sensitive
information, via vectors involving an IFRAME element inside XSLT data
in one part of an MHTML file. Specifically, JavaScript code in another
part of this MHTML file does not have a document.domain value
corresponding to the domain that is hosting the MHTML file, but instead
has a document.domain value corresponding to an arbitrary URL within
the content of the MHTML file.
