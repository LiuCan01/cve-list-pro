Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in SLiMS 7 Cendana
before 2017-03-16. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient
filtration of user-supplied data (id) passed to the
'slims7_cendana-master/template/default/detail_template.php' and
'slims7_cendana-master/template/default-rtl/detail_template.php' URLs.
An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser
in the context of the vulnerable website.
