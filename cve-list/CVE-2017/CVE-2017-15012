OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content
Server) through 7.3 does not properly validate the input of the
PUT_FILE RPC-command, which allows any authenticated user to hijack an
arbitrary file from the Content Server filesystem; because some files
on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this leads to
privilege escalation.
