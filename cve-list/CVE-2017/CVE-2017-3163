Reference: MLIST:[solr-user] 20170215 [SECURITY] CVE-2017-3163 Apache Solr ReplicationHandler path traversal attack
Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a6a33a186f293f9f9aecf3bd39c76252bfc49a79de4321dd2a53b488@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E

When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull
index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts
a file name. However, Solr before 5.5.4 and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not
validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special
request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the
Solr server process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by
firewall rules and/or authentication would not be at risk since only
trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access.
