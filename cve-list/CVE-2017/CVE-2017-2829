An exploitable directory traversal vulnerability exists in the web
management interface used by the Foscam C1 Indoor HD Camera running
application firmware 2.52.2.37. A specially crafted HTTP request can
cause the application to read a file from disk but a failure to
adequately filter characters results in allowing an attacker to
specify a file outside of a directory. An attacker can simply send an
HTTP request to the device to trigger this vulnerability.
