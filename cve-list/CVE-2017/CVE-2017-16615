An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality
in the parse_yaml_query method in parser.py in MLAlchemy before 0.2.2.
When processing YAML-Based queries for data, a YAML parser can execute
arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load
is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert
Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
