The DHCP relay subsystem of Cisco IOS 12.2 through 15.6 and Cisco IOS
XE Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain
full control of an affected system. The attacker could also cause an
affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
condition. The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow condition in
the DHCP relay subsystem of the affected software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4)
packet to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the
affected system or cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a
DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCsm45390, CSCuw77959.
