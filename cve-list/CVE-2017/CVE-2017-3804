A vulnerability in Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)

Switches software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to
cause a reload of the affected device. Switches in the FabricPath
domain crash because of an __inst_001__isis_fabricpath hap reset when
processing a crafted link-state packet. More Information: CSCvc45002.
