Microsoft Edge in Microsoft Windows 10 1703, 1709, Windows Server,
version 1709, and ChakraCore allows an attacker to bypass Control Flow
Guard (CFG) to run arbitrary code on a target system, due to how
Microsoft Edge handles accessing memory in code compiled by the Edge
Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, aka "Microsoft Edge Security Feature
Bypass Vulnerability". This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2017-11863 and
CVE-2017-11872.
