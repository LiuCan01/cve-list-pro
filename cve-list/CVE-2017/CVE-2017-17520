** DISPUTED ** tools/url_handler.pl in TIN 2.4.1 does not validate
strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER
environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has
reported that this is intentional behavior, because the documentation
states "url_handler.pl was designed to work together with tin which
only issues shell escaped absolute URLs."
