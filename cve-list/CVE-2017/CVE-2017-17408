This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Bitdefender Internet Security 2018.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within cevakrnl.xmd. The issue results from the
lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in
