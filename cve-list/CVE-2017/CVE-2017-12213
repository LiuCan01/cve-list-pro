A vulnerability in the dynamic access control list (ACL) feature of
Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches
could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause dynamic ACL
assignment to fail and the port to fail open. This could allow the
attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected port. The
vulnerability is due to an uncaught error condition that may occur
during the reassignment of the auth-default-ACL dynamic ACL to a switch
port after 802.1x authentication fails. A successful exploit of this
issue could allow a physically adjacent attacker to bypass 802.1x
authentication and cause the affected port to fail open, allowing the
attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected switch
port. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc72751.
