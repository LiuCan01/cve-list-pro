An issue was discovered in ABOOT in OnePlus 3 and 3T OxygenOS before
4.0.2. The attacker can reboot the device into the fastboot mode, which
could be done without any authentication. A physical attacker can press
the "Volume Up" button during device boot, where an attacker with ADB
access can issue the adb reboot bootloader command. Then, the attacker
can put the platform's SELinux in permissive mode, which severely
weakens it, by issuing: fastboot oem selinux permissive.
