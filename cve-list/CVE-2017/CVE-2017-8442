Elasticsearch X-Pack Security versions 5.0.0 to 5.4.3, when enabled,
can result in the Elasticsearch _nodes API leaking sensitive
configuration information, such as the paths and passphrases of SSL
keys that were configured as part of an authentication realm. This
could allow an authenticated Elasticsearch user to improperly view
these details.
