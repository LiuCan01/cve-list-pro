IBM WebSphere Application Server 7.0, 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 is vulnerable
to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit
this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to
return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the
attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning,
cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information. IBM
X-Force ID: 129578.
