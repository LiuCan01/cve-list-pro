This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the insert method of XFAScriptObject
objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An
attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the
context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5016.
