The bio_map_user_iov and bio_unmap_user functions in block/bio.c in the
Linux kernel before 4.13.8 do unbalanced refcounting when a SCSI I/O
vector has small consecutive buffers belonging to the same page. The
bio_add_pc_page function merges them into one, but the page reference
is never dropped. This causes a memory leak and possible system lockup
(exploitable against the host OS by a guest OS user, if a SCSI disk is
passed through to a virtual machine) due to an out-of-memory condition.
