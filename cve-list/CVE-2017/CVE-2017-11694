MEDHOST Document Management System contains hard-coded credentials that
are used for Apache Solr access. An attacker with knowledge of the
hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate directly with
Apache Solr may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and
financial information. The Apache Solr account name is dms. The
password is hard-coded throughout the application, and is the same
across all installations. Customers do not have the option to change
passwords. The dms account for Apache Solr has access to all indexed
patient documents.
