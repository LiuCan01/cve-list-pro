In the OMXNodeInstance::useBuffer and IOMX::freeBuffer functions,
there is a possible use after free due to a race condition if the user
frees the buffer while it's being used in another thread. This could
lead to a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a
privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed.
User interaction is needed for exploitation. Product: Android.
Versions: 8.1. Android ID: A-38118127.
