The application Piwigo is affected by an SQL injection vulnerability
in version 2.9.2 and possibly prior. This vulnerability allows remote
authenticated attackers to obtain information in the context of the
user used by the application to retrieve data from the database.
tags.php is affected: values of the edit_list parameters are not
sanitized; these are used to construct an SQL query and retrieve a
list of registered users into the application.
