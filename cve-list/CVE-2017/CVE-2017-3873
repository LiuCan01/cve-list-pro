A vulnerability in the Plug-and-Play (PnP) subsystem of the Cisco
Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points running a Lightweight
Access Point (AP) or Mobility Express image could allow an
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of PnP
server responses. The PnP feature is only active while the device does
not contain a configuration, such as a first time boot or after a
factory reset has been issued. An attacker with the ability to respond
to PnP configuration requests from the affected device can exploit the
vulnerability by returning malicious PnP responses. If a Cisco
Application Policy Infrastructure Controller - Enterprise Module
(APIC-EM) is available on the network, the attacker would need to
exploit the issue in the short window before a valid PnP response was
received. If successful, the attacker could gain the ability to execute
arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system
of the device. Cisco has confirmed that the only vulnerable software
version is 8.3.102.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb42386.
