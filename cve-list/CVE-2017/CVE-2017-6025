A Stack Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in 3S-Smart Software
Solutions GmbH CODESYS Web Server. The following versions of CODESYS
Web Server, part of the CODESYS WebVisu web browser visualization
software, are affected: CODESYS Web Server Versions 2.3 and prior. A
malicious user could overflow the stack buffer by providing overly long
strings to functions that handle the XML. Because the function does not
verify string size before copying to memory, the attacker may then be
able to crash the application or run arbitrary code.
