A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Aggregated
Services Routers running the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow
an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the CLI restrictions and
execute commands on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient input sanitization of user-supplied input at
the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a
script on the device that will allow them to bypass built-in
restrictions. An exploit could allow the unauthorized user to launch
the CLI directly from a command shell. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd47722.
Known Affected Releases: 21.0.v0.65839.
