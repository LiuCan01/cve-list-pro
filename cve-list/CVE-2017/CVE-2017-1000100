When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that
contains a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file
name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer
size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This too
large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to
send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto()
function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A
malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using
client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which
protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory
contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols
with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.
