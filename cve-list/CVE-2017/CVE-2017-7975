Artifex jbig2dec 0.13, as used in Ghostscript, allows out-of-bounds
writes because of an integer overflow in the jbig2_build_huffman_table
function in jbig2_huffman.c during operations on a crafted JBIG2 file,
leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execution of arbitrary code.
