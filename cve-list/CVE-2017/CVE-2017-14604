GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by
using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in
which a .desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec
field launches a malicious "sh -c" command. In other words, Nautilus
provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially
unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf
extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires
the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask
the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a
.desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the
metadata::trusted field.
