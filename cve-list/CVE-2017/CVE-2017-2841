An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the web
management interface used by the Foscam C1 Indoor HD Camera running
application firmware 2.52.2.37. A specially crafted HTTP request can
allow for a user to inject arbitrary data in the "msmtprc"
configuration file resulting in command execution. An attacker can
simply send an HTTP request to the device to trigger this
vulnerability.
