Reference: MISC:https://github.com/inversepath/tenshi/issues/6

Tenshi 0.15 creates a tenshi.pid file after dropping privileges to a
non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary
processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for tenshi.pid
modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat
/pathname/tenshi.pid`" command.
