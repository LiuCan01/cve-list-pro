curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical
range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of
transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range,
there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the
URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The
URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to
wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL
that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.
