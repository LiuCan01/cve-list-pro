In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there are multiple heap use after
free vulnerabilities in the tool nasm. The related heap is allocated in
the token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by
pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that could
cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted
double-linked list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in
delete_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high
possibility to lead to a remote code execution attack.
