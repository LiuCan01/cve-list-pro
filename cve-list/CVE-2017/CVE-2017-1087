In FreeBSD 10.x before 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p3, and
10.3-RELEASE-p24 named paths are globally scoped, meaning a process
located in one jail can read and modify the content of POSIX shared
memory objects created by a process in another jail or the host
system. As a result, a malicious user that has access to a jailed
system is able to abuse shared memory by injecting malicious content
in the shared memory region. This memory region might be executed by
applications trusting the shared memory, like Squid. This issue could
lead to a Denial of Service or local privilege escalation.
