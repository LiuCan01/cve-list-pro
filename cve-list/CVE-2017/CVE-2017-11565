debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was
designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the
apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a
wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same
forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor
restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection
mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian
stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit
file (instead of this tor.init script).
