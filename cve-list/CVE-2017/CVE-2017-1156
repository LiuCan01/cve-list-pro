IBM WebSphere Portal 8.5 and 9.0 could allow a remote attacker to
conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading
a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker
could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to
redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be
trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive
information or conduct further attacks against the victim. IBM
