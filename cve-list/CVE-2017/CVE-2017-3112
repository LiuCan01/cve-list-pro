An issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player 27.0.0.183 and earlier
versions. This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that
reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation
is part of AdobePSDK metadata. The use of an invalid (out-of-range)
pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes
the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data
exposure.
