Reference: CONFIRM:https://opencast.jira.com/browse/MH-11862

In Opencast 2.2.3 and older if user names overlap, the Opencast search
service used for publication to the media modules and players will
handle the access control incorrectly so that users only need to match
part of the user name used for the access restriction. For example, a
user with the role ROLE_USER will have access to recordings published
only for ROLE_USER_X.
