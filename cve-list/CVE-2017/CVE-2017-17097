gps-server.net GPS Tracking Software (self hosted) 2.x has a password
reset procedure that immediately resets passwords upon an
unauthenticated request, and then sends e-mail with a predictable
(date-based) password to the admin, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain access by predicting this new password. This is
related to the use of gmdate for password creation in fn_connect.php.
