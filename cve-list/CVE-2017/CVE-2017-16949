An issue was discovered in the AccessKeys AccessPress Anonymous Post
Pro plugin through 3.1.9 for WordPress. Improper input sanitization
allows the attacker to override the settings for allowed file
extensions and upload file size, related to
inc/cores/file-uploader.php and file-uploader/file-uploader-class.php.
This allows the attacker to upload anything they want to the server,
as demonstrated by an
action=ap_file_upload_action&allowedExtensions[]=php request to
/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php that results in a .php file upload and
resultant PHP code execution.
