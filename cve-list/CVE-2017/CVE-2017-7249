Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in Gazelle before
2017-03-19. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data (action, userid) passed to the
'Gazelle-master/sections/tools/data/ocelot_info.php' URL. An attacker
could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the
context of the vulnerable website.
