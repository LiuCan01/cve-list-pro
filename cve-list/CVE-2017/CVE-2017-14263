Reference: MISC:https://github.com/zzz66686/Honeywell_NVR_vul

Honeywell NVR devices allow remote attackers to create a user account
in the admin group by leveraging access to a guest account to obtain a
session ID, and then sending that session ID in a userManager.addUser
request to the /RPC2 URI. The attacker can login to the device with
that new user account to fully control the device.
