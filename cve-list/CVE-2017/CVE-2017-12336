A vulnerability in the TCL scripting subsystem of Cisco NX-OS System
Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the
interactive TCL shell and gain unauthorized access to the underlying
operating system of the device. The vulnerability exists due to
insufficient input validation of user-supplied files passed to the
interactive TCL shell of the affected device. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability to escape the scripting sandbox and execute
arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the
privileges of the authenticated user. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must have local access and be authenticated to the targeted
device with administrative or tclsh execution privileges. This
vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System
Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric
Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches,
