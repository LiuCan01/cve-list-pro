An Insufficiently Protected Credentials issue was discovered in
Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs Modicon M241, all firmware versions,
and Modicon M251, all firmware versions. Log-in credentials are sent
over the network with Base64 encoding leaving them susceptible to
sniffing. Sniffed credentials could then be used to log into the web
application.
