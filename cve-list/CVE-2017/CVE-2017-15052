TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access
control when requesting users.queries.php. It is then possible for a
manager user to delete an arbitrary user (including admin), or modify
attributes of any arbitrary user except administrator. To exploit the
vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must have the manager rights
on the application, then tamper with the requests sent directly, for
example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_user" on
users.queries.php.
