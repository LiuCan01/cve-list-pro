ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP 7.0.x through 7.0.22 and 7.1.x
through 7.1.8 is prone to a heap use after free while unserializing
untrusted data, related to improper use of the hash API for key
deletion in a situation with an invalid array size. Exploitation of
this issue can have an unspecified impact on the integrity of PHP.
