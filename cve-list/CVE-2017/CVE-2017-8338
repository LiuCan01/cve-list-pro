A vulnerability in MikroTik Version 6.38.5 could allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust all available CPU via a
flood of UDP packets on port 500 (used for L2TP over IPsec), preventing
the affected router from accepting new connections; all devices will be
disconnected from the router and all logs removed automatically.
