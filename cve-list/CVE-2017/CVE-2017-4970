An issue was discovered in Cloud Foundry Foundation cf-release v255 and
Staticfile buildpack versions v1.4.0 - v1.4.3. A regression introduced
in the Static file build pack causes the Staticfile.auth configuration
to be ignored when the Static file file is not present in the
application root. Applications containing a Staticfile.auth file but
not a Static file had their basic auth turned off when an operator
upgraded the Static file build pack in the foundation to one of the
vulnerable versions. Note that Static file applications without a
Static file are technically misconfigured, and will not successfully
detect unless the Static file build pack is explicitly specified.
