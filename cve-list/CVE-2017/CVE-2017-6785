A vulnerability in configuration modification permissions validation
for Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to perform a horizontal privilege escalation where one
user can modify another user's configuration. The vulnerability is due
to lack of proper Role Based Access Control (RBAC) when certain user
configuration changes are requested. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending an authenticated, crafted HTTP request to the
targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact
the integrity of the application where one user can modify the
configuration of another user's information. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve27331. Known Affected Releases: 10.5(2.10000.5),
11.0(1.10000.10), 11.5(1.10000.6).
