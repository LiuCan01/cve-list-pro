An issue was discovered in Enalean Tuleap 9.6 and prior versions. The
vulnerability exists because the User::getRecentElements() method is
using the unserialize() function with a preference value that can be
arbitrarily manipulated by malicious users through the REST API
interface, and this can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects
into the application scope, allowing an attacker to perform a variety
of attacks (including but not limited to Remote Code Execution).
