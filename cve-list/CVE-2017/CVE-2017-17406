This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Netgain Enterprise Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The
specific flaw exists within an exposed RMI registry, which listens on
TCP ports 1800 and 1850 by default. The issue results from the lack of
proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in
deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
current process. Was ZDI-CAN-4753.
