The Spiceworks TFTP Server, as distributed with Spiceworks Inventory
7.5, allows remote attackers to access the Spiceworks
dataconfigurations directory by leveraging the unauthenticated nature
of the TFTP service for all clients who can reach UDP port 69, as
demonstrated by a WRQ (aka Write request) operation for a configuration
file or an executable file.
