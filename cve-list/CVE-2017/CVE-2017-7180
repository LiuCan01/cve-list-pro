Net Monitor for Employees Pro through 5.3.4 has an unquoted service
path, which allows a Security Feature Bypass of its documented "Block
applications" design goal. The local attacker must have privileges to
write to program.exe in a protected directory, such as the
%SYSTEMDRIVE% directory, and thus the issue is not interpreted as a
direct privilege escalation. However, the local attacker might have the
goal of executing program.exe even though program.exe is a blocked
application.
