A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center web interface
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity
of the system by executing a Document Object Model (DOM)-based,
environment or client-side cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The
vulnerability occurs because user-supplied data in the DOM input is not
validated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
crafted URLs that contain malicious DOM statements to the affected
system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to affect the
integrity of the system by manipulating the database. Known Affected
Releases 11.0(1)ES10. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf18325.
