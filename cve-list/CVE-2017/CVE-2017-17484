The ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8 function in ucnv_u8.cpp in International
Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 60.1 mishandles
ucnv_convertEx calls for UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and
application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted string, as demonstrated by ZNC.
