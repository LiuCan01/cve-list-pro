A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS System Software running on Cisco MDS
Multilayer Director Switches, Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, and
Cisco Nexus 7700 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to access the Bash shell of an affected device's operating
system, even if the Bash shell is disabled on the system. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied
parameters that are passed to certain functions of the Python scripting
sandbox of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to escape the scripting sandbox and enter the Bash shell
of the operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user
for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
must have local access to the affected system and be authenticated to
the affected system with administrative or Python execution privileges.
