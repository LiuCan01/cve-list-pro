The AT&T U-verse 9.2.2h0d83 firmware for the Arris NVG589 and NVG599
devices, when IP Passthrough mode is not used, configures an
unauthenticated proxy service on WAN TCP port 49152, which allows
remote attackers to establish arbitrary TCP connections to intranet
hosts by sending x2axcex01 followed by other predictable values.
