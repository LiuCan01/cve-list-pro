An issue was discovered in AppArmor before 2.12. Incorrect handling of
unknown AppArmor profiles in AppArmor init scripts, upstart jobs,
and/or systemd unit files allows an attacker to possibly have increased
attack surfaces of processes that were intended to be confined by
AppArmor. This is due to the common logic to handle 'restart'
operations removing AppArmor profiles that aren't found in the typical
filesystem locations, such as /etc/apparmor.d/. Userspace projects that
manage their own AppArmor profiles in atypical directories, such as
what's done by LXD and Docker, are affected by this flaw in the
AppArmor init script logic.
