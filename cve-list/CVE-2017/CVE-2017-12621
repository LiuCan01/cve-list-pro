During Jelly (xml) file parsing with Apache Xerces, if a custom
doctype entity is declared with a "SYSTEM" entity with a URL and that
entity is used in the body of the Jelly file, during parser
instantiation the parser will attempt to connect to said URL. This
could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in Apache Commons
Jelly before 1.0.1.
