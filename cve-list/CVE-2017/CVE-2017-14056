In libavformat/rl2.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in rl2_read_header() due to
lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory
consumption. When a crafted RL2 file, which claims a large
"frame_count" field in the header but does not contain sufficient
backing data, is provided, the loops (for offset and size tables) would
consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check
inside these loops.
