In libavformat/nsvdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in
nsv_parse_NSVf_header() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might
cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted NSV file, which claims a
large "table_entries_used" field in the header but does not contain
sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop over
'table_entries_used' would consume huge CPU resources, since there is
no EOF check inside the loop.
