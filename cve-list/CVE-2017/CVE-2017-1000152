Mahara 15.04 before 15.04.7 and 15.10 before 15.10.3 running PHP 5.3
are vulnerable to one user being logged in as another user on a
separate computer as the same session ID is served. This situation can
occur when a user takes an action that forces another user to be
logged out of Mahara, such as an admin changing another user's account
settings.
