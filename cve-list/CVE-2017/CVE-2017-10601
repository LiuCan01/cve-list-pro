A specific device configuration can result in a commit failure
condition. When this occurs, a user is logged in without being
prompted for a password while trying to login through console, ssh,
ftp, telnet or su, etc., This issue relies upon a device configuration
precondition to occur. Typically, device configurations are the result
of a trusted administrative change to the system's running
configuration. The following error messages may be seen when this
failure occurs: mgd: error: commit failed: (statements constraint
check failed) Warning: Commit failed, activating partial
configuration. Warning: Edit the router configuration to fix these
errors. If the administrative changes are not made that result in such
a failure, then this issue is not seen. No other Juniper Networks
