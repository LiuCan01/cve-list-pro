A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue was discovered in Westermo
MRD-305-DIN versions older than 1.7.5.0, and MRD-315, MRD-355, MRD-455
versions older than 1.7.5.0. The application does not verify whether a
request was intentionally provided by the user, making it possible for
an attacker to trick a user into making a malicious request to the
server.
