The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.14.6 omitted an
access-control check when adding a key to the current task's "default
request-key keyring" via the request_key() system call, allowing a
local user to use a sequence of crafted system calls to add keys to a
keyring with only Search permission (not Write permission) to that
keyring, related to construct_get_dest_keyring() in
security/keys/request_key.c.
