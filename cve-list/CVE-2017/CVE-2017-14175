In coders/xbm.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 Q16, a DoS in ReadXBMImage() due
to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption.
When a crafted XBM file, which claims large rows and columns fields in
the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided,
the loop over the rows would consume huge CPU resources, since there is
no EOF check inside the loop.
