IBM Business Process Manager 8.0 and 8.5 could allow a remote attacker
to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By
persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote
attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed
to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be
trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive
information or conduct further attacks against the victim. IBM X-Force
ID: 122891.
