dmcrypt-get-device, as shipped in the eject package of Debian and
Ubuntu, does not check the return value of the (1) setuid or (2) setgid
function, which might cause dmcrypt-get-device to execute code, which
was intended to run as an unprivileged user, as root. This affects
eject through 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1 on Debian, eject before
2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1ubuntu0.16.10.1 on Ubuntu 16.10, eject
before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1ubuntu0.16.04.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
eject before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1ubuntu0.14.04.1 on Ubuntu 14.04
LTS, and eject before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-9ubuntu0.1 on Ubuntu 12.04
LTS.
