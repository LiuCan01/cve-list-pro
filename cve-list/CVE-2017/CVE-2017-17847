An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. Signature spoofing is
possible because the UI does not properly distinguish between an
attachment signature, and a signature that applies to the entire
containing message, aka TBE-01-021. This is demonstrated by an e-mail
message with an attachment that is a signed e-mail message in
message/rfc822 format.
