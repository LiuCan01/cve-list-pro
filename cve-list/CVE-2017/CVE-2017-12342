A vulnerability in the Open Agent Container (OAC) feature of Cisco
Nexus Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to
read and send packets outside the scope of the OAC. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient internal security measures in the OAC feature.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific
packets for communication on the device-internal network. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to run code on the underlying host
operating system. OAC is not enabled by default. For a device to be
vulnerable, an administrator would need to install and activate this
feature. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Nexus Series
Switches: Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 5000 Series
Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches,
Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700
Series Switches. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve53542, CSCvf36621.
