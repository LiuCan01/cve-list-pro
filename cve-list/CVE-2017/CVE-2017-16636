In Bludit v1.5.2 and v2.0.1, an XSS vulnerability is located in the new
page, new category, and edit post function body message context. Remote
attackers are able to bypass the basic editor validation to trigger
cross site scripting. The XSS is persistent and the request method to
inject via editor is GET. To save the editor context, the followup POST
method request must be processed to perform the attack via the
application side. The basic validation of the editor does not allow
injecting script codes and blocks the context. Attackers can inject the
code by using an editor tag that is not recognized by the basic
validation. Thus allows a restricted user account to inject malicious
script code to perform a persistent attack against higher privilege
web-application user accounts.
