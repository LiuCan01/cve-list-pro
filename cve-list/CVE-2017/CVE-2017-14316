A parameter verification issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. The
function `alloc_heap_pages` allows callers to specify the first NUMA
node that should be used for allocations through the `memflags`
parameter; the node is extracted using the `MEMF_get_node` macro. While
the function checks to see if the special constant `NUMA_NO_NODE` is
specified, it otherwise does not handle the case where `node >=
MAX_NUMNODES`. This allows an out-of-bounds access to an internal
array.
