vBulletin through 5.3.x on Windows allows remote PHP code execution
because a require_once call is reachable with an unauthenticated
request that can include directory traversal sequences to specify an
arbitrary pathname, and because ../ traversal is blocked but ..traversal is not blocked. For example, an attacker can make an invalid
HTTP request containing PHP code, and then make an
index.php?routestring= request with enough instances of ".." to reach
an Apache HTTP Server log file.
