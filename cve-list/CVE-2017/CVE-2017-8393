The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a global buffer over-read error
because of an assumption made by code that runs for objcopy and strip,
that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections are always named starting with a
.rel/.rela prefix. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an
analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy
and strip, to crash.
