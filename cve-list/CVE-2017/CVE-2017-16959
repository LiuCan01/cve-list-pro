The locale feature in cgi-bin/luci on TP-Link TL-WVR, TL-WAR, TL-ER,
and TL-R devices allows remote authenticated users to test for the
existence of arbitrary files by making an operation=write;locale=%0d
request, and then making an operation=read request with a crafted
Accept-Language HTTP header, related to the set_sysinfo and get_sysinfo
functions in /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/locale.lua in uhttpd.
