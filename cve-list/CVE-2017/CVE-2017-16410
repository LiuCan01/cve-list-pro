An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The
vulnerability is a result of untrusted input that is used to calculate
an array index; the calculation occurs in the image conversion module,
when processing GIF files. The vulnerability leads to an operation that
can write to a memory location that is outside of the memory addresses
allocated for the data structure. The specific scenario leads to a
write access to a memory location that does not belong to the relevant
process address space.
