In PHP before 5.6.32, 7.x before 7.0.25, and 7.1.x before 7.1.11, an
error in the date extension's timelib_meridian handling of 'front of'
and 'back of' directives could be used by attackers able to supply date
strings to leak information from the interpreter, related to
ext/date/lib/parse_date.c out-of-bounds reads affecting the
php_parse_date function. NOTE: this is a different issue than
CVE-2017-11145.
