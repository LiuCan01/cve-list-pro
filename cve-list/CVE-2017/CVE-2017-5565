Code injection vulnerability in Trend Micro Maximum Security 11.0 (and
earlier), Internet Security 11.0 (and earlier), and Antivirus+ Security
11.0 (and earlier) allows a local attacker to bypass a self-protection
mechanism, inject arbitrary code, and take full control of any Trend
Micro process via a "DoubleAgent" attack. One perspective on this issue
is that (1) these products do not use the Protected Processes feature,
and therefore an attacker can enter an arbitrary Application Verifier
Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the registry; (2)
the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes
(regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options
for these products; and (3) this mechanism can be bypassed by an
attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during
the attack.
