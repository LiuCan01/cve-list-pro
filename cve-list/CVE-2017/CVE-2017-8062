drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dw2102.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and
4.10.x before 4.10.4 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system
crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
