A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration
Provisioning Software (prior to Release 12.1) could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to delete any file from an affected
system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not
perform proper input validation of HTTP requests and fails to apply
role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that
uses directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file
location on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to delete any file from the system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc99597.
