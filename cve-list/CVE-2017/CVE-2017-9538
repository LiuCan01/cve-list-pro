The 'Upload logo from external path' function of SolarWinds Network
Performance Monitor version 12.0.15300.90 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (permanent display of a "Cannot exit above
the top directory" error message throughout the entire web
application) via a ".." in the path field. In other words, the denial
of service is caused by an incorrect implementation of a
directory-traversal protection mechanism.
