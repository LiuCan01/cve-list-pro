An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i
products, aka BlueSteal. An attacker can remotely unlock any safe in
this product line without a valid PIN code. Even though the phone
application requires it and there is a field to supply the PIN code in
an authorization request, the safe does not check the PIN code, so an
attacker can obtain authorization using any value. Once an attacker
sees the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement for the safe, they
need only to write a BLE characteristic to enable notifications, and
send a crafted getAuthor packet that returns a temporary key, and an
unlock packet including that temporary key. The safe then opens after
the unlock packet is processed, with no verification of PIN or other
credentials.
