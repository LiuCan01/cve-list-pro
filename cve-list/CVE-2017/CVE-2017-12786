Network interfaces of the cliengine and noviengine services, included
in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on
NoviSwitch devices, can be inadvertently exposed if an operator
attempts to modify ACLs, because of a bug when ACL modifications are
applied. This could be leveraged by remote, unauthenticated attackers
to gain resultant privileged (root) code execution on the switch,
because there is a stack-based buffer overflow during unserialization
of packet data.
