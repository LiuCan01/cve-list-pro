In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to
crash the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data
fields for client name or realm. The parser would unconditionally
dereference NULL pointers in that case, leading to a segmentation
fault. This is related to the _kdc_as_rep function in kdc/kerberos5.c
and the der_length_visible_string function in lib/asn1/der_length.c.
