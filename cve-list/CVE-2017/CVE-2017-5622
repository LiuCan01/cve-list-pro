With OxygenOS before 4.0.3, when a charger is connected to a
powered-off OnePlus 3 or 3T device, the platform starts with adbd
enabled. Therefore, a malicious charger or a physical attacker can open
up, without authorization, an ADB session with the device, in order to
further exploit other vulnerabilities and/or exfiltrate sensitive
information.
