A vulnerability in the Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) code of Cisco
IOS 15.0 through 15.4 for Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches could
allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a C6800-16P10G or
C6800-16P10G-XL type line card to crash, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a memory
management issue in the affected software. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by creating a large number of VPLS-generated MAC
entries in the MAC address table of an affected device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to cause a C6800-16P10G or
C6800-16P10G-XL type line card to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.
This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches that are
running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and have a Cisco
C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL line card in use with Supervisor Engine
6T. To be vulnerable, the device must also be configured with VPLS and
the C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL line card needs to be the
core-facing MPLS interfaces. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva61927.
