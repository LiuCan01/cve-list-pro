An issue has been found in the DNSSEC validation component of PowerDNS
Recursor from 4.0.0 and up to and including 4.0.6, where the
signatures might have been accepted as valid even if the signed data
was not in bailiwick of the DNSKEY used to sign it. This allows an
attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of
records by issuing a valid signature for the crafted records.
