A vulnerability in the DHCP code for the Zero Touch Provisioning
feature of Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device
to reload. The vulnerability is due to a format string vulnerability
when processing a crafted DHCP packet for Zero Touch Provisioning. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially
crafted DHCP packet to an affected device. An exploit could allow the
attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 920
Series Aggregation Services Routers that are running an affected
release of Cisco IOS XE Software (3.13 through 3.18) and are listening
on the DHCP server port. By default, the devices do not listen on the
DHCP server port. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy56385.
