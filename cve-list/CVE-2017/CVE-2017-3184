ACTi cameras including the D, B, I, and E series using firmware
version A1D-500-V6.11.31-AC fail to properly restrict access to the
factory reset page. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability by directly accessing the
http://x.x.x.x/setup/setup_maintain_firmware-default.html page. This
will allow an attacker to perform a factory reset on the device,
leading to a denial of service condition or the ability to make use of
default credentials (CVE-2017-3186).
