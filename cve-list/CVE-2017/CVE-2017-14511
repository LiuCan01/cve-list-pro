An issue was discovered in SAP E-Recruiting (aka ERECRUIT) 605 through
617. When an external applicant registers to the E-Recruiting
application, he/she receives a link by email to confirm access to the
provided email address. However, this measure can be bypassed and
attackers can register and confirm email addresses that they do not
have access to (candidate_hrobject is predictable and corr_act_guid is
improperly validated). Furthermore, since an email address can be
registered only once, an attacker could prevent other legitimate users
from registering. This is SAP Security Note 2507798.
