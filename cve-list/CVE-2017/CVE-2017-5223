An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML
method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as
an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert
relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base
directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning
that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and
added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML
method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML
document, and must not set a base directory.
