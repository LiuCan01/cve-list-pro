Ruby through 2.2.7, 2.3.x through 2.3.4, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 can
expose arbitrary memory during a JSON.generate call. The issues lies in
using strdup in ext/json/ext/generator/generator.c, which will stop
after encountering a '0' byte, returning a pointer to a string of
length zero, which is not the length stored in space_len.
