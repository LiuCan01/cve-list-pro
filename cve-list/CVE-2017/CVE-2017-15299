The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.13.7 mishandles use of
add_key for a key that already exists but is uninstantiated, which
allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted system call.
