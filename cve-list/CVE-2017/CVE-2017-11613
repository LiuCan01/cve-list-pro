In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the
TIFFOpen function. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service
attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The
value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In
the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc
function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of
td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the
system or trigger the OOM killer.
