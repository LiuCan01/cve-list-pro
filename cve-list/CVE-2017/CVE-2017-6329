Symantec VIP Access for Desktop prior to 2.2.4 can be susceptible to a
DLL Pre-Loading vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an
application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides
a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is
configured, the application will generally follow a specific search
path to locate the DLL. The exploitation of the vulnerability
manifests as a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which
results in a foreign executable running under the context of the
application.
