A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack against a user of the affected system. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are
passed to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious
link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code
into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web
interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf51241, CSCvf51261.
