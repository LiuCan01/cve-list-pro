An information-leakage issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios
before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. There is a page
in the web interface that will show you the device's serial number,
regardless of whether or not you have logged in. This
information-leakage issue is relevant because there is another page
(accessible without any authentication) that allows you to remotely
factory reset the device simply by entering the serial number.
