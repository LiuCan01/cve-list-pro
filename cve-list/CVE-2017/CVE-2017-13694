The acpi_ps_complete_final_op() function in
drivers/acpi/acpica/psobject.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does
not flush the node and node_ext caches and causes a kernel stack dump,
which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through
4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.
