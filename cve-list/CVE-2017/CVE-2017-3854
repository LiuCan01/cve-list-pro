A vulnerability in the mesh code of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate
a WLC in a meshed topology. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
authentication of the parent access point in a mesh configuration. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forcing the target system
to disconnect from the correct parent access point and reconnect to a
rogue access point owned by the attacker. An exploit could allow the
attacker to control the traffic flowing through the impacted access
point or take full control of the target system. This vulnerability
affects the following products running a vulnerable version of Wireless
LAN Controller software and configured for meshed mode: Cisco 8500
Series Wireless Controller, Cisco 5500 Series Wireless Controller,
Cisco 2500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco Flex 7500 Series Wireless
Controller, Cisco Virtual Wireless Controller, Wireless Services Module
2 (WiSM2). Note that additional configuration is needed in addition to
upgrading to a fixed release. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuc98992 CSCuu14804.
