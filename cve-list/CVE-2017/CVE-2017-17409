This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Bitdefender Internet Security 2018.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within emulator 0x10A in cevakrnl.xmd. The issue
results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
which can result in an integer overflow before writing to memory. An
attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the
context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-5102.
