A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco
Firepower Management Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected
device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an
affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access
sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc50771.
