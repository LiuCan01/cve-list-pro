BouncyCastle TLS prior to version 1.0.3, when configured to use the
JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions,
provides a weak Bleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using
RSA key exchange is negotiated. An attacker can recover the private
key from a vulnerable application. This vulnerability is referred to
as "ROBOT."
