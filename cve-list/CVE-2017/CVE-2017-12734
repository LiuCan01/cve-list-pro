A vulnerability has been identified in Siemens LOGO! devices before
V1.81.2. An attacker with network access to the integrated web server
on port 80/tcp could obtain the session ID of an active user session. A
user must be logged in to the web interface. Siemens recommends to use
the integrated webserver on port 80/tcp only in trusted networks.
