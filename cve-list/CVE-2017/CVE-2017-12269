A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Spark Messaging Software could
allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation by the web UI of the affected software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by injecting XSS content into the web UI of
the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
force a user to execute code of the attacker's choosing or allow the
attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the user. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvf70587, CSCvf70592.
