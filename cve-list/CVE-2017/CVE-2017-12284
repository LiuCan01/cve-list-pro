A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Jabber for Windows Client
could allow an authenticated, local attacker to retrieve user profile
information, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential
information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input- and
validation-checking mechanisms in the system. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by issuing specific commands after authenticating to
the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view
profile information where only certain parameters should be visible.
