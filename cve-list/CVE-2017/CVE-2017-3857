A vulnerability in the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) parsing
function of Cisco IOS (12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.6) and
Cisco IOS XE (3.1 through 3.18) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is
due to insufficient validation of L2TP packets. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted L2TP packet to an
affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a
vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software if the L2TP
feature is enabled for the device and the device is configured as an
L2TP Version 2 (L2TPv2) or L2TP Version 3 (L2TPv3) endpoint. By
default, the L2TP feature is not enabled. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy82078.
