A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Remote Expert Manager
Software 11.0.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
access sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability
exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect
sensitive data when responding to HTTP requests that are sent to the
web interface of the software. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web interface of
the software on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to access sensitive information about the software. The
attacker could use this information to conduct additional
reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc52860.
