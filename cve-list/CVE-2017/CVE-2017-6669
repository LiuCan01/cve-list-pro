Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx
Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files. An
attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a
malicious ARF file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch
the file. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected
player to crash and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code
execution on the system of a targeted user. The Cisco WebEx Network
Recording Player is an application that is used to play back WebEx
meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an online
meeting attendee. The player can be automatically installed when the
user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server. The
following client builds are affected by this vulnerability: Cisco WebEx
Business Suite (WBS29) client builds prior to T29.13.130, Cisco WebEx
Business Suite (WBS30) client builds prior to T30.17, Cisco WebEx
Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.10. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc47758 CSCvc51227 CSCvc51242.
