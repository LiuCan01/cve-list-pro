An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. For
authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512
without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure
secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the
hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table
attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.
