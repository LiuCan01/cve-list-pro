The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid write of size 8
because of missing a malloc() return-value check to see if memory had
actually been allocated in the _bfd_generic_get_section_contents
function. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis
of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy, to crash.
