A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow
an authenticated, local attacker to read the contents of arbitrary
files. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for a

issuing a crafted command on the CLI. An exploit could allow the
attacker unauthorized access to read arbitrary files on the underlying
local file system. On products that support multiple virtual device
contexts (VDCs), this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read
files from any VDC. This vulnerability affects the following products
