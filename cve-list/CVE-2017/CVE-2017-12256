A vulnerability in the Akamai Connect feature of Cisco Wide Area
Application Services (WAAS) Appliances could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to certain file-handling
inefficiencies of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by directing client systems to access a corrupted file
that the client systems cannot decompress correctly. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash
or hang unexpectedly and result in a DoS condition that may require
manual intervention to regain normal operating conditions. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCve82472.
