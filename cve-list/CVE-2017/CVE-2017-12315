A vulnerability in system logging when replication is being configured
with the Cisco HyperFlex System could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to view sensitive information that should be restricted in the
system log files. The attacker would have to be authenticated as an
administrative user to conduct this attack. The vulnerability is due to
lack of proper masking of sensitive information in system log files. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
targeted device and viewing the system log file. An exploit could allow
the attacker to view sensitive system information that should have been
restricted. The attacker could use this information to conduct
additional reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg31472.
