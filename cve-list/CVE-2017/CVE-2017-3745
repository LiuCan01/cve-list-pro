In Lenovo XClarity Administrator (LXCA) before 1.3.0, if service data
is downloaded from LXCA, a non-administrative user may have access to
password information for users that have previously authenticated to
the LXCA's internal LDAP server, including administrative accounts and
service accounts with administrative privileges. This is an issue only
for users who have used local authentication with LXCA and not remote
authentication against external LDAP or ADFS servers.
