Reference: MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145770/Yawcam-0.6.0-Directory-Traversal.html
Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.yawcam.com/news.php

Directory traversal in the HTTP server on Yawcam 0.2.6 through 0.6.0
devices allows attackers to read arbitrary files through a sequence of
the form '.x./' or '....x/' where x is a pattern composed of one or
more (zero or more for the second pattern) of either  or .. -- for
example a '../', '..../' or '..../' sequence. For files with no
extension, a single dot needs to be appended to ensure the HTTP server
does not alter the request, e.g., a "GET
/../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts."
request.
