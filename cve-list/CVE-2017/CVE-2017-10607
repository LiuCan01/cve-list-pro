Name: CVE-2017-10607
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10607
Phase: Assigned (20170628)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10810

Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1R1, and services releases based off of
16.1R1, are vulnerable to the receipt of a crafted BGP Protocol Data
Unit (PDU) sent directly to the router, which can cause the RPD
routing process to crash and restart. Unlike BGP UPDATEs, which are
transitive in nature, this issue can only be triggered by a packet
sent directly to the IP address of the router. Repeated crashes of the
rpd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. This
issue only affects devices running Junos OS 16.1R1 and services
releases based off of 16.1R1 (e.g. 16.1R1-S1, 16.1R1-S2, 16.1R1-S3).
No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this vulnerability, and
this issue was resolved in Junos OS 16.2 prior to 16.2R1. No other
Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
This issue was found during internal product security testing.
