flower.initd in the Gentoo dev-python/flower package before 0.9.1-r1
for Celery Flower sets PID file ownership to a non-root account, which
might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging
access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root
script executes a "kill `cat /pathname`" command.
