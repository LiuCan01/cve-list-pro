An issue was discovered in dotCMS through 3.6.1. The
findChildrenByFilter() function which is called by the web accessible
path /categoriesServlet performs string interpolation and direct SQL
query execution. SQL quote escaping and a keyword blacklist were
implemented in a new class, SQLUtil
(main/java/com/dotmarketing/common/util/SQLUtil.java), as part of the
remediation of CVE-2016-8902; however, these can be overcome in the
case of the q and inode parameters to the /categoriesServlet path.
Overcoming these controls permits a number of blind boolean SQL
injection vectors in either parameter. The /categoriesServlet web path
can be accessed remotely and without authentication in a default dotCMS
deployment.
