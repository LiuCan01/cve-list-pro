In version 3.5 and prior of Cambium Networks ePMP firmware, a lack of
input sanitation for certain parameters on the web management console
allows any authenticated user (including the otherwise low-privilege
readonly user) to inject shell meta-characters as part of a
specially-crafted POST request to the get_chart function and run
OS-level commands, effectively as root.
