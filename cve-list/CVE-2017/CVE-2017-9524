The qemu-nbd server in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator), when built with the
Network Block Device (NBD) Server support, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and server crash) by
leveraging failure to ensure that all initialization occurs before
talking to a client in the nbd_negotiate function.
