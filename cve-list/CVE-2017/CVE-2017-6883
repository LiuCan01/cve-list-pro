The ConvertToPDF plugin in Foxit Reader before 8.2.1 and PhantomPDF
before 8.2.1 on Windows, when the gflags app is enabled, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
application crash) via a crafted TIFF image. The vulnerability could
lead to information disclosure; an attacker can leverage this in
conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context
of the current process.
