A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MantisBT (2.3.x
before 2.3.2) Timeline include page, used in My View (my_view_page.php)
and User Information (view_user_page.php) pages, allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary code (if CSP settings permit it) through
crafted PATH_INFO in a URL, due to use of unsanitized
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] to generate URLs.
