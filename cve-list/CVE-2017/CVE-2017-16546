The ReadWPGImage function in coders/wpg.c in ImageMagick 7.0.7-9 does
not properly validate the colormap index in a WPG palette, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use of uninitialized
data or invalid memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a malformed WPG file.
