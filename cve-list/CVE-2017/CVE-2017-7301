The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, has an aout_link_add_symbols function in
bfd/aoutx.h that has an off-by-one vulnerability because it does not
carefully check the string offset. The vulnerability could lead to a
GNU linker (ld) program crash.
