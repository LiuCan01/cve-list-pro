In Adam Kropelin adk0212 APC UPS Daemon through 3.14.14, the default
installation of APCUPSD allows a local authenticated, but unprivileged,
user to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges by replacing the
service executable apcupsd.exe with a malicious executable that will
run with SYSTEM privileges at startup. This occurs because of "RW NT
AUTHORITYAuthenticated Users" permissions for
%SYSTEMDRIVE%apcupsdbinapcupsd.exe.
