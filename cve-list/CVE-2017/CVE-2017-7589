In OpenIDM through 4.0.0 before 4.5.0, the info endpoint may leak
sensitive information upon a request by the "anonymous" user, as
demonstrated by responses with a 200 HTTP status code and a JSON object
containing IP address strings. This is related to a missing
access-control check in bin/defaults/script/info/login.js.
