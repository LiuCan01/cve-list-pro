A vulnerability in the guest shell feature of Cisco NX-OS System
Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read and send
packets outside the scope of the guest shell container. An attacker
would need valid administrator credentials to perform this attack. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient internal security measures in the
guest shell feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending or receiving packets on the device-internal network outside of
the guest shell container, aka "Unauthorized Internal Interface
Access." This vulnerability affects the following products running
Cisco NX-OS System Software: Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 9000
Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line
Cards and Fabric Modules. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf33038.
