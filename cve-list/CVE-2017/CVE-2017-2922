An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket
protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted
websocket packet can cause a buffer to be allocated while leaving
stale pointers which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability which can
be exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker needs to
send a specially crafted websocket packet over the network to trigger
this vulnerability.
