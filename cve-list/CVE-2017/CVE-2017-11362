In PHP 7.x before 7.0.21 and 7.1.x before 7.1.7,
ext/intl/msgformat/msgformat_parse.c does not restrict the locale
length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact within International Components for Unicode
(ICU) for C/C++ via a long first argument to the msgfmt_parse_message
function.
