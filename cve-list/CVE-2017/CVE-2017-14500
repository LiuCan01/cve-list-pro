Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command in
the podcast playback function of Podbeuter in Newsbeuter 0.3 through
2.9 allows remote attackers to perform user-assisted code execution by
crafting an RSS item with a media enclosure (i.e., a podcast file) that
includes shell metacharacters in its filename, related to
pb_controller.cpp and queueloader.cpp, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2017-12904.
