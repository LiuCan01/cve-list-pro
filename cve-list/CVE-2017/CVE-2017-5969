** DISPUTED ** libxml2 2.9.4, when used in recover mode, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via
a crafted XML document.  NOTE: The maintainer states "I would disagree
of a CVE with the Recover parsing option which should only be used for
manual recovery at least for XML parser."
