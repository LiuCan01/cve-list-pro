Name: CVE-2017-11136
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11136
Phase: Assigned (20170709)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/90

An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. It
uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages.
However, the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but
transmitted to the backend, too. Moreover, the key to decrypt the
private key is composed of the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of
the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend, too.
Therefore, everyone with access to the backend database can read the
transmitted secret for symmetric encryption, hence can read the
communication.
