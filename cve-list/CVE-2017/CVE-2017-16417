An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This
vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that
is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is a part of the
font parsing module. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer
offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the
vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.
