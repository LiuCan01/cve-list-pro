Skybox Manager Client Application prior to 8.5.501 is prone to an
arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient input
validation of user-supplied files path when uploading files via the
application. During a debugger-pause state, a local authenticated
attacker can upload an arbitrary file and overwrite existing files
within the scope of the affected application.
