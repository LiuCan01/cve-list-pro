** DISPUTED ** delphi_gui/WWWBrowserRunnerDM.pas in PasDoc 0.14 does
not validate strings before launching the program specified by the
BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to
conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software
maintainer has indicated that the code referencing the BROWSER
environment variable is never used.
