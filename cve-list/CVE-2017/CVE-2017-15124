VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) 2.11.0 and older
was found to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as
it did not throttle the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the
client did not consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing
memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use
this flaw to cause DoS to the server host.
