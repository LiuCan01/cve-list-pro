An untrusted search path (aka DLL Preloading) vulnerability in the
Cisco Immunet antimalware installer could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to execute arbitrary code via DLL hijacking if a local user
with administrative privileges executes the installer in the current
working directory where a crafted DLL has been placed by an attacker.
The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of path and
file names of a DLL file before it is loaded. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by creating a malicious DLL file and installing it
in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host
with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM account. An attacker would
need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvf23928.
