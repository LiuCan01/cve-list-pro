A resource-permission flaw was found in the
openstack-tripleo-heat-templates package where
ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local
attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph
cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack
service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack
Block Storage volume.
