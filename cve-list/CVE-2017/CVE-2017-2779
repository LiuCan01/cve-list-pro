An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the RSRC
segment parsing functionality of LabVIEW 2017, LabVIEW 2016, LabVIEW
2015, and LabVIEW 2014.  A specially crafted Virtual Instrument (VI)
file can cause an attacker controlled looping condition resulting in
an arbitrary null write.  An attacker controlled VI file can be used
to trigger this vulnerability and can potentially result in code
execution.
