A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management
Controller (IMC) 3.0(1c) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system. The vulnerability
exists because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize
user-supplied HTTP input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by sending an HTTP POST request that contains crafted, deserialized
user data to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges
on the affected system, which the attacker could use to conduct further
attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14591.
