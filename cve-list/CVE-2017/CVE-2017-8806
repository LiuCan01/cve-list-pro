The Debian pg_ctlcluster, pg_createcluster, and pg_upgradecluster
scripts, as distributed in the Debian postgresql-common package before
181+deb9u1 for PostgreSQL (and other packages related to Debian and
Ubuntu), handled symbolic links insecurely, which could result in local
denial of service by overwriting arbitrary files.
