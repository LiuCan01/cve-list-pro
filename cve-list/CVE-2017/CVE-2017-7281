An issue was discovered in Unitrends Enterprise Backup before 9.1.2. A
lack of sanitization of user input in the createReportName and
saveReport functions in recoveryconsole/bpl/reports.php allows for an
authenticated user to create a randomly named file on disk with a
user-controlled extension, contents, and path, leading to remote code
execution, aka Unrestricted File Upload.
