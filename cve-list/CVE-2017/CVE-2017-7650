In Mosquitto before 1.4.12, pattern based ACLs can be bypassed by
clients that set their username/client id to '#' or '+'. This allows
locally or remotely connected clients to access MQTT topics that they
do have the rights to. The same issue may be present in third party
authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.
