An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML loading functionality
of util.py in OwlMixin before 2.0.0a12. A "Load YAML" string or file
(aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands
resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load
should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML
to trigger this vulnerability.
