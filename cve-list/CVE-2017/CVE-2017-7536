In Hibernate Validator 5.2.x before 5.2.5 final, 5.3.x, and 5.4.x, it
was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions,
which allows it to access the private members of the class, are
granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can
occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members
without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid
instance and access the private member value via
ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue().
