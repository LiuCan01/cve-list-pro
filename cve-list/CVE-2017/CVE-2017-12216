A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco SocialMiner
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to have read and write
access to information stored in the affected system. The vulnerability
is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when
parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted
XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read
and write files and execute remote code within the application. Cisco
