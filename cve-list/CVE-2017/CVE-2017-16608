This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Netgain Enterprise Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The
specific flaw exists within exec.jsp. The issue results from the lack
of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to
execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
execute code under the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-4749.
