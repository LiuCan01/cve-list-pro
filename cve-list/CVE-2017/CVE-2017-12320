Multiple vulnerabilities in the web interface of the Cisco Registered
Envelope Service (a cloud-based service) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or redirect a user of the affected service to an undesired
web page. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the
affected service. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by
persuading a user to click a malicious link or by sending an HTTP
request that could cause the affected service to redirect the request
to a specified malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web
interface of the affected system or allow the attacker to access
sensitive browser-based information on the affected system. These types
of exploits could also be used in phishing attacks that send users to
malicious websites without their knowledge. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77195,
CSCve90978, CSCvf42310, CSCvf42703, CSCvf42723, CSCvf46169, CSCvf49999.
