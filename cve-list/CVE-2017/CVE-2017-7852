D-Link DCS cameras have a weak/insecure CrossDomain.XML file that
allows sites hosting malicious Flash objects to access and/or change
the device's settings via a CSRF attack. This is because of the
'allow-access-from domain' child element set to *, thus accepting
requests from any domain. If a victim logged into the camera's web
console visits a malicious site hosting a malicious Flash file from
another Browser tab, the malicious Flash file then can send requests to
the victim's DCS series Camera without knowing the credentials. An
attacker can host a malicious Flash file that can retrieve Live Feeds
or information from the victim's DCS series Camera, add new admin
users, or make other changes to the device. Known affected devices are
DCS-933L with firmware before 1.13.05, DCS-5030L, DCS-5020L, DCS-2530L,
DCS-2630L, DCS-930L, DCS-932L, and DCS-932LB1.
