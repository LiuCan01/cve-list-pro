Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has Reflected XSS in launchHelp.cgi. The
helpLaunchPage parameter is reflected in an IFRAME element, if the
value contains two quotes. It properly sanitizes quotes and tags, so
one cannot simply close the src with a quote and inject after that.
However, an attacker can use javascript: or data: to abuse this.
