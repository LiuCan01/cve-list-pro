The bm_readbody_bmp function in bitmap_io.c in Potrace 1.14 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
over-read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a crafted BMP image. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8698.
