When a cluster is operating in secure mode, a user with read
privileges for specific data regions can use the gfsh command line
utility to execute queries. In Apache Geode before 1.2.1, the query
results may contain data from another user's concurrently executing
gfsh query, potentially revealing data that the user is not authorized
to view.
