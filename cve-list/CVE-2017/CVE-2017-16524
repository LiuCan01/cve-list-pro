Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices suffers from an
Unrestricted file upload vulnerability: 'network_ssl_upload.php' allows
remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code
via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a
direct request to the file in the upload/ directory. To authenticate
for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext
by leveraging the existing Local File Read Vulnerability referenced as
CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the web-interface
credentials via a request for the
cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.
