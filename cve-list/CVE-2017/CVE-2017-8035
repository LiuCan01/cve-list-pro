An issue was discovered in the Cloud Controller API in Cloud Foundry
Foundation CAPI-release versions after v1.6.0 and prior to v1.35.0 and
cf-release versions after v244 and prior to v268. A carefully crafted
CAPI request from a Space Developer can allow them to gain access to
files on the Cloud Controller VM for that installation.
