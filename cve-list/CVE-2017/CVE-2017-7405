On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, once authenticated, this
device identifies the user based on the IP address of his machine. By
spoofing the IP address belonging to the victim's host, an attacker
might be able to take over the administrative session without being
prompted for authentication credentials. An attacker can get the
victim's and router's IP addresses by simply sniffing the network
traffic. Moreover, if the victim has web access enabled on his router
and is accessing the web interface from a different network that is
behind the NAT/Proxy, an attacker can sniff the network traffic to know
the public IP address of the victim's router and take over his session
as he won't be prompted for credentials.
