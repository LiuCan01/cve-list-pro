Reference: FULLDISC:20171219 Multiple Vulnerabilities in TP-Link TL-SG108E - CVE-2017-17745, CVE-2017-17746, CVE-2017-17747
Reference: URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Dec/67

Weak access control methods on the TP-Link TL-SG108E 1.0.0 allow any
user on a NAT network with an authenticated administrator to access
the device without entering user credentials. The authentication
record is stored on the device; thus if an administrator authenticates
from a NAT network, the authentication applies to the IP address of
the NAT gateway, and any user behind that NAT gateway is also treated
as authenticated.
