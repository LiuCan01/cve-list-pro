In Horde_Crypt before 2.7.6, as used in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition
5.x through 5.2.17, OS Command Injection can occur if the user has PGP
features enabled in the user's preferences, and has enabled the "Should
PGP signed messages be automatically verified when viewed?" preference.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send a PGP signed email
(that is maliciously crafted) to the Horde user, who then must either
view or preview it.
