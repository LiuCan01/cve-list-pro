A malicious X-ProxyContextPath or X-Forwarded-Context header
containing external resources or embedded code could cause remote code
execution. The fix to properly handle these headers was applied on the
Apache NiFi 1.5.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should
upgrade to the appropriate release.
