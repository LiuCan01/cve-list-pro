This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.2.0.2051. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the saveAs JavaScript function. The issue
results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
which can lead to writing arbitrary files into attacker controlled
locations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code
under the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-4518.
