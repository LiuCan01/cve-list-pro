When the 'bgp-error-tolerance' feature &#xe2;&#x80;" designed to help
mitigate remote session resets from malformed path attributes
&#xe2;&#x80;" is enabled, a BGP UPDATE containing a specifically
crafted set of transitive attributes can cause the RPD routing process
to crash and restart. Devices with BGP enabled that do not have
'bgp-error-tolerance' configured are not vulnerable to this issue.
