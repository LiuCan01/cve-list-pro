In TinyWebGallery v2.4, an XSS vulnerability is located in the
`mkname`, `mkitem`, and `item` parameters of the `Add/Create` module.
Remote attackers with low-privilege user accounts for backend access
are able to inject malicious script codes into the `TWG Explorer` item
listing. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is
located on the application-side of the service. The injection point is
the add/create input field and the execution point occurs in the item
listing after the add or create.
