A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Mobility Express 1800
Series Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
bypass authentication. The attacker could be granted full administrator
privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of
authentication for accessing certain web pages using the GUI interface.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP
request to the web interface of the affected system. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and perform
unauthorized configuration changes or issue control commands to the
affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Mobility Express 1800
Series Access Points running a software version prior to 8.2.110.0.
