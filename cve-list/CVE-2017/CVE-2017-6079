The HTTP web-management application on Edgewater Networks Edgemarc
appliances has a hidden page that allows for user-defined commands such
as specific iptables routes, etc., to be set. You can use this page as
a web shell essentially to execute commands, though you get no feedback
client-side from the web application: if the command is valid, it
executes. An example is the wget command. The page that allows this has
been confirmed in firmware as old as 2006.
