coffgen.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as
distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, does not validate the symbol count,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer
overflow and application crash, or excessive memory allocation) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file.
