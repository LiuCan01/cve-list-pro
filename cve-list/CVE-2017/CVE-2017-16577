This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the alignment attribute of Field objects.
The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an
object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the
current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5094.
