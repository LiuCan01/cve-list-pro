The Symantec Messaging Gateway can encounter a file inclusion
vulnerability, which is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly
found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time.
This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable
code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the
attacker to control which file is executed at run time. This file
inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for
execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability
will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the
affected web application.
