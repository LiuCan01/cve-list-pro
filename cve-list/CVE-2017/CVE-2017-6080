An issue was discovered in Zammad before 1.0.4, 1.1.x before 1.1.3, and
1.2.x before 1.2.1, caused by lack of a protection mechanism involving
HTTP Access-Control headers. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker
can send cross-domain requests directly to the REST API for users with
a valid session cookie and receive the result.
