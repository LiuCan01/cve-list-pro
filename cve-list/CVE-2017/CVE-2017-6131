In some circumstances, an F5 BIG-IP version 12.0.0 to 12.1.2 and
13.0.0 Azure cloud instance may contain a default administrative
password which could be used to remotely log into the BIG-IP system.
The impacted administrative account is the Azure instance
administrative user that was created at deployment. The root and admin
accounts are not vulnerable. An attacker may be able to remotely
access the BIG-IP host via SSH.
