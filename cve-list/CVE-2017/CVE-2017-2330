A denial of service vulnerability in Juniper Networks NorthStar
Controller Application prior to version 2.1.0 Service Pack 1 may allow
an unauthenticated, local user, to create a fork bomb scenario, also
known as a rabbit virus, or wabbit, which will create processes that
replicate themselves, until all resources are consumed on the system,
leading to a denial of service to the entire system until it is
restarted. Continued attacks by an unauthenticated, local user, can
lead to persistent denials of services.
