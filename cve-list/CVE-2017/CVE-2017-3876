A vulnerability in the Event Management Service daemon (emsd) of Cisco
IOS XR routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The
vulnerability is due to improper handling of gRPC requests. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly sending unauthenticated
gRPC requests to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to crash the device in such a manner that manual
intervention is required to recover. This vulnerability affects all
Cisco IOS XR platforms that are running release 6.1.1 of Cisco IOS XR
Software when the gRPC service is enabled on the device. The gRPC
service is not enabled by default. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb14441.
