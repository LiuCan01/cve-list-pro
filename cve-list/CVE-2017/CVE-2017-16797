Reference: MISC:https://github.com/matthiaskramm/swftools/issues/51

In SWFTools 0.9.2, the png_load function in lib/png.c does not properly
validate an alloclen_64 multiplication of width and height values,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer
overflow, heap-based buffer overflow, and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PNG file.
