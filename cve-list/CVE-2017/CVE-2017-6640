A vulnerability in Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)
Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to
the administrative console of a DCNM server by using an account that
has a default, static password. The account could be granted root- or
system-level privileges. The vulnerability exists because the affected
software has a default user account that has a default, static
password. The user account is created automatically when the software
is installed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
connecting remotely to an affected system and logging in to the
affected software by using the credentials for this default user
account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use this
default user account to log in to the affected software and gain access
to the administrative console of a DCNM server. This vulnerability
affects Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software
releases prior to Release 10.2(1) for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and
Virtual Appliance platforms. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd95346.
