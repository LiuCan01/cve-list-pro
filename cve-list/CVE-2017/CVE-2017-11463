In LANDESK Management Suite 2016.4 and 2017.x, an Unrestricted Direct
Object Reference leads to referencing/updating objects belonging to
other users. In other words, a normal user can send requests to a
specific URI with the target user's username in an HTTP payload in
order to retrieve a key/token and use it to access/update objects
belonging to other users. Such objects could be user profiles, tickets,
incidents, etc.
