A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge
improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt
memory in a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the
current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative
user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An
attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
create new accounts with full user rights.
