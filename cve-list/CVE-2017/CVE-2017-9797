When an Apache Geode cluster before v1.2.1 is operating in secure
mode, an unauthenticated client can enter multi-user authentication
mode and send metadata messages. These metadata operations could leak
information about application data types. In addition, an attacker
could perform a denial of service attack on the cluster.
