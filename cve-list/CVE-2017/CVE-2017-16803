In Libav through 11.11 and 12.x through 12.1, the smacker_decode_tree
function in libavcodec/smacker.c does not properly restrict tree
recursion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(bitstream.c:build_table() out-of-bounds read and application crash)
via a crafted Smacker stream.
