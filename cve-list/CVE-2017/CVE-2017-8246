In function msm_pcm_playback_close() in all Android releases from CAF
using the Linux kernel, prtd is assigned
substream->runtime->private_data. Later, prtd is freed. However, prtd
is not sanitized and set to NULL, resulting in a dangling pointer.
There are other functions that access the same memory
(substream->runtime->private_data) with a NULL check, such as
msm_pcm_volume_ctl_put(), which means this freed memory could be used.
