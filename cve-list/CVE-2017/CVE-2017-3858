A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco IOS XE Software could
allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands
that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient input validation of HTTP parameters supplied by the user.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
device and submitting crafted input to the affected web page parameter.
The user must be authenticated to access the affected parameter. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with
root privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices running Cisco
IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1, if the HTTP Server feature is enabled
for the device. The newly redesigned, web-based administration
interface was introduced in the Denali 16.2 Release of Cisco IOS XE
Software. The web-based administration interface in earlier releases of
Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCuy83069.
