Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) did not
restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by
default. During the deserialization process code is executed that for
several known types has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown types
may also exhibit such behaviors. One vector in the Java standard
library exists that allows an attacker to trigger possibly further
exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted data. Other known
vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code
execution.
