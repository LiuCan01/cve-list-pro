Reference: FULLDISC:20171219 CVE-2017-6094 - Genexis GAPS Access Control Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Dec/62

CPEs used by subscribers on the access network receive their
individual configuration settings from a central GAPS instance. A CPE
identifies itself by the MAC address of its WAN interface and a
certain "chk" value (48bit) derived from the MAC. The algorithm used
to compute the "chk" was disclosed by reverse engineering the CPE's
firmware. As a result, it is possible to forge valid "chk" values for
any given MAC address and therefore receive the configuration settings
of other subscribers' CPEs. The configuration settings often contain
sensitive values, for example credentials (username/password) for VoIP
services. This issue affects Genexis B.V. GAPS up to 7.2.
