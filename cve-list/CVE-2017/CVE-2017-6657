Cisco Sourcefire Snort 3.0 before build 233 mishandles Ether Type
Validation. Since valid ether type and IP protocol numbers do not
overlap, Snort++ stores all protocol decoders in a single array. That
makes it possible to craft packets that have IP protocol numbers in the
ether type field which will confuse the Snort++ decoder. For example,
an eth:llc:snap:icmp6 packet will cause a crash because there is no ip6
header with which to calculate the icmp6 checksum. Affected decoders
include gre, llc, trans_bridge, ciscometadata, linux_sll, and
token_ring. The fix adds a check in the packet manager to validate the
ether type before indexing the decoder array. An out of range ether
type will raise 116:473.
