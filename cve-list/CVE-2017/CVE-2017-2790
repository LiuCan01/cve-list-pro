When processing a record type of 0x3c from a Workbook stream from an
Excel file (.xls), JustSystems Ichitaro Office trusts that the size is
greater than zero, subtracts one from the length, and uses this result
as the size for a memcpy. This results in a heap-based buffer overflow
and can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
