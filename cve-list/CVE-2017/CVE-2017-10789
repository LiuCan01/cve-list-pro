The DBD::mysql module through 4.043 for Perl uses the mysql_ssl=1
setting to mean that SSL is optional (even though this setting's
documentation has a "your communication with the server will be
encrypted" statement), which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
spoof servers via a cleartext-downgrade attack, a related issue to
CVE-2015-3152.
