Several REST service endpoints of Apache Archiva are not protected
against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A malicious site
opened in the same browser as the archiva site, may send an HTML
response that performs arbitrary actions on archiva services, with the
same rights as the active archiva session (e.g. administrator rights).
