** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. A secondary authentication system is available for
Installers called the Grid Guard system. This system uses predictable
codes, and a single Grid Guard code can be used on any SMA inverter.
Any such code, when combined with the installer account, allows
changing very sensitive parameters. NOTE: the vendor reports that Grid
Guard is not an authentication feature; it is only a tracing feature.
Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and
TL-30 could potentially be affected.
