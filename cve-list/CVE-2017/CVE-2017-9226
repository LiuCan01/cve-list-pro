An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap
out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular
expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled
correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular
expression containing an octal number in the form of '700' would
produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in
next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory
corruption.
