A vulnerability in the Device Manager web interface of Cisco Industrial
Ethernet 1000 Series Switches 1.3 could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack
against a user of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient CSRF protection by the Device Manager web interface. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
interface to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled
website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit
arbitrary requests to an affected device via the Device Manager web
interface and with the privileges of the user. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc88811.
