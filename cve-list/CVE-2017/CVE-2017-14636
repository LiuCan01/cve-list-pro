Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues/14

Because of an integer overflow in sam2p 0.49.3, a loop executes
0xffffffff times, ending with an invalid read of size 1 in the
Image::Indexed::sortPal function in image.cpp. However, this also
causes memory corruption because of an attempted write to the invalid
d[0xfffffffe] array element.
