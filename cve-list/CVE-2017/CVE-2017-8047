In Cloud Foundry router routing-release all versions prior to v0.163.0
and cf-release all versions prior to v274, in some applications, it is
possible to append a combination of characters to the URL that will
allow for an open redirect. An attacker could exploit this as a
phishing attack to gain access to user credentials or other sensitive
data. NOTE: 274 resolves the vulnerability but has a serious bug that
is fixed in 275.
