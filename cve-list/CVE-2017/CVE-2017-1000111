Linux kernel: heap out-of-bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue
is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a
socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in
packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with
PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the
update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further.
As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in
the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any
process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.
