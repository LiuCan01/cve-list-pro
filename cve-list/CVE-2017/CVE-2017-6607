A vulnerability in the DNS code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload
or corrupt the information present in the device's local DNS cache. The
vulnerability is due to a flaw in handling crafted DNS response
messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering a
DNS request from the Cisco ASA Software and replying with a crafted
response. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload,
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or corruption of the
local DNS cache information. Note: Only traffic directed to the
affected device can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This
vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed or
transparent firewall mode and single or multiple context mode. This
vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This
vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software running on the following
products: Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Cisco ASA 5500 Series
Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation
Firewalls, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series
Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual
Appliance (ASAv), Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module, Cisco ISA
3000 Industrial Security Appliance. Fixed versions: 9.1(7.12) 9.2(4.18)
9.4(3.12) 9.5(3.2) 9.6(2.2). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb40898.
