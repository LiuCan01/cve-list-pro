An issue was discovered in the size of the default stack guard page on
PAX Linux (originally from GRSecurity but shipped by other Linux
vendors), specifically the default stack guard page is not
sufficiently large and can be "jumped" over (the stack guard page is
bypassed), this affects PAX Linux Kernel versions as of June 19, 2017
(specific version information is not available at this time).
