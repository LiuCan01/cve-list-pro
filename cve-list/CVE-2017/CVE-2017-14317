A domain cleanup issue was discovered in the C xenstore daemon (aka
cxenstored) in Xen through 4.9.x. When shutting down a VM with a
stubdomain, a race in cxenstored may cause a double-free. The xenstored
daemon may crash, resulting in a DoS of any parts of the system relying
on it (including domain creation / destruction, ballooning, device
changes, etc.).
