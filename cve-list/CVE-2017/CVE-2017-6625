A "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense 6.0.0 through 6.2.2 and Cisco ASA
with FirePOWER Module Denial of Service" vulnerability in the access
control policy of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected system to stop
inspecting and processing packets, resulting in a denial of service
(DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper SSL policy
handling by the affected software when packets are passed through the
sensing interfaces of an affected system. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through a targeted
system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software that
is configured with the SSL policy feature. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc84361.
