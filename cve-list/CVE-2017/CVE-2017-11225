An issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player 27.0.0.183 and earlier
versions. This vulnerability is an instance of a use after free
vulnerability in the Primetime SDK metadata functionality. The mismatch
between an old and a new object can provide an attacker with unintended
memory access -- potentially leading to code corruption, control-flow
hijack, or an information leak attack. Successful exploitation could
lead to arbitrary code execution.
