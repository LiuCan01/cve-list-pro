A Stack-based Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in WECON LEVI Studio
HMI Editor v1.8.1 and prior. Multiple stack-based buffer overflow
vulnerabilities have been identified in which the application does not
verify string size before copying to memory; the attacker may then be
able to crash the application or run arbitrary code.
