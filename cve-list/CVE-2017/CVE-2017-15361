The Infineon RSA library 1.02.013 in Infineon Trusted Platform Module
(TPM) firmware, such as versions before 0000000000000422 - 4.34, before
000000000000062b - 6.43, and before 0000000000008521 - 133.33,
mishandles RSA key generation, which makes it easier for attackers to
defeat various cryptographic protection mechanisms via targeted
attacks, aka ROCA. Examples of affected technologies include BitLocker
with TPM 1.2, YubiKey 4 (before 4.3.5) PGP key generation, and the
Cached User Data encryption feature in Chrome OS.
