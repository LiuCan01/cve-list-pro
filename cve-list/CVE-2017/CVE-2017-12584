Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/slims/slims8_akasia/issues/49

There is no CSRF mitigation in SLiMS 8 Akasia through 8.3.1. Also, an
entire user profile (including the password) can be updated without
sending the current password. This allows remote attackers to trick a
user into changing to an attacker-controlled password, a complete
account takeover, via the passwd1 and passwd2 fields in an
admin/modules/system/app_user.php changecurrent=true operation.
