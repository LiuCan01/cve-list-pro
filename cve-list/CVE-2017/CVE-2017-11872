Microsoft Edge in Microsoft Windows 10 1607, 1703, and Windows Server
2016 allows an attacker to force the browser to send data that would
otherwise be restricted to a destination website of the attacker's
choice, due to how Microsoft Edge handles redirect requests, aka
"Microsoft Edge Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability". This CVE ID is
unique from CVE-2017-11863 and CVE-2017-11874.
