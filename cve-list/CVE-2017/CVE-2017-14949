Restlet Framework before 2.3.12 allows remote attackers to access
arbitrary files via a crafted REST API HTTP request that conducts an
XXE attack, because only general external entities (not parameter
external entities) are properly considered. This is related to
XmlRepresentation, DOMRepresentation, SaxRepresentation, and
JacksonRepresentation.
