A vulnerability in the TCP state machine of Cisco RF Gateway 1 devices
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent an affected
device from delivering switched digital video (SDV) or video on demand
(VoD) streams, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to a processing error with TCP connections to the
affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
establishing a large number of TCP connections to an affected device
and not actively closing those TCP connections. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to prevent the affected device from delivering
SDV or VoD streams to set-top boxes. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf19887.
