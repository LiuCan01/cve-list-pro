It was found that FreeIPA 4.2.0 and later could disclose password
hashes to users having the 'System: Read Stage Users' permission. A
remote, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to
disclose the password hashes belonging to Stage Users. This security
issue does not result in disclosure of password hashes belonging to
active standard users.
