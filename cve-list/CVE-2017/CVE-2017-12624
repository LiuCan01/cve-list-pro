Apache CXF supports sending and receiving attachments via either the
JAX-WS or JAX-RS specifications. It is possible to craft a message
attachment header that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
on a CXF web service provider. Both JAX-WS and JAX-RS services are
vulnerable to this attack. From Apache CXF 3.2.1 and 3.1.14, message
attachment headers that are greater than 300 characters will be
rejected by default. This value is configurable via the property
"attachment-max-header-size".
