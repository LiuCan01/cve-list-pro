An issue was discovered in the PoodLL Filter plugin through 3.0.20 for
Moodle. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data in the "poodll_audio_url" HTTP GET parameter passed
to the
"filter_poodll_moodle32_2016112802/poodll/mp3recorderskins/brazil/index.php"
URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
