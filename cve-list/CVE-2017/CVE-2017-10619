Phase: Assigned (20170628)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10821

When Express Path (formerly known as service offloading) is configured
on Juniper Networks SRX1400, SRX3400, SRX3600, SRX5400, SRX5600,
SRX5800 in high availability cluster configuration mode, certain
multicast packets might cause the flowd process to crash, halting or
interrupting traffic from flowing through the device and triggering
RG1+ (data-plane) fail-over to the secondary node. Repeated crashes of
the flowd process may constitute an extended denial of service
condition. This service is not enabled by default and is only
supported in high-end SRX platforms. Affected releases are Juniper
Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D45, 15.1X49 prior to
15.1X49-D80 on SRX1400, SRX3400, SRX3600, SRX5400, SRX5600, SRX5800.
