An active network attacker (MiTM) can achieve remote code execution on
a machine that runs IKARUS Anti Virus 2.16.7. IKARUS AV for Windows
uses cleartext HTTP for updates along with a CRC32 checksum and an
update value for verification of the downloaded files. The attacker
first forces the client to initiate an update transaction by modifying
an update field within an HTTP 200 response, so that it refers to a
nonexistent update. The attacker then modifies the HTTP 404 response so
that it specifies a successfully found update, with a Trojan horse
executable file (e.g., guardxup.exe) and the correct CRC32 checksum for
that file.
