The scp_v0s_accept function in sesman/libscp/libscp_v0.c in the session
manager in xrdp through 0.9.4 uses an untrusted integer as a write
length, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer
overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a crafted input stream.
