Norton Remove & Reinstall can be susceptible to a DLL preloading
vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an application looks
to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL
to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it
will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The
vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially
an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the
context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update,
version 4.4.0.58, has been released which addresses the aforementioned
vulnerability.
