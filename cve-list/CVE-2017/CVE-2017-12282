A vulnerability in the Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) ingress
frame processing functionality of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could
allow an unauthenticated, Layer 2 RF-adjacent attacker to cause an
affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input
validation of ANQP query frames by the affected device. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed ANQP query
frame to an affected device that is on an RF-adjacent network. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected
device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. This
vulnerability affects Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers that are running a
vulnerable release of Cisco WLC Software and are configured to support
Hotspot 2.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve05779.
