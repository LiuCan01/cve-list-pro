'/cgi-bin/admin/downloadMedias.cgi' of the web service in most of the
VIVOTEK Network Cameras is vulnerable, which allows remote attackers to

request containing ".." sequences. This vulnerability is already
verified on VIVOTEK Network Camera IB8369/FD8164/FD816BA; most others
have similar firmware that may be affected.
