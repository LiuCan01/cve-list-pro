A race condition in Guacamole's terminal emulator in versions 0.9.5
through 0.9.10-incubating could allow writes of blocks of printed data
to overlap. Such overlapping writes could cause packet data to be
misread as the packet length, resulting in the remaining data being
written beyond the end of a statically-allocated buffer.
