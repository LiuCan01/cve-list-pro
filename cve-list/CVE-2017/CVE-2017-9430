Stack-based buffer overflow in dnstracer through 1.9 allows attackers
to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a command line with a long name argument
that is mishandled in a strcpy call for argv[0]. An example threat
model is a web application that launches dnstracer with an untrusted
name string.
