bfd/vms-alpha.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as
demonstrated by mishandling of this file in the _bfd_vms_get_value and
_bfd_vms_slurp_etir functions during "objdump -D" execution.
