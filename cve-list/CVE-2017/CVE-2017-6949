An issue was discovered in CHICKEN Scheme through 4.12.0. When using a
nonstandard CHICKEN-specific extension to allocate an SRFI-4 vector in
unmanaged memory, the vector size would be used in unsanitised form as
an argument to malloc(). With an unexpected size, the impact may have
been a segfault or buffer overflow.
