Wolf CMS 0.8.3.1 allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The
vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the file name
in a "create-file-popup" action, and the directory name in a
"create-directory-popup" action, in the HTTP POST method to the
"/plugin/file_manager/" script (aka an
/admin/plugin/file_manager/browse// URI).
