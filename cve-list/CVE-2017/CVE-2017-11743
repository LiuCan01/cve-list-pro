MEDHOST Connex contains a hard-coded Mirth Connect admin credential
that is used for customer Mirth Connect management access. An attacker
with knowledge of the hard-coded credential and the ability to
communicate directly with the Mirth Connect management console may be
able to intercept sensitive patient information. The admin account
password is hard-coded as $K8t1ng throughout the application, and is
the same across all installations. Customers do not have the option to
change the Mirth Connect admin account password. The Mirth Connect
admin account is created during the Connex install. The plaintext
account password is hard-coded multiple times in the Connex install and
update scripts.
