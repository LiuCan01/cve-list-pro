The default installation of DocuWare Fulltext Search server through
6.11 allows remote users to connect to and download searchable text
from the embedded Solr service, bypassing DocuWare's access control
features of the DocuWare user interfaces and API. An attacker can also
gain privileges by modifying text. The default installation is unsafe
because the server listens on the network interface, not the localhost
interface.
