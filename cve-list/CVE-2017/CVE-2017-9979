On the OSNEXUS QuantaStor v4 virtual appliance before 4.3.1, if the
REST call invoked does not exist, an error will be triggered
containing the invalid method previously invoked. The response sent to
the user isn't sanitized in this case. An attacker can leverage this
issue by including arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code as a parameter,
aka XSS.
