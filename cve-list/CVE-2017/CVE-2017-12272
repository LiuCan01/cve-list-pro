A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco IOS XE Software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of the
affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the
affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
convincing a user of the web interface to access a malicious link or by
intercepting a user request for the affected web interface and
injecting malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of
the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive
browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb09516.
