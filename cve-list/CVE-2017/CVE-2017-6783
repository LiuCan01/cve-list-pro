A vulnerability in SNMP polling for the Cisco Web Security Appliance
(WSA), Email Security Appliance (ESA), and Content Security Management
Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
discover confidential information about the appliances that should be
available only to an administrative user. The vulnerability occurs
because the appliances do not protect confidential information at rest
in response to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) poll
requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing a
crafted SNMP poll request to the targeted security appliance. An
exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information
that should be restricted, and the attacker could use this information
to conduct additional reconnaissance. The attacker must know the
configured SNMP community string to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco
Bug IDs: CSCve26106, CSCve26202, CSCve26224. Known Affected Releases:
10.0.0-230 (Web Security Appliance), 9.7.2-065 (Email Security
Appliance), and 10.1.0-037 (Content Security Management Appliance).
