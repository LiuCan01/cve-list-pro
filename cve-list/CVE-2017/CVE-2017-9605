The vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl function (accessible via
DRM_IOCTL_VMW_GB_SURFACE_CREATE) in
drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through
4.11.4 defines a backup_handle variable but does not give it an initial
value. If one attempts to create a GB surface, with a previously
allocated DMA buffer to be used as a backup buffer, the backup_handle
variable does not get written to and is then later returned to user
space, allowing local users to obtain sensitive information from
uninitialized kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.
