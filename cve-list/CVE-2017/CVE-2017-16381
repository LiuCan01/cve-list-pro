An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The
vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length
value when processing TIFF files embedded within an XPS document.
Crafted TIFF image input causes a mismatch between allocated buffer
size and the access allowed by the computation. If an attacker can
adequately control the accessible memory then this vulnerability can be
leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.
