In libavformat/asfdec_f.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in
asf_build_simple_index() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check
might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted ASF file, which claims
a large "ict" field in the header but does not contain sufficient
backing data, is provided, the for loop would consume huge CPU and
memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.
