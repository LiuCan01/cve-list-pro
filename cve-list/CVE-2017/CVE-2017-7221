OpenText Documentum Content Server has an inadequate protection
mechanism against SQL injection, which allows remote authenticated
users to execute arbitrary code with super-user privileges by
leveraging the availability of the dm_bp_transition docbase method with
a user-created dm_procedure object, as demonstrated by use of a
backspace character in an injected string. NOTE: this vulnerability
exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2513.
