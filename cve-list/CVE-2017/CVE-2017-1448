IBM Emptoris Supplier Lifecycle Management 10.0.x and 10.1.x could
allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open
redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted
Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof
the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that
would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain
highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the
victim. IBM X-Force ID: 128173.
