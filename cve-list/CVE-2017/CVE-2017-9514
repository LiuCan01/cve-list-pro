Bamboo before 6.0.5, 6.1.x before 6.1.4, and 6.2.x before 6.2.1 had a
REST endpoint that parsed a YAML file and did not sufficiently
restrict which classes could be loaded. An attacker who can log in to
Bamboo as a user is able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java
code of their choice on systems that have vulnerable versions of
Bamboo.
