This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the value attribute of Field objects. The
issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object
prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage
this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current
process. Was ZDI-CAN-4980.
