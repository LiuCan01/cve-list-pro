A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) on the Cisco
TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition on the targeted appliance. The vulnerability is due to
excessive SIP traffic sent to the device. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by transmitting large volumes of SIP traffic to the
VCS. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a complete DoS
condition on the targeted system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve32897.
