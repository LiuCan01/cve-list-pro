Git Plugin connects to a user-specified Git repository as part of form
validation. An attacker with no direct access to Jenkins but able to
guess at a username/password credentials ID could trick a developer
with job configuration permissions into following a link with a
maliciously crafted Jenkins URL which would result in the Jenkins Git
client sending the username and password to an attacker-controlled
server.
