An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. A remote attacker can
obtain cleartext content by sending an encrypted data block (that the
attacker cannot directly decrypt) to a victim, and relying on the
victim to automatically decrypt that block and then send it back to the
attacker as quoted text, aka the TBE-01-005 "replay" issue.
