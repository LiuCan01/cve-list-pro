A vulnerability in the Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) ingress
frame-processing functionality of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause one of the LPTS processes on
an affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a brief denial
of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete LPTS
frame validation by the affected software. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending crafted XML requests to the management
interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to cause one of the LPTS processes on the affected system to
restart unexpectedly, which would impact LPTS traffic and cause a brief
DoS condition while the process restarts. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf76332.
