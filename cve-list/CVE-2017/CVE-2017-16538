drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/lmedm04.c in the Linux kernel through
4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (general
protection fault and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a crafted USB device, related to a missing warm-start check
and incorrect attach timing (dm04_lme2510_frontend_attach versus
dm04_lme2510_tuner).
