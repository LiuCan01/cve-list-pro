Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a creation of
folders in read-only folders despite lacking permissions issue. Due to
a logical error in the file caching layer an authenticated adversary
is able to create empty folders inside a shared folder. Note that this
only affects folders and files that the adversary has at least
read-only permissions for.
