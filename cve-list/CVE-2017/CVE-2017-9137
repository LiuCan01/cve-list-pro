Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 wireless radios through 7.2.0 have a default
password of mateidu for the mateidu account (a hidden user account
established by the vendor). This account can be accessed via both the
web interface and SSH. In the web interface, this simply grants an
attacker read-only access to the device's settings. However, when
using SSH, this gives an attacker access to a Linux shell. NOTE: the
vendor has commented "The mateidu user is a known user, which is
mentioned in the FibeAir IP-10 User Guide. Customers are instructed to
change the mateidu user password. Changing the user password fully
solves the vulnerability."
