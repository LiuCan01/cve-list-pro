Multiple client-side cross site scripting vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the WpJobBoard v4.5.1 web-application for WordPress. The
vulnerabilities are located in the `query` and `id` parameters of the
`wpjb-email`, `wpjb-job`, `wpjb-application`, and `wpjb-membership`
modules. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code to
hijack admin session credentials via the backend, or to manipulate the
backend on client-side performed requests. The attack vector is
non-persistent and the request method to inject is GET. The attacker
does not need a privileged user account to perform a successful
exploitation.
