There is a debug-interface vulnerability on some Tenda routers
(FH1202/F1202/F1200: versions before 1.2.0.20). After connecting
locally to a router in a wired or wireless manner, one can bypass
intended access restrictions by sending shell commands directly and
reading their results, or by entering shell commands that change this
router's username and password.
