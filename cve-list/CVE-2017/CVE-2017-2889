An exploitable Denial of Service vulnerability exists in the API
daemon of Circle with Disney running firmware 2.0.1. A large amount of
simultaneous TCP connections causes the APID daemon to repeatedly
fork, causing the daemon to run out of memory and trigger a device
reboot. An attacker needs network connectivity to the device to
trigger this vulnerability.
