PostgreSQL 10.x before 10.1, 9.6.x before 9.6.6, 9.5.x before 9.5.10,
9.4.x before 9.4.15, 9.3.x before 9.3.20, and 9.2.x before 9.2.24 runs
under a non-root operating system account, and database superusers
have effective ability to run arbitrary code under that system
account. PostgreSQL provides a script for starting the database server
during system boot. Packages of PostgreSQL for many operating systems
provide their own, packager-authored startup implementations. Several
implementations use a log file name that the database superuser can
replace with a symbolic link. As root, they open(), chmod() and/or
chown() this log file name. This often suffices for the database
superuser to escalate to root privileges when root starts the server.
