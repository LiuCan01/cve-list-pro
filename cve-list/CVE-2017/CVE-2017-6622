A vulnerability in the web interface for Cisco Prime Collaboration
Provisioning could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass
authentication and perform command injection with root privileges. The
vulnerability is due to missing security constraints in certain HTTP
request methods, which could allow access to files via the web
interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. This vulnerability
affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software Releases prior
to 12.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc98724.
