osTicket 1.10.1 allows arbitrary client-side JavaScript code execution
on victims who click a crafted support/scp/tickets.php?status= link,
aka XSS. Session ID and data theft may follow as well as the
possibility of bypassing CSRF protections, injection of iframes to
establish communication channels, etc. The vulnerability is present
after login into the application. This affects a different tickets.php
file than CVE-2015-1176.
