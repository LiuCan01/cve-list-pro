A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion
clients before 1.8.19, 1.9.x before 1.9.7, and 1.10.0.x through
1.10.0-alpha3 to run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be
generated by a malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a
honest server (to attack another user of that server's repositories),
or by a proxy server. The vulnerability affects all clients, including
those that use file://, http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.
