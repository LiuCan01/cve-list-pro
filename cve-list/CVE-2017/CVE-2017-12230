A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS
XE 16.2 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate their
privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
default permission settings for new users who are created by using the
web UI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by using the web UI of the affected software to create a
new user and then logging into the web UI as the newly created user. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges
on the affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that
are running a vulnerable release Cisco IOS XE Software, if the HTTP
Server feature is enabled for the device. The newly redesigned,
web-based administration UI was introduced in the Denali 16.2 Release
of Cisco IOS XE Software. This vulnerability does not affect the
web-based administration UI in earlier releases of Cisco IOS XE
Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy83062.
