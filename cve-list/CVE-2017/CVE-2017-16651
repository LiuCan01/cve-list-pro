Roundcube Webmail before 1.1.10, 1.2.x before 1.2.7, and 1.3.x before
1.3.3 allows unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the host's
filesystem, including configuration files, as exploited in the wild in
November 2017. The attacker must be able to authenticate at the target
system with a valid username/password as the attack requires an active
session. The issue is related to file-based attachment plugins and
_task=settings&_action=upload-display&_from=timezone requests.
