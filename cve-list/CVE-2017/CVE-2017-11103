Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with
Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a
way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In
_krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from
the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted
version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an
opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks.
NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed
Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part
of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.
