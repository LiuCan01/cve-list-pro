A bug in the standard library ScalarMult implementation of curve P-256
for amd64 architectures in Go before 1.7.6 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2
causes incorrect results to be generated for specific input points. An
adaptive attack can be mounted to progressively extract the scalar
input to ScalarMult by submitting crafted points and observing
failures to the derive correct output. This leads to a full key
recovery attack against static ECDH, as used in popular JWT libraries.
