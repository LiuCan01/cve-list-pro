In Flatpak before 0.8.7, a third-party app repository could include
malicious apps that contain files with inappropriate permissions, for
example setuid or world-writable. The files are deployed with those
permissions, which would let a local attacker run the setuid executable
or write to the world-writable location. In the case of the "system
helper" component, files deployed as part of the app are owned by root,
so in the worst case they could be setuid root.
