** DISPUTED ** boxes.c in nip2 8.4.0 does not validate strings before
launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable,
which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection
attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software maintainer indicates that
this product does not use the BROWSER environment variable.
