A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests in Apache Tomcat
9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18, 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42, 7.0.0 to
7.0.76, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.52, when send file was used, results in the
pipelined request being lost when send file processing of the previous
request completed. This could result in responses appearing to be sent
for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent requests A,
B and C could see the correct response for request A, the response for
request C for request B and no response for request C.
