The OpenBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an
attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that
causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows
attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate
stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This
affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.
