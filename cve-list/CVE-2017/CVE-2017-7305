** DISPUTED ** Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 does not require a
bootloader password, which makes it easier for physically proximate
attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism via a crafted
boot. NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition
of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic
for a bootloader password; however, this password is optional to meet
different customers' needs.
