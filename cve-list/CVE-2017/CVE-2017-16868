Reference: MISC:https://github.com/matthiaskramm/swftools/issues/52

In SWFTools 0.9.2, the wav_convert2mono function in lib/wav.c does not
properly restrict a multiplication within a malloc call, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and
NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted WAV file.
