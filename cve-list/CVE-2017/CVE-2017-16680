Two potential audit log injections in SAP HANA extended application
services 1.0, advanced model: 1) Certain HTTP/REST endpoints of
controller service are missing user input validation which could allow
unprivileged attackers to forge audit log lines. Hence the
interpretation of audit log files could be hindered or misdirected. 2)
User Account and Authentication writes audit logs into syslog and
additionally writes the same audit entries into a log file. Entries in
the log file miss escaping. Hence the interpretation of audit log
files could be hindered or misdirected, while the entries in syslog
are correct.
