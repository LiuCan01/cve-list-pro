A vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration
products based on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized,
elevated access to an affected device. The vulnerability occurs when a
refresh upgrade (RU) or Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) migration
is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade or PCD
migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains
enabled and could allow root access to the device with a known
password. If the vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the
standard upgrade method to an Engineering Special Release, service
update, or a new major release of the affected product, this
vulnerability is remediated by that action. Note: Engineering Special
Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard
upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability. An attacker who
can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable
state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the
attacker to compromise the affected system completely. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvg22923, CSCvg55112, CSCvg55128, CSCvg55145, CSCvg58619, CSCvg64453,
