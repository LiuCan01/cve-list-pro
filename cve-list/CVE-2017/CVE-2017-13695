The acpi_ns_evaluate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nseval.c in the
Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes
a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection
mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.
