The airbag detonation algorithm allows injury to passenger-car
occupants via predictable Security Access (SA) data to the internal CAN
bus (or the OBD connector). This affects the airbag control units (aka
pyrotechnical control units or PCUs) of unspecified passenger vehicles
manufactured in 2014 or later, when the ignition is on and the speed is
less than 6 km/h. Specifically, there are only 256 possible key pairs,
and authentication attempts have no rate limit. In addition, at least
one manufacturer's interpretation of the ISO 26021 standard is that it
must be possible to calculate the key directly (i.e., the other 255 key
pairs must not be used). Exploitation would typically involve an
attacker who has already gained access to the CAN bus, and sends a
crafted Unified Diagnostic Service (UDS) message to detonate the
pyrotechnical charges, resulting in the same passenger-injury risks as
in any airbag deployment.
