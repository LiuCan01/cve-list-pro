A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Secure Access
Control System (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
view sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability
exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect
system software version information when the software responds to HTTP
requests that are sent to the web-based interface of the software. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP
requests to the web-based interface of the affected software. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive
information about the software, which the attacker could use to conduct
additional reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf66155.
