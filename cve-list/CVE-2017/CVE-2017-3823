An issue was discovered in the Cisco WebEx Extension before 1.0.7 on
Google Chrome, the ActiveTouch General Plugin Container before 106 on
Mozilla Firefox, the GpcContainer Class ActiveX control plugin before
10031.6.2017.0126 on Internet Explorer, and the Download Manager
ActiveX control plugin before 2.1.0.10 on Internet Explorer. A
vulnerability in these Cisco WebEx browser extensions could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the affected browser on an affected system. This
vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings
Server and Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training
Center, and Support Center) when they are running on Microsoft Windows.
The vulnerability is a design defect in an application programing
interface (API) response parser within the extension. An attacker that
can convince an affected user to visit an attacker-controlled web page
or follow an attacker-supplied link with an affected browser could
exploit the vulnerability. If successful, the attacker could execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser.
