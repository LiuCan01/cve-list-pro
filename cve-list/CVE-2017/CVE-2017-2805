An exploitable stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the
web management interface used by the Foscam C1 Indoor HD Camera. A
specially crafted http request can cause a stack-based buffer overflow
resulting in overwriting arbitrary data on the stack frame. An
attacker can simply send an http request to the device to trigger this
vulnerability.
