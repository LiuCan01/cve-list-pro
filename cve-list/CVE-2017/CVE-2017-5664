The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires
that, when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the
error that occurred, the original request and response are forwarded
to the error page. This means that the request is presented to the
error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a
static file, expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if
processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method. The
Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to
8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this.
Depending on the original request this could lead to unexpected and
undesirable results for static error pages including, if the
DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or
removal of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided error
pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP
method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any
error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method. (2)
By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the
HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they
handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual
method.
