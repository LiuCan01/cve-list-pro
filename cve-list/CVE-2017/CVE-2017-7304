The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read (of size 8)
because of missing a check (in the copy_special_section_fields
function) for an invalid sh_link field before attempting to follow it.
This vulnerability causes Binutils utilities like strip to crash.
