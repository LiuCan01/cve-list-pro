SYN Flood or FIN Flood attack in ECos 1 and other versions embedded
devices results in web Authentication Bypass. "eCos Embedded Web
Servers used by Multiple Routers and Home devices, while sending SYN
Flood or FIN Flood packets fails to validate and handle the packets
and does not ask for any sign of authentication resulting in
Authentication Bypass. An attacker can take complete advantage of this
bug and take over the device remotely or locally. The bug has been
successfully tested and reproduced in some versions of SOHO Routers
manufactured by TOTOLINK, GREATEK and others."
