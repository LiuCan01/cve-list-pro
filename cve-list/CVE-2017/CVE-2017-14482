GNU Emacs before 25.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via email with crafted "Content-Type: text/enriched" data containing an
x-display XML element that specifies execution of shell commands,
related to an unsafe text/enriched extension in
lisp/textmodes/enriched.el, and unsafe Gnus support for enriched and
richtext inline MIME objects in lisp/gnus/mm-view.el. In particular, an
Emacs user can be instantly compromised by reading a crafted email
message (or Usenet news article).
