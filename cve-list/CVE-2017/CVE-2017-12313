An untrusted search path (aka DLL Preload) vulnerability in the Cisco
Network Academy Packet Tracer software could allow an authenticated,
local attacker to execute arbitrary code via DLL hijacking if a local
user with administrative privileges executes the installer in the
current working directory where a crafted DLL has been placed by an
attacker. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of
path and file names of a DLL file before it is loaded. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious DLL file and
installing it in a specific system directory. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying
Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM
account. An attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this
vulnerability.
