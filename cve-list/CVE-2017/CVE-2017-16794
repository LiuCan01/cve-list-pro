Phase: Assigned (20171111)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/matthiaskramm/swftools/issues/50

The png_load function in lib/png.c in SWFTools 0.9.2 does not properly
validate a multiplication of width and bits-per-pixel values, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
over-read and application crash) via a crafted file, as demonstrated by
an erroneous png_load call that occurs because of incorrect integer
data types in png2swf.
