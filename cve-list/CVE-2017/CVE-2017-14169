In the mxf_read_primer_pack function in libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg
3.3.3, an integer signedness error might occur when a crafted file,
which claims a large "item_num" field such as 0xffffffff, is provided.
As a result, the variable "item_num" turns negative, bypassing the
check for a large value.
