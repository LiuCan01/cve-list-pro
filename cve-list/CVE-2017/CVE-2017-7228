An issue (known as XSA-212) was discovered in Xen, with fixes available
for 4.8.x, 4.7.x, 4.6.x, 4.5.x, and 4.4.x. The earlier XSA-29 fix
introduced an insufficient check on XENMEM_exchange input, allowing the
caller to drive hypervisor memory accesses outside of the guest
provided input/output arrays.
