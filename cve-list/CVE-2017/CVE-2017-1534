IBM Security Access Manager Appliance 8.0.0 and 9.0.0 could allow a
remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect
attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site,
a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL
displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear
to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly
sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim.
IBM X-Force ID: 130676.
