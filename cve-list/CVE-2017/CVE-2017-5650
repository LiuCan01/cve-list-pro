In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the
handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close
streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting
for a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more
data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client
could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would
consume all available processing threads.
