A vulnerability in the remote management access control list (ACL)
feature of the Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the remote management ACL.
The vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of the ACL
decision made during the ingress connection request to the remote
management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a connection to the management IP address or domain name of the
targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
bypass the configured remote management ACL. This can occur when the
Remote Management configuration parameter is set to Disabled. This
vulnerability affects Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Routers running a
firmware image prior to 1.0.1.24. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc14457.
