In SolarWinds Log & Event Manager (LEM) before 6.3.1 Hotfix 4, a menu
system is encountered when the SSH service is accessed with "cmc" and
"password" (the default username and password). By exploiting a
vulnerability in the restrictssh feature of the menuing script, an
attacker can escape from the restricted shell.
