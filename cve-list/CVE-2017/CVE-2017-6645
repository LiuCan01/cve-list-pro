A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Remote Expert Manager
Software 11.0.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
access sensitive Virtual Temporary Directory information on an affected
system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not
sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to HTTP requests
that are sent to the web interface of the software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web
interface of the software on an affected system. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to access sensitive information about the
software. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional
reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc52861.
