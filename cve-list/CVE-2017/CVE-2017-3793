A vulnerability in the TCP normalizer of Cisco Adaptive Security
Appliance (ASA) Software (8.0 through 8.7 and 9.0 through 9.6) and
Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause Cisco ASA and FTD to drop any
further incoming traffic on all interfaces, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper
limitation of the global out-of-order TCP queue for specific block
sizes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large
number of unique permitted TCP connections with out-of-order segments.
An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available blocks in the
global out-of-order TCP queue, causing the dropping of any further
incoming traffic on all interfaces and resulting in a DoS condition.
