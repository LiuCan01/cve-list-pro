Missing anchor in generated regex for rack-cors before 0.4.1 allows a
malicious third-party site to perform CORS requests. If the
configuration were intended to allow only the trusted example.com
domain name and not the malicious example.net domain name, then
example.com.example.net (as well as example.com-example.net) would be
inadvertently allowed.
