A door-unlocking issue was discovered on Software House iStar Ultra
devices through 6.5.2.20569 when used in conjunction with the IP-ACM
Ethernet Door Module. The communications between the IP-ACM and the
iStar Ultra is encrypted using a fixed AES key and IV. Each message is
encrypted in CBC mode and restarts with the fixed IV, leading to replay
attacks of entire messages. There is no authentication of messages
beyond the use of the fixed AES key, so message forgery is also
possible.
