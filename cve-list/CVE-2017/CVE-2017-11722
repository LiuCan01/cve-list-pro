Phase: Assigned (20170728)

Reference: MISC:http://hg.code.sf.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/rev/f423ba88ca4e

The WriteOnePNGImage function in coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
read and application crash) via a crafted file, because the program's
actual control flow was inconsistent with its indentation. This
resulted in a logging statement executing outside of a loop, and
consequently using an invalid array index corresponding to the loop's
exit condition.
