A vulnerability in the gRPC code of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco
Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series Routers could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition when the emsd service stops. The vulnerability is due to the
software's inability to process HTTP/2 packets. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP/2 frame to the
affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
create a DoS condition when the emsd service stops. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvb99388.
