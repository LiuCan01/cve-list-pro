In Odoo 8.0, Odoo Community Edition 9.0 and 10.0, and Odoo Enterprise
Edition 9.0 and 10.0, remote attackers can bypass authentication under
certain circumstances because parameters containing 0x00 characters are
truncated before reaching the database layer. This occurs because
Psycopg 2.x before 2.6.3 is used.
