Phase: Assigned (20170730)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/tinyproxy/tinyproxy/issues/106

main.c in Tinyproxy 1.8.4 and earlier creates a
/run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid file after dropping privileges to a
non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary
processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for
tinyproxy.pid modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat
/run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid`" command.
