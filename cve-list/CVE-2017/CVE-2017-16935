Reference: MISC:https://issues.ametys.org/browse/RUNTIME-2582

Ametys before 4.0.3 requires authentication only for URIs containing a
/cms/ substring, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions via a direct request to
/plugins/core-ui/servercomm/messages.xml, as demonstrated by changing
the admin password by obtaining account details via a users/search.json
request, and then modifying the account via an editUser request.
