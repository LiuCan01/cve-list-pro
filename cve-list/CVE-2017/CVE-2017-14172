In coders/ps.c in ImageMagick 7.0.7-0 Q16, a DoS in ReadPSImage() due
to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption.
When a crafted PSD file, which claims a large "extent" field in the
header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the
loop over "length" would consume huge CPU resources, since there is no
EOF check inside the loop.
