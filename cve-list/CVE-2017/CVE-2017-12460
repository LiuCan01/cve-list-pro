An issue was discovered in Barco ClickShare CSM-1 firmware before
v1.7.0.3 and CSC-1 firmware before v1.10.0.10.  An authenticated user
can manage the wallpaper collection in the webUI to be shown as
background on the ClickShare product.  By uploading a wallpaper with
a specially crafted name, an HTML injection can be triggered as
special characters are not neutralized before output.
