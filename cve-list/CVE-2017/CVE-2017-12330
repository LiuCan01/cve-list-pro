A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow
an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command
arguments to the CLI parser. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by injecting crafted command arguments into a vulnerable
CLI command and gaining unauthorized access to the underlying operating
system of the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary commands at the user's privilege level. On products that
support multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), this vulnerability
could allow an attacker to execute commands at the user's privilege
level outside the user's environment. This vulnerability affects the
following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer
Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000
Series Switches, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform
Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches,
Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000
Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line
Cards and Fabric Modules. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve99902, CSCvf14879.
