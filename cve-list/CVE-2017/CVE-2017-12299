A vulnerability exists in the process of creating default IP blocks
during device initialization for Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall
Services that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send
traffic to the local IP address of the device, bypassing any filters
that are configured to deny local IP management traffic. The
vulnerability is due to an implementation error that exists in the
process of creating default IP blocks when the device is initialized,
and the way in which those IP blocks interact with user-configured
filters for local IP management traffic (for example, SSH to the
device). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
traffic to the local IP address of the targeted device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to connect to the local IP address of
the device even when there are filters configured to deny the traffic.
