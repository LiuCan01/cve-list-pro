When apr_time_exp*() or apr_os_exp_time*() functions are invoked with
an invalid month field value in Apache Portable Runtime APR 1.6.2 and
prior, out of bounds memory may be accessed in converting this value
to an apr_time_exp_t value, potentially revealing the contents of a
different static heap value or resulting in program termination, and
may represent an information disclosure or denial of service
vulnerability to applications which call these APR functions with
unvalidated external input.
