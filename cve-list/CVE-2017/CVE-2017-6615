A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
subsystem of Cisco IOS XE 3.16 could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to a race condition that could occur when the
affected software processes an SNMP read request that contains certain
criteria for a specific object ID (OID) and an active crypto session is
disconnected on an affected device. An attacker who can authenticate to
an affected device could trigger this vulnerability by issuing an SNMP
request for a specific OID on the device. A successful exploit will
cause the device to restart due to an attempt to access an invalid
memory region. The attacker does not control how or when crypto
sessions are disconnected on the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb94392.
