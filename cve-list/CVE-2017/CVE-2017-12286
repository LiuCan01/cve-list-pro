A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Jabber could allow an
authenticated, local attacker to retrieve user profile information from
the affected software, which could lead to the disclosure of
confidential information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input
and validation checks in the affected software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by authenticating locally to an affected
system and then issuing specific commands to the affected software. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to view all profile
information for a user instead of only certain Jabber parameters that
should be visible. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco
Jabber prior to Release 1.9.31. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve52418.
