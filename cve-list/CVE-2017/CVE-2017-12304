A vulnerability in the IOS daemon (IOSd) web-based management interface
of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user
of the web-based management interface on an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input
by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted
link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the web-based management interface or allow
the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvf60862.
