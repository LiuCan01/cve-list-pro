In F5 BIG-IP LTM, AAM, AFM, Analytics, APM, ASM, DNS, GTM, Link
Controller, PEM and Websafe software version 13.0.0, 12.0.0 to 12.1.2
and 11.5.1 to 11.6.1, under limited circumstances connections handled
by a Virtual Server with an associated SOCKS profile may not be
properly cleaned up, potentially leading to resource starvation.
Connections may be left in the connection table which then can only be
removed by restarting TMM. Over time this may lead to the BIG-IP being
unable to process further connections.
