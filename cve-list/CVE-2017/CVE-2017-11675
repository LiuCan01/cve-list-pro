The traverseStrictSanitize function in
admin_dir/includes/classes/AdminRequestSanitizer.php in ZenCart 1.5.5e
mishandles key strings, which allows remote authenticated users to
execute arbitrary PHP code by placing that code into an invalid array
index of the admin_name array parameter to admin_dir/login.php, if
there is an export of an error-log entry for that invalid array index.
