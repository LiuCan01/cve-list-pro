Reference: MISC:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/90

An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. To
encrypt messages, AES in CBC mode is used with a pseudo-random secret.
This secret and the IV are generated with math.random() in previous
versions and with CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random() in newer versions,
which uses math.random() internally. This is not cryptographically
strong.
