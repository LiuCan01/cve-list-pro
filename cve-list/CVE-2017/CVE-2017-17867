Reference: MISC:https://neonsea.uk/blog/2017/12/23/rce-inteno-iopsys.html

Inteno iopsys 2.0-3.14 and 4.0 devices allow remote authenticated users
to execute arbitrary OS commands by modifying the leasetrigger field in
the odhcpd configuration to specify an arbitrary program, as
demonstrated by a program located on an SMB share. This issue existed
because the /etc/uci-defaults directory was not being used to secure
the OpenWrt configuration.
