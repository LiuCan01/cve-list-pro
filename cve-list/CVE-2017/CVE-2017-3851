A Directory Traversal vulnerability in the web framework code of the
Cisco application-hosting framework (CAF) component of the Cisco IOx
application environment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to read any file from the CAF in the virtual instance running on the
affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting
crafted requests to the CAF web interface. The impacts of a successful
exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not
impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx. Cisco IOx Releases 1.0.0.0
and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy52302.
