A vulnerability in the ability for guest users to join meetings via a
hyperlink with Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to enter a meeting with a hyperlink URL, even though
access should be denied. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect
implementation of the configuration setting Guest access via
hyperlinks, which should allow the administrative user to prevent guest
users from using hyperlinks to connect to meetings. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted hyperlink to connect to a
meeting. An exploit could allow the attacker to connect directly to the
meeting with a hyperlink, even though access should be denied. The
attacker would still require a valid hyperlink and encoded secret
identifier to be connected. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve20873.
