VMware Workstation (12.x prior to 12.5.3) and Horizon View Client (4.x
prior to 4.4.0) contain a heap buffer-overflow vulnerability in
TrueType Font (TTF) parser in the TPView.dll. On Workstation, this may
allow a guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the
Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon View
Client, this may allow a View desktop to execute code or perform a
Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client.
Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled.
This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is
enabled by default on Horizon View.
