An issue was discovered in Open-iSCSI through 2.0.875. A local attacker
can cause the iscsiuio server to abort or potentially execute code by
sending messages with incorrect lengths, which (due to lack of
checking) can lead to buffer overflows, and result in aborts (with
overflow checking enabled) or code execution. The
process_iscsid_broadcast function in iscsiuio/src/unix/iscsid_ipc.c
does not validate the payload length before a write operation.
