An exploitable vulnerability exists in the WiFi management of Circle
with Disney. A crafted Access Point with the same name as the
legitimate one can be used to make Circle connect to an untrusted
network. An attacker needs to setup an Access Point reachable by the
device and to send a series of spoofed "deauth" packets to trigger
this vulnerability.
