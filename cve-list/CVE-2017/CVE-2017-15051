Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in TeamPass
before 2.1.27.9 allow authenticated remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) URL value of an item or (2)
user log history. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be
first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker
has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item.
For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within
its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From
there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.
