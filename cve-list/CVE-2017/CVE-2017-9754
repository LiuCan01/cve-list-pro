The process_otr function in bfd/versados.c in the Binary File
Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
2.28, does not validate a certain offset, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as
demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
