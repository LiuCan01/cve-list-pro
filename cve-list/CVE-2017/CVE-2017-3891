In BlackBerry QNX Software Development Platform (SDP) 6.6.0, an
elevation of privilege vulnerability in the default configuration of
the QNX SDP with QNet enabled on networks comprising two or more QNet
nodes could allow an attacker to access local and remote files or take
ownership of files on other QNX nodes regardless of permissions by
executing commands targeting arbitrary nodes from a secondary QNX
6.6.0 QNet node.
