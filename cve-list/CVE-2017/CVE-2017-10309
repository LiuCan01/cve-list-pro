Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE
(subcomponent: Deployment). Supported versions that are affected are
Java SE: 8u144 and 9. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows
unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from
a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in
Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data as
well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible
data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service
(partial DOS) of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java
deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted
code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java
sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
(e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.1
(Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).
