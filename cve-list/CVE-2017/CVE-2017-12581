GitHub Electron before 1.6.8 allows remote command execution because of
a nodeIntegration bypass vulnerability. This also affects all
applications that bundle Electron code equivalent to 1.6.8 or earlier.
Bypassing the Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a precondition; however,
recent Electron versions do not have strict SOP enforcement. Combining
an SOP bypass with a privileged URL internally used by Electron, it was
possible to execute native Node.js primitives in order to run OS
commands on the user's host. Specifically, a
chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html window could be used
to eval a Node.js child_process.execFile API call.
