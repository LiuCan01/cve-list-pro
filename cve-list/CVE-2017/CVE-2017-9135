An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.4 and Mimosa
Backhaul Radios before 2.2.4. On the backend of the device's web
interface, there are some diagnostic tests available that are not
displayed on the webpage; these are only accessible by crafting a POST
request with a program like cURL. There is one test accessible via cURL
that does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to
execute shell commands as the root user.
