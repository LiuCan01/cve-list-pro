The Comcast firmware on Motorola MX011ANM (firmware version
MX011AN_2.9p6s1_PROD_sey) and Xfinity XR11-20 Voice Remote devices
allows local users to upload arbitrary firmware images to an XR11 by
leveraging root access. In other words, there is no protection
mechanism involving digital signatures for the firmware.
