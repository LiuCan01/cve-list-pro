A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management
Controller (IMC) 3.0(1c) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerability
exists because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize
specific values that are received as part of a user-supplied HTTP
request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14578.
