ZoneMinder v1.30 and v1.29, an open-source CCTV server web application,
is vulnerable to CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) which allows a
remote attack to make changes to the web application as the current
logged in victim. If the victim visits a malicious web page, the
attacker can silently and automatically create a new admin user within
the web application for remote persistence and further attacks. The URL
is /zm/index.php and sample parameters could include action=user uid=0
newUser[Username]=attacker1 newUser[Password]=Password1234
conf_password=Password1234 newUser[System]=Edit (among others).
