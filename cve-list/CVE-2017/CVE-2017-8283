dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU
patch program and does not offer a protection mechanism for
blank-indented diff hunks, which allows remote attackers to conduct
directory traversal attacks via a crafted Debian source package, as
demonstrated by use of dpkg-source on NetBSD.
