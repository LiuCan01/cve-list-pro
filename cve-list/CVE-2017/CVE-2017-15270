The PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729 server does not properly escape data
before writing it into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. This can
be used by attackers to hide data in the Graphical User Interface
(GUI) view and create arbitrary entries to a certain extent. Special
characters such as '"' and ',' and 'r' are not escaped and can be
used to add new entries to the log.
