Reference: MISC:https://becomepentester.blogspot.com/2017/10/osTicket-File-Upload-Restrictions-Bypassed-CVE-2017-15580.html

osTicket 1.10.1 provides a functionality to upload 'html' files with
associated formats. However, it does not properly validate the uploaded
file's contents and thus accepts any type of file, such as with a
tickets.php request that is modified with a .html extension changed to
a .exe extension. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to upload
arbitrary files on the web application having malicious content.
