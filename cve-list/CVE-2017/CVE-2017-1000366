glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted
LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to
alias, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note
that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent
manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not
directly exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This
affects glibc 2.25 and earlier.
