A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality
of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or
execute arbitrary code with root privileges on an affected system. The
vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication and authorization
mechanisms for a debugging tool that was inadvertently enabled in the
affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
remotely connecting to the debugging tool via TCP. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to access sensitive information about the
affected software or execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the
affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Data Center
Network Manager (DCNM) Software Releases 10.1(1) and 10.1(2) for
Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Virtual Appliance platforms. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvd09961.
