When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs
enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the
Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server
via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and
any code it contained would be executed by the server.
