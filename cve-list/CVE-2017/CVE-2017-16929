The remote management interface on the Claymore Dual GPU miner 10.1 is
vulnerable to an authenticated directory traversal vulnerability
exploited by issuing a specially crafted request, allowing a remote
attacker to read/write arbitrary files. This can be exploited via ../
sequences in the pathname to miner_file or miner_getfile.
