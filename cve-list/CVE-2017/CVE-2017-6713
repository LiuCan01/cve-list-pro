A vulnerability in the Play Framework of Cisco Elastic Services
Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
gain full access to the affected system. The vulnerability is due to
static, default credentials for the Cisco ESC UI that are shared
between installations. An attacker who can extract the static
credentials from an existing installation of Cisco ESC could generate
an admin session token that allows access to all instances of the ESC
web UI. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller
prior to releases 2.3.1.434 and 2.3.2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76627.
