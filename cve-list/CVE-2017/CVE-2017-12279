A vulnerability in the packet processing code of Cisco IOS Software for
Cisco Aironet Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
attacker to retrieve content from memory on an affected device, which
could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks that are
performed by the affected device when the device adds padding to egress
packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted IP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to retrieve content from memory on the affected
device, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.
