A vulnerability in how DLL files are loaded with Cisco AnyConnect
Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to install and run an executable file with privileges
equivalent to the Microsoft Windows SYSTEM account. The vulnerability
is due to incomplete input validation of path and file names of a DLL
file before it is loaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by creating a malicious DLL file and installing it in a specific system
directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges
equivalent to the SYSTEM account. The attacker would need valid user
credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects
all Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows software
versions prior to 4.4.02034. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc97928.
