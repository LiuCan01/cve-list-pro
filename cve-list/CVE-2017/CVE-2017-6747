A vulnerability in the authentication module of Cisco Identity Services
Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass
local authentication. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of
authentication requests and policy assignment for externally
authenticated users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
authenticating with a valid external user account that matches an
internal username and incorrectly receiving the authorization policy of
the internal account. An exploit could allow the attacker to have Super
Admin privileges for the ISE Admin portal. This vulnerability does not
affect endpoints authenticating to the ISE. The vulnerability affects
Cisco ISE, Cisco ISE Express, and Cisco ISE Virtual Appliance running
Release 1.3, 1.4, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, or 2.1.0. Release 2.2.x is not
affected. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb10995.
