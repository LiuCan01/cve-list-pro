elf.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as
distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, does not validate sizes of core
notes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(bfd_getl32 heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a
crafted object file, related to elfcore_grok_netbsd_procinfo,
elfcore_grok_openbsd_procinfo, and elfcore_grok_nto_status.
