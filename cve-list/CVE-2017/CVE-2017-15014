OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content
Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows
authenticated users to download arbitrary content files regardless of
the attacker's repository permissions: When an authenticated user
uploads content to the repository, he performs the following steps: (1)
calls the START_PUSH RPC-command; (2) uploads the file to the content
server; (3) calls the END_PUSH_V2 RPC-command (here, Content Server
returns a DATA_TICKET integer, intended to identify the location of the
uploaded file on the Content Server filesystem); (4) creates a
dmr_content object in the repository, which has a value of data_ticket
equal to the value of DATA_TICKET returned at the end of END_PUSH_V2
call. As the result of this design, any authenticated user may create
his own dmr_content object, pointing to already existing content in the
Content Server filesystem.
