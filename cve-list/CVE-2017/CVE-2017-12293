A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient limitations on the
number of connections that can be made to the affected software. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening multiple
connections to the server and exhausting server resources. A successful
exploit could cause the server to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
