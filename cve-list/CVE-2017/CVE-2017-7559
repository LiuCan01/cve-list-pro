In Undertow 2.x before 2.0.0.Alpha2, 1.4.x before 1.4.17.Final, and
1.3.x before 1.3.31.Final, it was found that the fix for CVE-2017-2666
was incomplete and invalid characters are still allowed in the query
string and path parameters. This could be exploited, in conjunction
with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a
different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By
manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache,
perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests
other than their own.
