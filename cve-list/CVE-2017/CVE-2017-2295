Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire
(from the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified
format. This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe
manner, which would lead to remote code execution. This change
constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded
YAML.
