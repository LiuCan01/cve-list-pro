The usb_destroy_configuration function in drivers/usb/core/config.c in
the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.14.5 does not
consider the maximum number of configurations and interfaces before
attempting to release resources, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (out-of-bounds write access) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.
