An exploitable free of a stack pointer vulnerability exists in the
x509 certificate parsing code of ARM mbed TLS before 1.3.19, 2.x
before 2.1.7, and 2.4.x before 2.4.2. A specially crafted x509
certificate, when parsed by mbed TLS library, can cause an invalid
free of a stack pointer leading to a potential remote code execution.
In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can act as either
a client or a server on a network to deliver malicious x509
certificates to vulnerable applications.
