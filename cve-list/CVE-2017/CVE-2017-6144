In F5 BIG-IP PEM 12.1.0 through 12.1.2 when downloading the Type
Allocation Code (TAC) database file via HTTPS, the server's
certificate is not verified. Attackers in a privileged network
position may be able to launch a man-in-the-middle attack against
these connections. TAC databases are used in BIG-IP PEM for Device
Type and OS (DTOS) and Tethering detection. Customers not using BIG-IP
PEM, not configuring downloads of TAC database files, or not using
HTTP for that download are not affected.
