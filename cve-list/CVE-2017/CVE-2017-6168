On BIG-IP versions 11.6.0-11.6.2 (fixed in 11.6.2 HF1), 12.0.0-12.1.2
HF1 (fixed in 12.1.2 HF2), or 13.0.0-13.0.0 HF2 (fixed in 13.0.0 HF3)
a virtual server configured with a Client SSL profile may be
vulnerable to an Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher
attack) against RSA, which when exploited, may result in plaintext
recovery of encrypted messages and/or a Man-in-the-middle (MiTM)
attack, despite the attacker not having gained access to the server's
private key itself, aka a ROBOT attack.
