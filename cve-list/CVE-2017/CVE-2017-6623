A vulnerability in a script file that is installed as part of the Cisco
Policy Suite (CPS) Software distribution for the CPS appliance could
allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate their privilege
level to root. The vulnerability is due to incorrect sudoers
permissions on the script file. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by authenticating to the device and providing crafted
user input at the CLI, using this script file to escalate their
privilege level and execute commands as root. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to acquire root-level privileges and take full
control of the appliance. The user has to be logged-in to the device
with valid credentials for a specific set of users. The Cisco Policy
Suite application is vulnerable when running software versions 10.0.0,
10.1.0, or 11.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc07366.
