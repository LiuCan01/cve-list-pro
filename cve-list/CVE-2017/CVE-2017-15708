Reference: MLIST:[dev] 20171210 [CVE-2017-15708] Apache Synapse Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/77f2accf240d25d91b47033e2f8ebec84ffbc6e6627112b2f98b66c9@%3Cdev.synapse.apache.org%3E

In Apache Synapse, by default no authentication is required for Java
Remote Method Invocation (RMI). So Apache Synapse 3.0.1 or all
previous releases (3.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.0, 1.2, 1.1.2, 1.1.1) allows
remote code execution attacks that can be performed by injecting
specially crafted serialized objects. And the presence of Apache
Commons Collections 3.2.1 (commons-collections-3.2.1.jar) or previous
versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable. To mitigate
the issue, we need to limit RMI access to trusted users only. Further
upgrading to 3.0.1 version will eliminate the risk of having said
Commons Collection version. In Synapse 3.0.1, Commons Collection has
been updated to 3.2.2 version.
