It was possible for double OGNL evaluation in FreeMarker templates
through Struts FreeMarker tags to occur. An attacker who has
restricted administration rights to Bamboo or who hosts a website that
a Bamboo administrator visits, is able to exploit this vulnerability
to execute Java code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable
version of Bamboo. All versions of Bamboo before 6.1.6 (the fixed
version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for
6.2.x) are affected by this vulnerability.
