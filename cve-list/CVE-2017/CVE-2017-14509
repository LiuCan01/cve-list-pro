An issue was discovered in SugarCRM before 7.7.2.3, 7.8.x before
7.8.2.2, and 7.9.x before 7.9.2.0 (and Sugar Community Edition 6.5.26).
A remote file inclusion has been identified in the Connectors module
allowing authenticated users to include remotely accessible system
files via a module=CallRest&url= query string. Proper input validation
has been added to mitigate this issue.
