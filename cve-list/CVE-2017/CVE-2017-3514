(subcomponent: AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
6u141, 7u131 and 8u121. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows
unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to

sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code
installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3
