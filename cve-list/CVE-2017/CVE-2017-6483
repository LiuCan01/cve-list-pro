Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in ATutor
2.2.2. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data passed to several pages (lang_code in
themes/*/admin/system_preferences/language_edit.tmpl.php). An attacker
could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the
context of the vulnerable website.
