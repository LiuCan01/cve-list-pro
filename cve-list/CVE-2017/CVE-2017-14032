ARM mbed TLS before 1.3.21 and 2.x before 2.1.9, if optional
authentication is configured, allows remote attackers to bypass peer
authentication via an X.509 certificate chain with many intermediates.
NOTE: although mbed TLS was formerly known as PolarSSL, the releases
shipped with the PolarSSL name are not affected.
