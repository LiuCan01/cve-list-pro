A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Decryption and
Inspection feature of Cisco Firepower System Software 5.4.0, 5.4.1,
6.0.0, 6.1.0, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, and 6.2.2 could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to bypass the SSL policy for decrypting and inspecting
traffic on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to unexpected
interaction with Known Key and Decrypt and Resign configuration
settings of SSL policies when the affected software receives unexpected
SSL packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a crafted SSL packet through an affected device in a valid SSL
session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the
SSL decryption and inspection policy for the affected system, which
could allow traffic to flow through the system without being inspected.
