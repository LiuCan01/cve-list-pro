Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process
memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or
if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This
affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27.
The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when
attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus
secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many
factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be
blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
