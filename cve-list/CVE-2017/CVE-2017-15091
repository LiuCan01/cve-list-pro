An issue has been found in the API component of PowerDNS Authoritative
4.x up to and including 4.0.4 and 3.x up to and including 3.4.11,
where some operations that have an impact on the state of the server
are still allowed even though the API has been configured as read-only
via the api-readonly keyword. This missing check allows an attacker
with valid API credentials to flush the cache, trigger a zone transfer
or send a NOTIFY.
