The _bfd_elf_parse_gnu_properties function in elf-properties.c in the
Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
GNU Binutils 2.29.1, does not prevent negative pointers, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted ELF file.
