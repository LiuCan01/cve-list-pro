The Juniper Enhanced jdhcpd daemon may experience high CPU
utilization, or crash and restart upon receipt of an invalid IPv6 UDP

daemon can result in a denial of service as DHCP service is
interrupted. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are
affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos
