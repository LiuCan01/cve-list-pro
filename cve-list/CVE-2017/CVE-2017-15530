Prior to 4.4.1.10, the Norton Family Android App can be susceptible to
an Information Disclosure issue. Information disclosure is a very
common issue that attackers will attempt to exploit as a first pass
across the application. As they probe the application they will take
note of anything that may seem out of place or any bit of information
they can use to their advantage such as error messages, system
information, user data, version numbers, component names, URL paths,
or even simple typos and misspellings.
