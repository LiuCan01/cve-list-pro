Webmin before 1.860 has XSS with resultant remote code execution. Under
the 'Others/File Manager' menu, there is a 'Download from remote URL'
option to download a file from a remote server. After setting up a
malicious server, one can wait for a file download request and then
send an XSS payload that will lead to Remote Code Execution, as
demonstrated by an OS command in the value attribute of a name='cmd'
input element.
