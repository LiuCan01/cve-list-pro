The implementation of the OSPF protocol in VMware NSX-V Edge 6.2.x
prior to 6.2.8 and NSX-V Edge 6.3.x prior to 6.3.3 doesn't correctly
handle the link-state advertisement (LSA). A rogue LSA may exploit
this issue resulting in continuous sending of LSAs between two routers
eventually going in loop or loss of connectivity.
