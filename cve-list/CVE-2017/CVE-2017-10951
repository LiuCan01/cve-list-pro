This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.0.14878. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within app.launchURL method. The issue results
from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before
