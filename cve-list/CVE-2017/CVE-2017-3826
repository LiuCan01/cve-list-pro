A vulnerability in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
decoder of the Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliance (NGA) with software
before 1.1(1a) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
the device to hang or unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service
(DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of
SCTP packets being monitored on the NGA data ports. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SCTP packets on a
network that is monitored by an NGA data port. SCTP packets addressed
to the IP address of the NGA itself will not trigger this
vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
appliance to become unresponsive or reload, causing a DoS condition.
User interaction could be needed to recover the device using the reboot
command from the CLI. The following Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliances
are vulnerable: NGA 3140, NGA 3240, NGA 3340. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc83320.
