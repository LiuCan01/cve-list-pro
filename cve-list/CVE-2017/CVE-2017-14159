slapd in OpenLDAP 2.4.45 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping
privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill
arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for
PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat
/pathname`" command, as demonstrated by openldap-initscript.
