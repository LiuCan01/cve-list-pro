A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module
of Cisco IOS 15.0 through 15.6 and Cisco IOS XE 3.5 through 16.5 could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU
utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of an affected device that
leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due
to how an affected device processes certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IKEv2 packets to
an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a
reload of the affected device that leads to a DoS condition. This
vulnerability affects Cisco devices that have the Internet Security
Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled. Although only
IKEv2 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that
are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable
when ISAKMP is enabled. A device does not need to be configured with
any IKEv2-specific features to be vulnerable. Many features use IKEv2,
including different types of VPNs such as the following: LAN-to-LAN
VPN; Remote-access VPN, excluding SSL VPN; Dynamic Multipoint VPN
(DMVPN); and FlexVPN. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc41277.
