A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2
20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in
valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition
into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned
strlen(buf). If the content->type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then
(i) the content->prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits)
whereupon (ii) content->name is written to the buffer. However, the
check for whether the content->name actually fits also uses 'len'
rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to
write about "size" many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This
vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.
