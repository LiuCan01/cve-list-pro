The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK
responses. When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2,
the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but
doesn't check that the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code
then tries to read the chunk in pieces of 8192 bytes by using the
MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length to
retr.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bits
of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely
attacker controlled length argument. The attacker can corrupt malloc
metadata after the allocated buffer.
