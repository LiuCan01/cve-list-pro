A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Small Business Managed
Switches software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of
the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient input validation of parameters that are passed to the web
server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by
intercepting and injecting code into a user request. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in
the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to
access sensitive browser-based information. This vulnerability affects
the following Cisco Small Business 300 and 500 Series Managed Switches:
Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches, Cisco Small Business
500 Series Stackable Managed Switches, Cisco 350 Series Managed
Switches, Cisco 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches, Cisco 550X
Series Stackable Managed Switches, Cisco ESW2 Series Advanced Switches.
