** DISPUTED ** SQL injection vulnerability in the 'where' method in
Ruby on Rails 5.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the 'id' parameter. NOTE: The vendor
disputes this issue because the documentation states that this method
is not intended for use with untrusted input.
