The baseband modules of Mate 10, Mate 10 Pro, Mate 9, Mate 9 Pro
Huawei smart phones with software before ALP-AL00 8.0.0.120(SP2C00),
before BLA-AL00 8.0.0.120(SP2C00), before MHA-AL00B 8.0.0.334(C00),
and before LON-AL00B 8.0.0.334(C00) have a stack overflow
vulnerability due to the lack of parameter validation. An attacker
could send malicious packets to the smart phones within radio range by
special wireless device, which leads stack overflow when the baseband
module handles these packets. The attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to perform a denial of service attack or remote code
execution in baseband module.
