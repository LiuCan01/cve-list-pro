An issue was discovered in eClinicalWorks Patient Portal 7.0 build 13.
This is a blind SQL injection within the template.jsp, which can be
exploited without the need of authentication and via an HTTP POST
request, and which can be used to dump database data out to a malicious
server, using an out-of-band technique such as select_loadfile().
