Packetbeat versions prior to 5.6.4 are affected by a denial of service
flaw in the PostgreSQL protocol handler. If Packetbeat is listening
for PostgreSQL traffic and a user is able to send arbitrary network
traffic to the monitored port, the attacker could prevent Packetbeat
from properly logging other PostgreSQL traffic.
