** DISPUTED ** This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC Data Protection
Advisor 6.3.0. Authentication is required to exploit this
vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the EMC DPA Application
service, which listens on TCP port 9002 by default. When parsing the
preScript parameter, the process does not properly validate a
user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An
attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
under the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-4697. NOTE: Dell EMC disputes
that this is a vulnerability.
