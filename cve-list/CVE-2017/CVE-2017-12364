A SQL Injection vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime
Service Catalog could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
execute unauthorized Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. The
vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input that
is used in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a crafted SQL statement to an affected system. Successful
exploitation could allow the attacker to read entries in some database
tables. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg30333.
