Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/jtdowney/private_address_check/issues/1

The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.4.0 is vulnerable to a
bypass due to use of Ruby's Resolv.getaddresses method, which is
OS-dependent and should not be relied upon for security measures, such
as when used to blacklist private network addresses to prevent
server-side request forgery.
