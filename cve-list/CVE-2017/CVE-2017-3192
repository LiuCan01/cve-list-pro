D-Link DIR-130 firmware version 1.23 and DIR-330 firmware version 1.12
do not sufficiently protect administrator credentials. The
tools_admin.asp page discloses the administrator password in base64
encoding in the returned web page. A remote attacker with access to
this page (potentially through a authentication bypass such as
CVE-2017-3191) may obtain administrator credentials for the device.
