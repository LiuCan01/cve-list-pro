A vulnerability in conditional, verbose debug logging for the IPsec
feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to display sensitive IPsec information in the system log file.
The vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of IPsec
conditional, verbose debug logging that causes sensitive information to
be written to the log file. This information should be restricted. An
attacker who has valid administrative credentials could exploit this
vulnerability by authenticating to the device and enabling conditional,
verbose debug logging for IPsec and viewing the log file. An exploit
could allow the attacker to access sensitive information related to the
IPsec configuration. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf12081.
