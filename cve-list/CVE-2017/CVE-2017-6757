A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager
10.5(2.10000.5), 11.0(1.10000.10), and 11.5(1.10000.6) could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a blind SQL injection attack.
The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input
used in SQL queries that bypass protection filters. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that include SQL
statements. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete
entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of the data.
