A vulnerability in Cisco Umbrella Insights Virtual Appliances 2.1.0 and
earlier could allow an authenticated, local attacker to log in to an
affected virtual appliance with root privileges. The vulnerability is
due to the presence of default, static user credentials for an affected
virtual appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
using the hypervisor console to connect locally to an affected system
and then using the static credentials to log in to an affected virtual
appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to
the affected appliance with root privileges. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg31220.
