net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.1 does not properly
restrict association peel-off operations during certain wait states,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid unlock
and double free) via a multithreaded application.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5986.
