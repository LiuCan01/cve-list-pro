The offset2lib patch as used in the Linux Kernel contains a
vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of
arguments or environmental strings then the stack occupies the address
0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above 0x40000000 nullifying
the protection of the offset2lib patch. This affects Linux Kernel
version 4.11.5 and earlier. This is a different issue than
CVE-2017-1000371. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based
systems.
