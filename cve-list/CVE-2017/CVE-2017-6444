Reference: MISC:https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/141449/Mikrotik-Hap-Lite-6.25-Denial-Of-Service.html

The MikroTik Router hAP Lite 6.25 has no protection mechanism for
unsolicited TCP ACK packets in the case of a fast network connection,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption) by sending many ACK packets. After the attacker stops the
exploit, the CPU usage is 100% and the router requires a reboot for
normal operation.
