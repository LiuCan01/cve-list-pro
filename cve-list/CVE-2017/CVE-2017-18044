A Command Injection issue was discovered in
ContentStore/Base/CVDataPipe.dll in Commvault before v11 SP6. A certain
message parsing function inside the Commvault service does not properly
validate the input of an incoming string before passing it to
CreateProcess. As a result, a specially crafted message can inject
commands that will be executed on the target operating system.
Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require authentication and
can lead to SYSTEM level privilege on any system running the cvd
daemon. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-3195.
