A vulnerability in the malware detection functionality within Advanced
Malware Protection (AMP) of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email
Security Appliances (ESAs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause an email attachment containing malware to be
delivered to the end user. The vulnerability is due to the failure of
AMP to scan certain EML attachments that could contain malware. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a
crafted EML attachment through the targeted device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured ESA email
message and content filtering and allow the malware to be delivered to
the end user. Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability affects Cisco
AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA, both virtual and hardware appliances,
that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming
email attachments on the ESA. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz81533.
