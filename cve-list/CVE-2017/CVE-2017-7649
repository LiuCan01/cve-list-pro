The network enabled distribution of Kura before 2.1.0 takes control
over the device's firewall setup but does not allow IPv6 firewall
rules to be configured. Still the Equinox console port 5002 is left
open, allowing to log into Kura without any user credentials over
unencrypted telnet and executing commands using the Equinox "exec"
command. As the process is running as "root" full control over the
device can be acquired. IPv6 is also left in auto-configuration mode,
accepting router advertisements automatically and assigns a MAC
address based IPv6 address.
