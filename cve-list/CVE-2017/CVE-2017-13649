UnrealIRCd 4.0.13 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping
privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill
arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for
PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat
/pathname`" command. NOTE: the vendor indicates that there is no common
or recommended scenario in which a root script would execute this kill
command.
