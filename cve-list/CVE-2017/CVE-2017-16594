This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files
on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager
7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit
this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be
bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.db.save_005fimage_jsp servlet, which listens on
TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the id parameter, the process
does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can allow for the
upload of files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
execute code under the context of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5117.
