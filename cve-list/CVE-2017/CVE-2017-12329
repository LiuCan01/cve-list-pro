A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating
System (FXOS) and NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated,
local attacker to perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments to the CLI
parser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting
crafted command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. An exploit
could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands at the user's
privilege level. On products that support multiple virtual device
contexts (VDCs), this vulnerability could allow the attacker to execute
commands at the user's privilege level outside the user's environment.
This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco FXOS or
NX-OS System Software: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall,
Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus
1000V Series Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000
Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5000 Series
Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches,
Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700
Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode,
Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, Unified Computing
System Manager. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve51700, CSCve93833, CSCve93860,
CSCve93863, CSCve93864, CSCve93880.
