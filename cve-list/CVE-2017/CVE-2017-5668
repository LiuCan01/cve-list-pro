bitlbee-libpurple before 3.5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via a file transfer request for a contact that
is not in the contact list.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10189.
