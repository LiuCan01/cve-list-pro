The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read (of size 4)
because of missing a check (in the find_link function) for null headers
before attempting to match them. This vulnerability causes Binutils
utilities like strip to crash.
