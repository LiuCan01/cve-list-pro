This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the parsing of the yTsiz member of SIZ
markers. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an
allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with
other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current
process. Was ZDI-CAN-4977.
