Certain Technicolor devices have an SNMP access-control bypass,
possibly involving an ISP customization in some cases. The Technicolor
(formerly Cisco) DPC3928SL with firmware
D3928SL-P15-13-A386-c3420r55105-160127a could be reached by any SNMP
community string from the Internet; also, you can write in the MIB
because it provides write properties, aka Stringbleed. NOTE: the
string-bleed/StringBleed-CVE-2017-5135 GitHub repository is not a valid
reference as of 2017-04-27; it contains Trojan horse code purported to
exploit this vulnerability.
