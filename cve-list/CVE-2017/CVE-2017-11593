Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Markdown Preview Plus
extension before 0.5.7 for Chrome allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML into some web applications via the upload
and display of crafted text, markdown, or rst files that are designed
to be viewed in the browser as plain text, but that will be converted
to HTML without proper sanitization.
