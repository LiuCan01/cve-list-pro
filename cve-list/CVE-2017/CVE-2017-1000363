Linux drivers/char/lp.c Out-of-Bounds Write. Due to a missing bounds
check, and the fact that parport_ptr integer is static, a 'secure
boot' kernel command line adversary (can happen due to bootloader
vulns, e.g. Google Nexus 6's CVE-2016-10277, where due to a
vulnerability the adversary has partial control over the command line)
can overflow the parport_nr array in the following code, by appending
many (>LP_NO) 'lp=none' arguments to the command line.
