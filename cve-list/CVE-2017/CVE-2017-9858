** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. By sending crafted packets to an inverter and observing the
response, active and inactive user accounts can be determined. This
aids in further attacks (such as a brute force attack) as one now
knows exactly which users exist and which do not. NOTE: the vendor's
position is that this "is not a security gap per se." Also, only Sunny
Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could
potentially be affected.
