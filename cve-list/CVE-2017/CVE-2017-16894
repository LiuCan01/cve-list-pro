Reference: MISC:http://whiteboyz.xyz/laravel-env-file-vuln.html

In Laravel framework through 5.5.21, remote attackers can obtain
sensitive information (such as externally usable passwords) via a
direct request for the /.env URI. NOTE: this CVE is only about Laravel
framework's writeNewEnvironmentFileWith function in
src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/KeyGenerateCommand.php, which uses
file_put_contents without restricting the .env permissions. The .env
filename is not used exclusively by Laravel framework.
