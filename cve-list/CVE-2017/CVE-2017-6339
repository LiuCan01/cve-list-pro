Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 before
CP 1746 mismanages certain key and certificate data. Per IWSVA
documentation, by default, IWSVA acts as a private Certificate
Authority (CA) and dynamically generates digital certificates that are
sent to client browsers to complete a secure passage for HTTPS
connections. It also allows administrators to upload their own
certificates signed by a root CA. An attacker with low privileges can
download the current CA certificate and Private Key (either the default
ones or ones uploaded by administrators) and use those to decrypt HTTPS
traffic, thus compromising confidentiality. Also, the default Private
Key on this appliance is encrypted with a very weak passphrase. If an
appliance uses the default Certificate and Private Key provided by
Trend Micro, an attacker can simply download these and decrypt the
Private Key using the default/weak passphrase.
