Before Thornberry NDoc version 8.0, laptop clients and the server have
default database (Cache) users set up with a single password. This
password is left behind in a cleartext log file during client
installation on laptops. This password can be used to gain full
admin/system access to client devices (if no firewall is present) or
the NDoc server itself. Once the password is known to an attacker,
local access is not required.
