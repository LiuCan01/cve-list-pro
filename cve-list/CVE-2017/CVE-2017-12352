A vulnerability in certain system script files that are installed at
boot time on Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers could
allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges and
execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected host
operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
of user-controlled input that is supplied to certain script files of an
affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
submitting crafted input to a script file on an affected system. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges
and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected
system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to
authenticate to the affected system by using valid administrator
credentials. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf57274.
