An error was found in the X-Pack Security TLS trust manager for
versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.1. If reloading the trust material fails the
trust manager will be replaced with an instance that trusts all
certificates. This could allow any node using any certificate to join
a cluster. The proper behavior in this instance is for the TLS trust
manager to deny all certificates.
