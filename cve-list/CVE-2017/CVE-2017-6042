A Cross-Site Request Forgery issue was discovered in Sierra Wireless
AirLink Raven XE, all versions prior to 4.0.14, and AirLink Raven XT,
all versions prior to 4.0.11. Affected devices do not verify if a
request was intentionally sent by the logged-in user, which may allow
an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to
the web server that will be treated as an authentic request.
