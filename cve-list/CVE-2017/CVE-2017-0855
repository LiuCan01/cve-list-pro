In MPEG4Extractor.cpp, there are several places where functions return
early without cleaning up internal buffers which could lead to memory
leaks. This could lead to remote denial of service of a critical
system process with no additional execution privileges needed. User
interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android.
