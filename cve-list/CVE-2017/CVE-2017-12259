A vulnerability in the implementation of Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) functionality in Cisco Small Business SPA51x Series IP Phones
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected
device to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
condition. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of SIP
request messages by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending malformed SIP messages to an affected device.
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected
device to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition that
persists until the device is restarted manually. This vulnerability
affects Cisco Small Business SPA51x Series IP Phones that are running
Cisco SPA51x Firmware Release 7.6.2SR1 or earlier. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc63982.
