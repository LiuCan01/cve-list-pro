** DISPUTED ** An Incorrect Password Management issue was discovered
in SMA Solar Technology products. Default passwords exist that are
rarely changed. User passwords will almost always be default.
Installer passwords are expected to be default or similar across
installations installed by the same company (but are sometimes
changed). Hidden user accounts have (at least in some cases, though
more research is required to test this for all hidden user accounts) a
fixed password for all devices; it can never be changed by a user.
Other vulnerabilities exist that allow an attacker to get the
passwords of these hidden user accounts. NOTE: the vendor reports that
it has no influence on the allocation of passwords, and that global
hardcoded master passwords do not exist. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21
and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be
affected.
