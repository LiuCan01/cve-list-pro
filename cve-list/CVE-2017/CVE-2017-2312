On Juniper Networks devices running Junos OS affected versions and
with LDP enabled, a specific LDP packet destined to the RE (Routing
Engine) will consume a small amount of the memory allocated for the
rpd (routing protocol daemon) process. Over time, repeatedly receiving
this type of LDP packet(s) will cause the memory to exhaust and the
rpd process to crash and restart. It is not possible to free up the
memory that has been consumed without restarting the rpd process. This
issue affects Junos OS based devices with either IPv4 or IPv6 LDP
enabled via the [protocols ldp] configuration (the native IPv6 support
for LDP is available in Junos OS 16.1 and higher). The interface on
which the packet arrives needs to have LDP enabled. The affected Junos
versions are: 13.3 prior to 13.3R10; 14.1 prior to 14.1R8; 14.2 prior
to 14.2R7-S6 or 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S14, 15.1F6-S4, 15.1F7,
15.1R4-S7, 15.1R5; 15.1X49 before 15.1X49-D70; 15.1X53 before
15.1X53-D230, 15.1X53-D63, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 before 16.1R2. 16.2R1 and
all subsequent releases have a resolution for this vulnerability.
