A Missing Authentication for Critical Function issue was discovered in
Schneider Electric InduSoft Web Studio v8.0 SP2 or prior, and InTouch
Machine Edition v8.0 SP2 or prior. InduSoft Web Studio provides the
capability for an HMI client to trigger script execution on the server
for the purposes of performing customized calculations or actions. A
remote malicious entity could bypass the server authentication and
trigger the execution of an arbitrary command. The command is executed
under high privileges and could lead to a complete compromise of the
server.
