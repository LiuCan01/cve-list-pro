By exploiting the way Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.4 renders embedded
objects, an attacker could craft a document that allows reading in a
file from the user's filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the
attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information,
tricking the user into saving the document and convincing the user to
send the document back to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated
by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path in the
target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document
and sending it back.
