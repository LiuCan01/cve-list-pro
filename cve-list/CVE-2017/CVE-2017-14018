An improper authentication issue was discovered in Johnson & Johnson
Ethicon Endo-Surgery Generator Gen11, all versions released before
November 29, 2017. The security authentication mechanism used between
the Ethicon Endo-Surgery Generator Gen11 and single-patient use
products can be bypassed, allowing for unauthorized devices to be
connected to the generator, which could result in a loss of integrity
or availability.
