Nextcloud Server before 9.0.55 and 10.0.2 suffers from a bypass in the
quota limitation. Due to not properly sanitizing values provided by
the `OC-Total-Length` HTTP header an authenticated adversary may be
able to exceed their configured user quota. Thus using more space than
allowed by the administrator.
