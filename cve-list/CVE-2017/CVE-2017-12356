A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Jabber
for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input
by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the
interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf50378, CSCvg56018.
