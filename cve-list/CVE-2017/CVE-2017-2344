A routine within an internal Junos OS sockets library is vulnerable to
a buffer overflow. Malicious exploitation of this issue may lead to a
denial of service (kernel panic) or be leveraged as a privilege
escalation through local code execution. The routines are only
accessible via programs running on the device itself, and veriexec
restricts arbitrary programs from running on Junos OS. There are no
known exploit vectors utilizing signed binaries shipped with Junos OS
itself. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior
to 12.1X46-D67; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D51, 12.3X48-D55; 13.3 prior
