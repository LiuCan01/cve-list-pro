A vulnerability in the Cisco Finesse Notification Service for Cisco
Unified Contact Center Enterprise (UCCE) 11.5(1) and 11.6(1) could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve information from
agents using the Finesse Desktop. The vulnerability is due to the
existence of a user account that has an undocumented, hard-coded
password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the
hard-coded credentials to subscribe to the Finesse Notification
Service, which would allow the attacker to receive notifications when
an agent signs in or out of the Finesse Desktop, when information about
an agent changes, or when an agent's state changes. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc08314.
