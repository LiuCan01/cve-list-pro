A specially crafted x509 certificate can cause a single out of bounds
byte overwrite in wolfSSL through 3.10.2 resulting in potential
certificate validation vulnerabilities, denial of service and possible
remote code execution. In order to trigger this vulnerability, the
attacker needs to supply a malicious x509 certificate to either a
server or a client application using this library.
