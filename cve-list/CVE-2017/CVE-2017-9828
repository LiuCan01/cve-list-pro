'/cgi-bin/admin/testserver.cgi' of the web service in most of the
VIVOTEK Network Cameras is vulnerable to shell command injection, which
allows remote attackers to execute any shell command as root via a
crafted HTTP request. This vulnerability is already verified on VIVOTEK
Network Camera IB8369/FD8164/FD816BA; most others have similar firmware
that may be affected. An attack uses shell metacharacters in the
senderemail parameter.
