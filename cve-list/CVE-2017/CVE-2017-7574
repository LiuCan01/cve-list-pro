Schneider Electric SoMachine Basic 1.4 SP1 and Schneider Electric
Modicon TM221CE16R 1.3.3.3 devices have a hardcoded-key vulnerability.
The Project Protection feature is used to prevent unauthorized users
from opening an XML protected project file, by prompting the user for a
password. This XML file is AES-CBC encrypted; however, the key used for
encryption (SoMachineBasicSoMachineBasicSoMa) cannot be changed. After
decrypting the XML file with this key, the user password can be found
in the decrypted data. After reading the user password, the project can
be opened and modified with the Schneider product.
