This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the pageSpan method of XFA Layout objects.
The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can
leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process.
Was ZDI-CAN-5029.
