NixOS 17.03 and earlier has an unintended default absence of SSL
Certificate Validation for LDAP. The users.ldap NixOS module implements
user authentication against LDAP servers via a PAM module. It was found
that if TLS is enabled to connect to the LDAP server with
users.ldap.useTLS, peer verification will be unconditionally disabled
in /etc/ldap.conf.
