It was discovered that an issue in the session logic in Unitrends
Backup (UB) before 10.0.0 allowed using the LOGDIR environment variable
during a web session to elevate an existing low-privilege user to root
privileges. A remote attacker with existing low-privilege credentials
could then execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
