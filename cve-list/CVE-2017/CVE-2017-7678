In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take
advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting
a link that points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data
including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data,
which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user
and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is
not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute
the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.
