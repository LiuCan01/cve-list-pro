The flash-based vSphere Web Client (6.0 prior to 6.0 U3c and 5.5 prior
to 5.5 U3f) i.e. not the new HTML5-based vSphere Client, contains SSRF
and CRLF injection issues due to improper neutralization of URLs. An
attacker may exploit these issues by sending a POST request with
modified headers towards internal services leading to information
disclosure.
