The 'Find Phone' function in Nice smartphones with software versions
earlier before Nice-AL00C00B0135 has an authentication bypass
vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker may wipe and factory reset
the phone by special steps. Due to missing authentication of the 'Find
Phone' function, an attacker may exploit the vulnerability to bypass
the 'Find Phone' function in order to use the phone normally.
