A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) 9.5(1) could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user
of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input
by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the
interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd82064.
