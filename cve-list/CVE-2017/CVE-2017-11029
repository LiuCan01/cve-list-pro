In android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, with all Android
releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, camera application triggers
"user-memory-access" issue as the Camera CPP module Linux driver
directly accesses the application provided buffer, which resides in
user space. An unchecked userspace value (ioctl_ptr->len) is used to
copy contents to a kernel buffer which can lead to kernel buffer
overflow.
