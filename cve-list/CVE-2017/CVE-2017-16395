An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The
vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length
value in the image conversion module when processing Enhanced Metafile
Format (EMF). Crafted EMF input (EMR_STRETCHDIBITS) causes a mismatch
between allocated buffer size and the access allowed by the
computation. If an attacker can adequately control the accessible
memory then this vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary
code execution.
