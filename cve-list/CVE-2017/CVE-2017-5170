An Uncontrolled Search Path Element issue was discovered in Moxa
SoftNVR-IA Live Viewer, Version 3.30.3122 and prior versions. An
uncontrolled search path element (DLL Hijacking) vulnerability has been
identified. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could rename a
malicious DLL to meet the criteria of the application, and the
application would not verify that the DLL is correct. The attacker
needs to have administrative access to the default install location in
order to plant the insecure DLL. Once loaded by the application, the
DLL could run malicious code at the privilege level of the application.
