The lexer_process_char_literal function in
jerry-core/parser/js/js-lexer.c in JerryScript 1.0 does not skip memory
allocation for empty strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via
malformed JavaScript source code, related to the jmem_heap_free_block
function.
