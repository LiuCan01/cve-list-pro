The get_build_id function in opncls.c in the Binary File Descriptor
(BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
over-read and application crash) via a crafted file in which a certain
size field is larger than a corresponding data field, as demonstrated
by mishandling within the objdump program.
