In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the
refactoring of the HTTP connectors introduced a regression in the send
file processing. If the send file processing completed quickly, it was
possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice.
This could result in the same Processor being used for multiple
requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors and/or response
mix-up.
