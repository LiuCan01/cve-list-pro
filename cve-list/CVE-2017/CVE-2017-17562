Embedthis GoAhead before 3.6.5 allows remote code execution if CGI is
enabled and a CGI program is dynamically linked. This is a result of
initializing the environment of forked CGI scripts using untrusted HTTP
request parameters in the cgiHandler function in cgi.c. When combined
with the glibc dynamic linker, this behaviour can be abused for remote
code execution using special parameter names such as LD_PRELOAD. An
attacker can POST their shared object payload in the body of the
request, and reference it using /proc/self/fd/0.
