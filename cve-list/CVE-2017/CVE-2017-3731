If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a
specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that
server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting
in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using
CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2,
the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not
disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.
