A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an
affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the
affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user
request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in
the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to
access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve96608.
