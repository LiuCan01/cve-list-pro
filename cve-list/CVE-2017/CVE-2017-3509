Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle
Java SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are
affected are Java SE: 6u141, 7u131 and 8u121; Java SE Embedded: 8u121.
Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java
SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a
person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this
vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as
unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code
installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.2
(Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
