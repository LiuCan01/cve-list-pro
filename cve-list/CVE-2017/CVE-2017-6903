In ioquake3 before 2017-03-14, the auto-downloading feature has
insufficient content restrictions. This also affects Quake III Arena,
OpenArena, OpenJK, iortcw, and other id Tech 3 (aka Quake 3 engine)
forks. A malicious auto-downloaded file can trigger loading of crafted
auto-downloaded files as native code DLLs. A malicious auto-downloaded
file can contain configuration defaults that override the user's.
Executable bytecode in a malicious auto-downloaded file can set
configuration variables to values that will result in unwanted native
code DLLs being loaded, resulting in sandbox escape.
