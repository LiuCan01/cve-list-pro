An Uncontrolled Search Path or Element issue was discovered in i-SENS
SmartLog Diabetes Management Software, Version 2.4.0 and prior
versions. An uncontrolled search path element vulnerability has been
identified which could be exploited by placing a specially crafted DLL
file in the search path. If the malicious DLL is loaded prior to the
valid DLL, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system. This
vulnerability does not affect the connected blood glucose monitor and
would not impact delivery of therapy to the patient.
