An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made
an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable
page reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with
that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a
grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious
guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most
likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege
escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.
