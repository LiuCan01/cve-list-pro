A vulnerability in the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a HTTP response
splitting attack. The vulnerability is due to the failure of the
application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP
headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into
multiple responses. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform
cross-site scripting attacks, cross-user defacement, web cache
poisoning, and similar exploits. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf16705.
