An issue was discovered in network-manager-applet (aka
network-manager-gnome) in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, and
16.10. A local attacker could use this issue at the default Ubuntu
login screen to access local files and execute arbitrary commands as
the lightdm user. The exploitation requires physical access to the
locked computer and the Wi-Fi must be turned on. An access point that
lets you use a certificate to login is required as well, but it's easy
to create one. Then, it's possible to open a nautilus window and browse
directories. One also can open some applications such as Firefox, which
is useful for downloading malicious binaries.
