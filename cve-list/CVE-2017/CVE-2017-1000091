GitHub Branch Source Plugin connects to a user-specified GitHub API
URL (e.g. GitHub Enterprise) as part of form validation and completion
(e.g. to verify Scan Credentials are correct). This functionality
improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to connect to any web server and send credentials
with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this
functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing
the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via
Cross-Site Request Forgery.
