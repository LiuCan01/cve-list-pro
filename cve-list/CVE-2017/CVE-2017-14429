The DHCP client on D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through
FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02)
devices allows unauthenticated remote code execution as root because
/etc/services/INET/inet_ipv4.php mishandles shell metacharacters,
affecting generated files such as WAN-1-udhcpc.sh.
