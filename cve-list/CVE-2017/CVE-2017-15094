An issue has been found in the DNSSEC parsing code of PowerDNS
Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.6 leading to a memory leak
when parsing specially crafted DNSSEC ECDSA keys. These keys are only
parsed when validation is enabled by setting dnssec to a value other
than off or process-no-validate (default).
