The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c
in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and
causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR
protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI
table.
