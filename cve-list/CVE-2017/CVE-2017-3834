A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet 1830 Series and Cisco Aironet 1850
Series Access Points running Cisco Mobility Express Software could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take complete control of
an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the existence of
default credentials for an affected device that is running Cisco
Mobility Express Software, regardless of whether the device is
configured as a master, subordinate, or standalone access point. An
attacker who has layer 3 connectivity to an affected device could use
Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to the device with elevated privileges. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to take complete control of
the device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Aironet 1830 Series and
Cisco Aironet 1850 Series Access Points that are running an 8.2.x
release of Cisco Mobility Express Software prior to Release 8.2.111.0,
regardless of whether the device is configured as a master,
subordinate, or standalone access point. Release 8.2 was the first
release of Cisco Mobility Express Software for next generation Cisco
Aironet Access Points. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva50691.
