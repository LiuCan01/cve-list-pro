There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication
procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC
algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA
and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform
and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered
just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce
information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount
of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have
to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no
longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors
that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th
generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to
CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version
1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n.
Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release
of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL
1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit
e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.
