A Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in MagniComp's Sysinfo
before 10-H64 for Linux and UNIX platforms could allow a local
attacker to gain elevated privileges. Parts of SysInfo require
setuid-to-root access in order to access restricted system files and
make restricted kernel calls. This access could be exploited by a
local attacker to gain a root shell prompt using the right combination
of environment variables and command line arguments.
