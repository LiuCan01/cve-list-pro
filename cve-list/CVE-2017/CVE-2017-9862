** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. When signed into Sunny Explorer with a wrong password, it is
possible to create a debug report, disclosing information regarding
the application and allowing the attacker to create and save a .txt
file with contents to his liking. An attacker may use this for
information disclosure, or to write a file to normally unavailable
locations on the local system. NOTE: the vendor reports that "the
information contained in the debug report is of marginal
significance." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny
Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
