Phase: Assigned (20180102)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/blendin/pocs/blob/master/opencv/0.OOB_Write_FillUniColor
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/9723

In opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/utils.cpp, functions FillUniColor and
FillUniGray do not check the input length, which can lead to integer
overflow. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code
execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier.
