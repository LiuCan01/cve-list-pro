An issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was
observed in the "decode_ne_resource_id" function in the "restable.c"
source file. This is happening because the "len" parameter for memcpy
is not checked for size and thus becomes a negative integer in the
process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects wrestool.
