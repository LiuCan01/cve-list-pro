An issue was discovered in Unitrends Enterprise Backup before 9.1.1.
The function downloadFile in api/includes/restore.php blindly accepts
any filename passed to /api/restore/download as valid. This allows an
authenticated attacker to read any file in the filesystem that the web
server has access to, aka Local File Inclusion (LFI).
