Name: CVE-2017-8851
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8851
Phase: Assigned (20170508)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017021

An issue was discovered on OnePlus One and X devices. Due to a lenient
updater-script on the OnePlus One and X OTA images, the fact that both
products use the same OTA verification keys, and the fact that both
products share the same 'ro.build.product' system property, attackers
can install OTAs of one product over the other, even on locked
bootloaders. That could theoretically allow for exploitation of
vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition
to expansion of the attack surface. Moreover, the vulnerability may
result in having the device unusable until a Factory Reset is
performed. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle
(MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because
the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In
addition, physical attackers can reboot the phone into recovery, and
then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA.
