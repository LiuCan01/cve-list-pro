Reference: MISC:https://www.twistlock.com/2017/11/20/cve-2017-16544-busybox-autocompletion-vulnerability/

In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox through
1.27.2, the tab autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list
of filenames in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in
executing any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially
result in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.
