A vulnerability in the web framework code for the SQL database
interface of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning application
could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the
confidentiality and integrity of the application by executing arbitrary
SQL queries, aka SQL Injection. The attacker could read or write
information from the SQL database. The vulnerability is due to a lack
of proper validation on user-supplied input within SQL queries. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that
contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application. An
exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain
values and write malicious input in the SQL database. The attacker
would need to have valid user credentials. This vulnerability affects
Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software Releases prior to 12.3.
