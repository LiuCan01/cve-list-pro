An arbitrary file upload vulnerability, present in TeamPass before
2.1.27.9, allows remote authenticated users to upload arbitrary files
leading to Remote Command Execution. To exploit this vulnerability, an
authenticated attacker has to tamper with parameters of a request to
upload.files.php, in order to select the correct branch and be able to
upload any arbitrary file. From there, it can simply access the file to
execute code on the server.
