Reference: MLIST:[announce] 20170707 [SECURITY] CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication in Apache Solr
Reference: URL:http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201707.mbox/%3CCAOOKt53EgrybaD%2BiSn-nBbvFdse-szhg%3DhMoDZuvUvyMme-Z%3Dg%40mail.gmail.com%3E
Reference: BID:99485

Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node
communication when security is enabled. It is possible to create a
specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster
and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster
to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if
Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the
BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication
plugin, which does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin"
or "HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this
attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those
who use Kerberos are not affected.
