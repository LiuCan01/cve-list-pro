An FBX-5312 issue was discovered in WatchGuard Fireware before 12.0. If
a login attempt is made in the XML-RPC interface with an XML message
containing an empty member element, the wgagent crashes, logging out
any user with a session opened in the UI. By continuously executing the
failed login attempts, UI management of the device becomes impossible.
