The GlobalProtect external interface in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
before 6.1.17, 7.x before 7.0.15, 7.1.x before 7.1.9, and 8.x before
8.0.2 provides different error messages for failed login attempts
depending on whether the username exists, which allows remote attackers
to enumerate account names and conduct brute-force attacks via a series
of requests, aka PAN-SA-2017-0014 and PAN-72769.
