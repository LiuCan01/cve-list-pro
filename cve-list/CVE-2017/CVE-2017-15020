dwarf1.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as
distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, mishandles pointers, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, related
to parse_die and parse_line_table, as demonstrated by a parse_die
heap-based buffer over-read.
