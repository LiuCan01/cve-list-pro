Arbitrary code execution due to incomplete sandbox protection:
Constructors, instance variable initializers, and instance
initializers in Pipeline scripts were not subject to sandbox
protection, and could therefore execute arbitrary code. This could be
exploited e.g. by regular Jenkins users with the permission to
configure Pipelines in Jenkins, or by trusted committers to
repositories containing Jenkinsfiles.
