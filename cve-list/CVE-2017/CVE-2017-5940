Firejail before 0.9.44.6 and 0.9.38.x LTS before 0.9.38.10 LTS does not
comprehensively address dotfile cases during its attempt to prevent
accessing user files with an euid of zero, which allows local users to
conduct sandbox-escape attacks via vectors involving a symlink and the
--private option. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5180.
