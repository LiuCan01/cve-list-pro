An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT
packet parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially
crafted MQTT packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read
and write potentially resulting in information disclosure, denial of
service and remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a
specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this
vulnerability.
