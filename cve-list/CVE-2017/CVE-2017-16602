This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager
7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit
this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be
bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.tools.exec_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port
8081 by default. When parsing the command parameter, the process does
not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to
execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
execute code under the context of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5193.
