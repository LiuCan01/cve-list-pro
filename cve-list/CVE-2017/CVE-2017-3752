An industry-wide vulnerability has been identified in the
implementation of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol
used on some Lenovo switches. Exploitation of these implementation
flaws may result in attackers being able to erase or alter the routing
tables of one or many routers, switches, or other devices that support
OSPF within a routing domain.
