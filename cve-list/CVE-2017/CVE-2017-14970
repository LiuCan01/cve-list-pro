In lib/ofp-util.c in Open vSwitch (OvS) before 2.8.1, there are
multiple memory leaks while parsing malformed OpenFlow group mod
messages. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report,
stating "it can only be triggered by an OpenFlow controller, but
OpenFlow controllers have much more direct and powerful ways to force
Open vSwitch to allocate memory, such as by inserting flows into the
flow table."
