Reference: CONFIRM:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22148

The *_get_synthetic_symtab functions in the Binary File Descriptor
(BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29,
interpret a -1 value as a sorting count instead of an error flag, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow
and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted ELF file, related to elf32-i386.c and elf64-x86-64.c.
