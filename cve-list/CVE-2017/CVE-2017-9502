In curl before 7.54.1 on Windows and DOS, libcurl's default protocol
function, which is the logic that allows an application to set which
protocol libcurl should attempt to use when given a URL without a
scheme part, had a flaw that could lead to it overwriting a heap based
memory buffer with seven bytes. If the default protocol is specified to
be FILE or a file: URL lacks two slashes, the given "URL" starts with a
drive letter, and libcurl is built for Windows or DOS, then libcurl
would copy the path 7 bytes off, so that the end of the given path
would write beyond the malloc buffer (7 bytes being the length in bytes
of the ascii string "file://").
