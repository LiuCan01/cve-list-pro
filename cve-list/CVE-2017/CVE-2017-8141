The Touch Panel (TP) driver in P10 Plus smart phones with software
versions earlier than VKY-AL00C00B153 has a memory double free
vulnerability. An attacker with the root privilege of the Android
system tricks a user into installing a malicious application, and the
application can start multiple threads and try to free specific
memory, which could triggers double free and causes a system crash or
arbitrary code execution.
