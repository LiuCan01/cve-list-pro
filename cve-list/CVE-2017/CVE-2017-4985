In EMC VNX2 versions prior to OE for File 8.1.9.211 and VNX1 versions
prior to OE for File 7.1.80.8, a local authenticated user may
potentially escalate their privileges to root due to authorization
checks not being performed on certain perl scripts. This may
potentially be exploited by an attacker to run arbitrary commands as
root on the targeted VNX Control Station system.
