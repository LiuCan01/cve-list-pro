The _bfd_vms_slurp_etir function in bfd/vms-alpha.c in the Binary File
Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer
overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of
this file during "objdump -D" execution.
