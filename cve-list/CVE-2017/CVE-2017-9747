The ieee_archive_p function in bfd/ieee.c in the Binary File Descriptor
(BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, might
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow
and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during
"objdump -D" execution. NOTE: this may be related to a compiler bug.
