A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Small Business Managed
Switches software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
conduct an HTTP response splitting attack against a user of the web
interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the
web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by
intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the
request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or
allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. This
vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business 300 and 500
Series Managed Switches: Cisco 350 Series Managed Switches, Cisco 350X
Series Stackable Managed Switches, Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed
Switches, Cisco ESW2 Series Advanced Switches, Cisco Small Business 300
Series Managed Switches, Cisco Small Business 500 Series Stackable
Managed Switches. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg29980.
