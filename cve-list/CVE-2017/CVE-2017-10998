In all Qualcomm products with Android releases from CAF using the
Linux kernel, in audio_aio_ion_lookup_vaddr, the buffer length, which
is user input, ends up being used to validate if the buffer is fully
within the valid region. If the buffer length is large enough then the
address + length operation could overflow and produce a result far
below the valid region.
