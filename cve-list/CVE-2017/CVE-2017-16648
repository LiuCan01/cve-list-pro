The dvb_frontend_free function in drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c
in the Linux kernel through 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a
denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. NOTE: the function
was later renamed __dvb_frontend_free.
