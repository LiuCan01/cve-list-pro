MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded credentials that are used for
customer database access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded
credentials and the ability to communicate directly with the database
may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial
information. Connex utilizes an IBM i DB2 user account for database
access. The account name is HMSCXPDN. Its password is hard-coded in
multiple places in the application. Customers do not have the option to
change this password. The account has elevated DB2 roles, and can
access all objects or database tables on the customer DB2 database.
This account can access data through ODBC, FTP, and TELNET. Customers
without Connex installed are still vulnerable because the MEDHOST setup
program creates this account.
