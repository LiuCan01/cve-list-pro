Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has CSRF in diag.cgi. In the panel, the
diag.cgi file is responsible for running commands such as ping, ping6,
traceroute, traceroute6, nslookup, arp, and Portprobe. These functions
do not have any protections against CSRF. That can allow an attacker to
run these commands against any IP if they can get an admin to visit
their malicious CSRF page.
