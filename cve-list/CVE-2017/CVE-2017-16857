Reference: CONFIRM:https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-10439

It is possible to bypass the bitbucket auto-unapprove plugin via
minimal brute-force because it is relying on asynchronous events on
the back-end. This allows an attacker to merge any code into
unsuspecting repositories. This affects all versions of the
auto-unapprove plugin, however since the auto-unapprove plugin is not
bundled with Bitbucket Server it does not affect any particular
version of Bitbucket.
