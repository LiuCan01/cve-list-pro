The AT&T U-verse 9.2.2h0d83 firmware for the Arris NVG599 device, when
IP Passthrough mode is not used, configures WAN access to a caserver
https service with the tech account and an empty password, which allows
remote attackers to obtain root privileges by establishing a session on
port 49955 and then installing new software, such as BusyBox with "nc
-l" support.
