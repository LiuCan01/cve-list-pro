In Sophos SurfRight HitmanPro before 3.7.20 Build 286 (included in the
HitmanPro.Alert solution and Sophos Clean), a crafted IOCTL with code
0x22E1C0 might lead to kernel data leaks. Because the leak occurs at
the driver level, an attacker can use this vulnerability to leak some
critical information about the machine such as nt!ExpPoolQuotaCookie.
