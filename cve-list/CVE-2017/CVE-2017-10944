This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.0.14878.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the parsing of ObjStm objects. The issue
results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An
attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was
ZDI-CAN-4846.
