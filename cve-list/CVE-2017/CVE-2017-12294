A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack against a user of the affected system. The vulnerability is due
to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to
the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by
intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the
request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or
allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco
