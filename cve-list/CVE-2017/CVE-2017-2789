When copying filedata into a buffer, JustSystems Ichitaro Office 2016
Trial will calculate two values to determine how much data to copy
from the document. If both of these values are larger than the size of
the buffer, the application will choose the smaller of the two and
trust it to copy data from the file. This value is larger than the
buffer size, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. This
overflow corrupts an offset in the heap used in pointer arithmetic for
writing data and can lead to code execution under the context of the
application.
