Phase: Assigned (20170406)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/commit/7f208dc547f569b689c888103e3b593a48cd1869

The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time
(aka backintime) 1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit
authorization method (unix-process) that is subject to a race condition
(time of check, time of use). With this authorization method, the owner
of a process requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd via
/proc/<pid>/status, by which time the requesting process may have been
replaced by a different process with the same PID that has different
privileges then the original requester.
