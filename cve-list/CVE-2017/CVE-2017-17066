The (1) i2pd before 2.17 and (2) kovri pre-alpha implementations of the
I2P routing protocol do not properly handle Garlic DeliveryTypeTunnel
packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer
over-read, as demonstrated by reading sensitive router memory, aka the
GarlicRust bug.
