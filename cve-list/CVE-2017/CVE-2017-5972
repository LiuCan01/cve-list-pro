The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a
SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network
connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by
an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE:
third parties have been unable to discern any relationship between the
GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code.
