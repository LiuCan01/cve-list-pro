Apache CXF Fediz ships with an OpenId Connect (OIDC) service which has
a Client Registration Service, which is a simple web application that
allows clients to be created, deleted, etc. A CSRF (Cross Style
Request Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in this web
application in Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.0 and 1.3.2, meaning that
a malicious web application could create new clients, or reset
secrets, etc, after the admin user has logged on to the client
registration service and the session is still active.
