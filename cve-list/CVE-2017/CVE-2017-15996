elfcomm.c in readelf in GNU Binutils 2.29 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (excessive memory allocation) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file that triggers a
"buffer overflow on fuzzed archive header," related to an uninitialized
variable, an improper conditional jump, and the
get_archive_member_name, process_archive_index_and_symbols, and
setup_archive functions.
