A command-injection vulnerability exists in a web application on a
custom-built GoAhead web server used on Foscam, Vstarcam, and multiple
white-label IP camera models. The mail-sending form in the mail.htm
page allows an attacker to inject a command into the receiver1 field in
the form; it will be executed with root privileges.
