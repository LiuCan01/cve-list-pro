avahi-daemon in Avahi through 0.6.32 inadvertently responds to IPv6
unicast queries with source addresses that are not on-link, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic
amplification) or obtain potentially sensitive information via
port-5353 UDP packets. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2015-2809.
