Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in EPESI
1.8.1.1. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data (state, element, id, tab, cid) passed to the
"EPESI-master/modules/Utils/RecordBrowser/favorites.php" URL. An
attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in
the context of the vulnerable website.
