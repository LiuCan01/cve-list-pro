A vulnerability in the Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility could
allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading
attack, potentially causing a partial impact to the device
availability, confidentiality, and integrity, aka Insecure Library
Loading. The vulnerability is due to the application loading a
malicious copy of a specific, nondefined DLL file instead of the DLL
file it was expecting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
placing an affected DLL within the search path of the host system. An
exploit could allow the attacker to load a malicious DLL file into the
system, thus partially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and
availability on the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf37955.
