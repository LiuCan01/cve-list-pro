A vulnerability in the ImageID parameter of Cisco Unity Connection
10.5(2) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access files
in arbitrary locations on the filesystem of an affected device. The
issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP
POST parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path
to a desired file location. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd90118.
