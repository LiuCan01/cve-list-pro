concrete5 8.1.0 has CSRF in Thumbnail Editor in the File Manager, which
allows remote attackers to disable the entire installation by merely
tricking an admin into viewing a malicious page involving the
/tools/required/files/importers/imageeditor?fID=1&imgData= URI. This
results in a site-wide denial of service making the site not accessible
to any users or any administrators.
