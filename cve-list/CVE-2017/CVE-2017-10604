When the device is configured to perform account lockout with a
defined period of time, any unauthenticated user attempting to log in
as root with an incorrect password can trigger a lockout of the root
account. When an SRX Series device is in cluster mode, and a cluster
sync or failover operation occurs, then there will be errors
associated with synch or failover while the root account is locked
out. Administrators can confirm if the root account is locked out via
the following command root@device> show system login lockout user root
