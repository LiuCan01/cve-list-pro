** DISPUTED ** The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)
interfaces for PHP through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption and application crash) via operations on
long strings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating "There is no
security issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM
condition. The only attack vector here is denial of service. However,
if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a DoS
vector regardless of GMP's OOM behavior."
