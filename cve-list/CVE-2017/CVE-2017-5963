An issue was discovered in caddy (for TYPO3) before 7.2.10. The
vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied
data in the "paymillToken" HTTP POST parameter passed to the
"caddy/Resources/Public/JavaScript/e-payment/paymill/api/php/payment.php"
URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
