VMware ESXi (6.5 before ESXi650-201710401-BG), Workstation (12.x
before 12.5.8), and Fusion (8.x before 8.5.9) contain a vulnerability
that could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a heap overflow
via a specific set of VNC packets resulting in heap corruption.
Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code
execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
Note: In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC must be
manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. In
addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic through the
built-in firewall.
