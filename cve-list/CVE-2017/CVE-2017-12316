A vulnerability in the Guest Portal login page of Cisco Identity
Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to perform multiple login attempts in excess of the configured login
attempt limit. The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side
login attempt limit enforcement. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending modified login attempts to the Guest Portal
login page. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform brute-force
password attacks on the ISE Guest Portal. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve98518.
