Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents
without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code
execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on
input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective
plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on
this insecure behavior.
