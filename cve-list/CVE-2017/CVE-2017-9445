In systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in
systemd-resolved can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A
malicious DNS server can exploit this via a response with a specially
crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved into allocating a buffer
that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end
of it.
