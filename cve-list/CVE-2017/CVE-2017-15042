An unintended cleartext issue exists in Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x
before 1.9.1. RFC 4954 requires that, during SMTP, the PLAIN auth
scheme must only be used on network connections secured with TLS. The
original implementation of smtp.PlainAuth in Go 1.0 enforced this
requirement, and it was documented to do so. In 2013, upstream issue
#5184, this was changed so that the server may decide whether PLAIN is
acceptable. The result is that if you set up a man-in-the-middle SMTP
server that doesn't advertise STARTTLS and does advertise that PLAIN
auth is OK, the smtp.PlainAuth implementation sends the username and
password.
