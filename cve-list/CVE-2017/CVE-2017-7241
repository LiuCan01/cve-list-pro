A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MantisBT Move
Attachments page (move_attachments_page.php, part of admin tools)
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code through a crafted
'type' parameter, if Content Security Protection (CSP) settings allows
it. This is fixed in 1.3.9, 2.1.3, and 2.2.3. Note that this
vulnerability is not exploitable if the admin tools directory is
removed, as recommended in the "Post-installation and upgrade tasks" of
the MantisBT Admin Guide. A reminder to do so is also displayed on the
login page.
