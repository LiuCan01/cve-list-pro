Code injection vulnerability in Avira Total Security Suite 15.0 (and
earlier), Optimization Suite 15.0 (and earlier), Internet Security
Suite 15.0 (and earlier), and Free Security Suite 15.0 (and earlier)
allows a local attacker to bypass a self-protection mechanism, inject
arbitrary code, and take full control of any Avira process via a
"DoubleAgent" attack. One perspective on this issue is that (1) these
products do not use the Protected Processes feature, and therefore an
attacker can enter an arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under
Image File Execution Options in the registry; (2) the self-protection
mechanism is intended to block all local processes (regardless of
privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these
products; and (3) this mechanism can be bypassed by an attacker who
temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during the attack.
