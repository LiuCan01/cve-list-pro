The Humax Wi-Fi Router model HG100R-* 2.0.6 is prone to an
authentication bypass vulnerability via specially crafted requests to
the management console. The bug is exploitable remotely when the router
is configured to expose the management console. The router is not
validating the session token while returning answers for some methods
in url '/api'. An attacker can use this vulnerability to retrieve
sensitive information such as private/public IP addresses, SSID names,
and passwords.
