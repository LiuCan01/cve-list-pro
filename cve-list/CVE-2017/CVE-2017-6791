A vulnerability in the Trust Verification Service (TVS) of Cisco
Unified Communications Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport
Layer Security (TLS) traffic by the affected software. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by generating incomplete traffic
streams. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny access
to the TVS for an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, until
an administrator restarts the service. Known Affected Releases
10.0(1.10000.24) 10.5(2.10000.5) 11.0(1.10000.10) 9.1(2.10000.28).
