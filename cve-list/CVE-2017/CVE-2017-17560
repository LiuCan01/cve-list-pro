An issue was discovered on Western Digital MyCloud PR4100 2.30.172
devices. The web administration component,
/web/jquery/uploader/multi_uploadify.php, provides multipart upload
functionality that is accessible without authentication and can be used
to place a file anywhere on the device's file system. This allows an
attacker the ability to upload a PHP shell onto the device and obtain
arbitrary code execution as root.
