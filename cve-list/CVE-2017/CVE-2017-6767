A vulnerability in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller
(APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain higher
privileges than the account is assigned. The attacker will be granted
the privileges of the last user to log in, regardless of whether those
privileges are higher or lower than what should have been granted. The
attacker cannot gain root-level privileges. The vulnerability is due
to a limitation with how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) grants
privileges to remotely authenticated users when login occurs via SSH
directly to the local management interface of the APIC. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted
device. The attacker's privilege level will be modified to match that
of the last user to log in via SSH. An exploit could allow the
attacker to gain elevated privileges and perform CLI commands that
should be restricted by the attacker's configured role. Cisco Bug IDs:
