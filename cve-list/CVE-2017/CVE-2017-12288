A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified
Contact Center Express could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the
affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access
sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf09173.
