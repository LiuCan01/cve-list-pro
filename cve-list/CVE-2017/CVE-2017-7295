An issue was discovered in Contiki Operating System 3.0. A
use-after-free vulnerability exists in httpd-simple.c in
cc26xx-web-demo httpd, where upon a connection close event, the
http_state structure was not deallocated properly, resulting in a NULL
pointer dereference in the output processing function. This resulted in
a board crash, which can be used to perform denial of service.
