Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Common Industrial
Protocol (CIP) feature in Cisco IOS 12.4 through 15.6 could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload,
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities
are due to the improper parsing of crafted CIP packets destined to an
affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by
sending crafted CIP packets to be processed by an affected device. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected
device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc43709.
