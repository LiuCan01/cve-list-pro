In K7 Total Security before 15.1.0.305, user-controlled input to the
K7Sentry device is not sufficiently sanitized: the user-controlled
input can be used to compare an arbitrary memory address with a fixed
value, which in turn can be used to read the contents of arbitrary
memory. Similarly, the product crashes upon a \.K7Sentry
DeviceIoControl call with an invalid kernel pointer.
