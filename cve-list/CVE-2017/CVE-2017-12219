A vulnerability in the handling of IP fragments for the Cisco Small
Business SPA300, SPA500, and SPA51x Series IP Phones could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload
unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to the inability to handle many large IP fragments
for reassembly in a short duration. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of IP fragments to the
targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS
condition when the device unexpectedly reloads. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve82586.
