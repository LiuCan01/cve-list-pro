A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 1 (IKEv1) XAUTH
code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to cause a reload of an affected system. The vulnerability is
due to insufficient validation of the IKEv1 XAUTH parameters passed
during an IKEv1 negotiation. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted parameters. Note: Only traffic
directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this
vulnerability. This vulnerability only affects systems configured in
routed firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode. This
vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 or IPv6 traffic. A valid IKEv1
Phase 1 needs to be established to exploit this vulnerability, which
means that an attacker would need to have knowledge of a pre-shared key
or have a valid certificate for phase 1 authentication. This
vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software running on the following
products: Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Cisco ASA 5500 Series
Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation
Firewalls, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series
Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual
Appliance (ASAv), Cisco ASA for Firepower 9300 Series, Cisco ISA 3000
Industrial Security Appliance. Fixed versions: 9.1(7.7) 9.2(4.11)
9.4(4) 9.5(3) 9.6(1.5). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz11685.
