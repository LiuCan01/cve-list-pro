Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki/nv-websocket-client/pull/107

The Java WebSocket client nv-websocket-client does not verify that the
server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL/TLS servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate.
