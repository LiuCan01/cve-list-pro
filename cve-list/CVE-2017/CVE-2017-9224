An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack
out-of-bounds read occurs in match_at() during regular expression
searching. A logical error involving order of validation and access in
match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.
