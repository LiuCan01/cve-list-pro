The GIF decoding function gdImageCreateFromGifCtx in gd_gif_in.c in
the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd), as used in PHP before 5.6.31 and
7.x before 7.1.7, does not zero colorMap arrays before use. A
specially crafted GIF image could use the uninitialized tables to read
~700 bytes from the top of the stack, potentially disclosing sensitive
information.
