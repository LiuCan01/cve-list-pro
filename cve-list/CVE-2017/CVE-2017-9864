** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. An attacker can change the plant time even when not
authenticated in any way. This changes the system time, possibly
affecting lockout policies and random-number generators based on
timestamps, and makes timestamps for data analysis unreliable. NOTE:
the vendor reports that this is largely irrelevant because it only
affects log-entry timestamps, and because the plant time would later
be reset via NTP. (It has never been the case that a lockout policy or
random-number generator was affected.) Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21
and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be
affected.
