Phase: Assigned (20170209)

Reference: MISC:https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017008

An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices.
OxygenOS and HydrogenOS are vulnerable to downgrade attacks. This is
due to a lenient 'updater-script' in OTAs that does not check that the
current version is lower than or equal to the given image's.
Downgrades can occur even on locked bootloaders and without triggering
a factory reset, allowing for exploitation of now-patched
vulnerabilities with access to user data. This vulnerability can be
exploited by a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacker targeting the update
process. This is possible because the update transaction does not
occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, a physical attacker can
reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push
the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).
