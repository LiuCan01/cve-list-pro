In Apache Brooklyn before 0.10.0, the REST server is vulnerable to
cross-site scripting where one authenticated user can cause scripts to
run in the browser of another user authorized to access the first
user's resources. This is due to improper escaping of server-side
content. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this
vulnerability.
