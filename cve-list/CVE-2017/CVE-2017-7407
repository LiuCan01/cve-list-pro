The ourWriteOut function in tool_writeout.c in curl 7.53.1 might allow
physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from
process memory in opportunistic circumstances by reading a workstation
screen during use of a --write-out argument ending in a '%' character,
which leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.
