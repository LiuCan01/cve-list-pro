In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate
internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed
input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory
corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege
boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a
Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create
subaccounts.
