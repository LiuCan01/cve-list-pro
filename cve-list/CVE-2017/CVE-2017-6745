A vulnerability in the cache server within Cisco Videoscape
Distribution Suite (VDS) for Television 3.2(5)ES1 could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition on a targeted appliance. The vulnerability is due to
excessive mapped connections exhausting the allotted resources within
the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
large amounts of inbound traffic to a device with the intention of
overloading certain resources. A successful exploit could cause the
device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc39260.
