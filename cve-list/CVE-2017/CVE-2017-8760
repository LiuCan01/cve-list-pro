An issue was discovered on Accellion FTA devices before FTA_9_12_180.
There is XSS in courier/1000@/index.html with the auth_params
parameter. The device tries to use internal WAF filters to stop
specific XSS Vulnerabilities. However, these can be bypassed by using
some modifications to the payloads, e.g., URL encoding.
