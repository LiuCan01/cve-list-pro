An issue was discovered in Xen 4.5.x through 4.9.x. The function
`__gnttab_cache_flush` handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table
operations. It checks to see if the calling domain is the owner of the
page that is to be operated on. If it is not, the owner's grant table
is checked to see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for
the page in question. However, the function does not check to see if
the owning domain actually has a grant table or not. Some special
domains, such as `DOMID_XEN`, `DOMID_IO` and `DOMID_COW` are created
without grant tables. Hence, if __gnttab_cache_flush operates on a page
owned by these special domains, it will attempt to dereference a NULL
pointer in the domain struct.
