Elastic X-Pack Security versions 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 contain a privilege
escalation bug in the run_as functionality. This bug prevents
transitioning into the specified user specified in a run_as request.
If a role has been created using a template that contains the _user
properties, the behavior of run_as will be incorrect. Additionally if
the run_as user specified does not exist, the transition will not
happen.
