A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server versions prior to 2.2.2 could
allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the system to reload,
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is
due to video calls being made on systems with a particular
configuration. An attacker could exploit this by knowing a valid URI
that directs to a Cisco Meeting Server. An attacker could then make a
video call and cause the system to reload. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve65931.
