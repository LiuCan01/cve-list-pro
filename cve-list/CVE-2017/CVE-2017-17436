An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i
products. There is no encryption of the session between the Android
application and the safe. The website and marketing materials advertise
that this communication channel is encrypted with "Highest Level
Bluetooth Encryption" and "Data transmissions are secure via AES256 bit
encryption." These claims, however, are not true. Moreover, AES256 bit
encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard,
so it would have to be at the application level. This lack of
encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping
on the communications between the application and the safe.
