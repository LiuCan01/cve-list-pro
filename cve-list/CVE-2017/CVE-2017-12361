A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows could allow an
unauthenticated, local attacker to access sensitive communications made
by the Jabber client. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
gain information to conduct additional attacks. The vulnerability is
due to the way Cisco Jabber for Windows handles random number
generation for file folders. An attacker could exploit the
vulnerability by fixing the random number data used to establish Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) connections between clients. An exploit could allow
the attacker to decrypt secure communications made by the Cisco Jabber
for Windows client. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve44806.
