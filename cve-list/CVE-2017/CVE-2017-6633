A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process of Cisco UCS C-Series
Rack Servers 3.0(0.234) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting protection. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of TCP
SYN packets to a specific TCP listening port on an affected device. An
exploit could allow the attacker to cause a specific TCP listening port
to stop accepting new connections, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco
