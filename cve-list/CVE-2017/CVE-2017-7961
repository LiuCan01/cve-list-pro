** DISPUTED ** The cr_tknzr_parse_rgb function in cr-tknzr.c in
libcroco 0.6.11 and 0.6.12 has an "outside the range of representable
values of type long" undefined behavior issue, which might allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted CSS file. NOTE:
third-party analysis reports "This is not a security issue in my view.
The conversion surely is truncating the double into a long value, but
there is no impact as the value is one of the RGB components."
