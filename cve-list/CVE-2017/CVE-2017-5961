An issue was discovered in ionize through 1.0.8. The vulnerability
exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the
"path" HTTP GET parameter passed to the
"ionize-master/themes/admin/javascript/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/codemirror/dialog.php"
URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
