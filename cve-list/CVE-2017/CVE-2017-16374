An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The
vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the JPEG 2000 module.
An invalid JPEG 2000 input code stream leads to a computation where the
pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations
belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive
information, such as object heap addresses, etc.
