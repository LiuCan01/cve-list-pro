An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This
vulnerability is due to a computation that accesses a pointer that has
not been initialized; the computation occurs during internal AST thread
manipulation. In this case, a computation defines a read from an
unexpected memory location. Therefore, an attacker might be able to
read sensitive portions of memory.
