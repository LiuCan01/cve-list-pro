An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the web
management interface used by the Foscam C1 Indoor HD Camera running

allow for a user to inject arbitrary shell characters during account
creation resulting in command injection. An attacker can simply send
an HTTP request to the device to trigger this vulnerability.
