In Golden Frog VyprVPN before 2.15.0.5828 for macOS, the vyprvpnservice
launch daemon has an unprotected XPC service that allows attackers to
update the underlying OpenVPN configuration and the arguments passed to
the OpenVPN binary when executed. An attacker can abuse this
vulnerability by forcing the VyprVPN application to load a malicious
dynamic library every time a new connection is made.
