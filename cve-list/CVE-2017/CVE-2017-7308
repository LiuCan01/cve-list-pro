The packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux
kernel through 4.10.6 does not properly validate certain block-size
data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer
signedness error and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the
CAP_NET_RAW capability is held), via crafted system calls.
