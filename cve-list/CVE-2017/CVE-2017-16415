An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The
vulnerability is caused by a computation that writes data past the end
of the intended buffer; the computation is a part of the functionality
that handles font encodings. The vulnerability is a result of out of
range pointer offset that is used to access sub-elements of an internal
data structure. An attacker can potentially leverage the vulnerability
to corrupt sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.
