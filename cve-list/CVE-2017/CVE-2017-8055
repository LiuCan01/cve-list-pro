WatchGuard Fireware allows user enumeration, e.g., in the Firebox
XML-RPC login handler. A login request that contains a blank password
sent to the XML-RPC agent in Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier returns
different responses for valid and invalid usernames. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to enumerate valid usernames on an affected
Firebox.
