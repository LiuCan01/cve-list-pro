Scrapy 1.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) via large files because arbitrarily many files are read
into memory, which is especially problematic if the files are then
individually written in a separate thread to a slow storage resource,
as demonstrated by interaction between dataReceived (in
core/downloader/handlers/http11.py) and S3FilesStore.
