GitHub Branch Source provides a list of applicable credential IDs to
allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use.
This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using
another vulnerability.
