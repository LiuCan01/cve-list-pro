A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process for the GUI of the Cisco
Identity Services Engine (ISE) 2.1(0.474) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition on an affected device where the ISE GUI may fail to respond
to new or established connection requests. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient TCP rate limiting protection on the GUI. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate
of TCP connections to the GUI. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause the GUI to stop responding while the high rate of connections is
in progress. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc81803.
