The _bfd_coff_read_string_table function in coffgen.c in the Binary
File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU
Binutils 2.29.1, does not properly validate the size of the external
string table, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (excessive memory consumption, or heap-based buffer overflow
and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted COFF binary.
