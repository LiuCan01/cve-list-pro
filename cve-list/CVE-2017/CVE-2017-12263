A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco License Manager software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download and view
files within the application that should be restricted, aka Directory
Traversal. The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied
input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal
techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. An exploit
could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain
sensitive information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd83577.
