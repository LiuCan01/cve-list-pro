A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified
Communications Manager 10.5 through 11.5 could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an
affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access
sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc06608.
