The versados_mkobject function in bfd/versados.c in the Binary File
Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
2.28, does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary
file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D"
execution.
