An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The
logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an
attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of
service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in
customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client
side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that
data should be deleted.
