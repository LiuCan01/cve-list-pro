A malicious DLL preload attack possible on NwSapSetup and Installation
self-extracting program for SAP Plant Connectivity 2.3 and 15.0. It is
possible that SAPSetup / NwSapSetup.exe loads system DLLs like
DWMAPI.dll (located in your Syswow64 / System32 folder) from the
folder the executable is in and not from the system location. The
desired behavior is that system dlls are only loaded from the system
folders. If a dll with the same name as the system dll is located in
the same folder as the executable, this dll is loaded and code is
executed.
