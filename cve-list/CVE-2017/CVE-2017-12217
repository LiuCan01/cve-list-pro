A vulnerability in the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling
Protocol ingress packet handler of Cisco ASR 5500 System Architecture
Evolution (SAE) Gateways could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation
of GPRS Tunneling Protocol packet headers. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending a malformed GPRS Tunneling Protocol
packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to cause the GTPUMGR process on an affected device to restart
unexpectedly, resulting in a partial DoS condition. If the GTPUMGR
process restarts, there could be a brief impact on traffic passing
through the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve07119.
