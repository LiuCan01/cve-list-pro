The Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Version 2.0.3 and prior contained
an undocumented encrypted remote support tunnel (SSH) which auto
initiated from the customer's appliance to Cisco's SSH Hubs in the
Umbrella datacenters. These tunnels were primarily leveraged for remote
support and allowed for authorized/authenticated personnel from the
Cisco Umbrella team to access the appliance remotely and obtain full
control without explicit customer approval. To address this
vulnerability, the Umbrella Virtual Appliance version 2.1.0 now
requires explicit customer approval before an SSH tunnel from the VA to
the Cisco terminating server can be established.
