INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE commands in PostgreSQL 10.x before
10.1, 9.6.x before 9.6.6, and 9.5.x before 9.5.10 disclose table
contents that the invoker lacks privilege to read. These exploits
affect only tables where the attacker lacks full read access but has
both INSERT and UPDATE privileges. Exploits bypass row level security
policies and lack of SELECT privilege.
