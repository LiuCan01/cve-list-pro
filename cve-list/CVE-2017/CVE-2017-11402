An issue has been discovered on the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon
Security Appliance before 03.2.00. Design flaws in OPC classic and in
custom netfilter modules allow an attacker to remotely activate rules
on the firewall and to connect to any TCP port of a protected asset,
thus bypassing the firewall. The attack methodology is a crafted OPC
dynamic port shift.
