F-Secure Software Updater 2.20, as distributed in several F-Secure
products, downloads installation packages over plain http and does not
perform file integrity validation after download. Man-in-the-middle
attackers can replace the file with their own executable which will be
executed under the SYSTEM account. Note that when Software Updater is
configured to install updates automatically, it checks if the
downloaded file is digitally signed by default, but does not check the
author of the signature. When running in manual mode (default), no
signature check is performed.
