Prior to ITMS 8.1 RU4, the Symantec Management Console can be
susceptible to a directory traversal exploit, which is a type of
attack that can occur when there is insufficient security validation /
sanitization of user-supplied input file names, such that characters
representing "traverse to parent directory" are passed through to the
file APIs.
