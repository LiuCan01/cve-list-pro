In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c in Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before
13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before
11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized data disclosure
(media takeover in the RTP stack) is possible with careful timing by an
attacker. The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the
RTP stack that learns the source address of media for a session and
drops any packets that do not originate from the expected address. This
option is enabled by default in Asterisk 11 and above. The "nat" and
"rtp_symmetric" options (for chan_sip and chan_pjsip, respectively)
enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source
address of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This
option is not enabled by default, but is commonly enabled to handle
devices behind NAT. A change was made to the strict RTP support in the
RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs. When
combined with the symmetric RTP support, this introduced an avenue
where media could be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address
when expected, the new code allowed a new source address to be learned
at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received, the strict RTP
support would allow the new address to provide media, and (with
symmetric RTP enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to this new
address, allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker
continued to send traffic, they would continue to receive traffic as
well.
