A vulnerability in the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) code of Cisco IR800
Integrated Services Router Software could allow an unauthenticated,
local attacker to boot an unsigned Hypervisor on an affected device and
compromise the integrity of the system. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient sanitization of user input. An attacker who can access an
affected router via the console could exploit this vulnerability by
entering ROMMON mode and modifying ROMMON variables. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and install
a malicious version of Hypervisor firmware on an affected device. Cisco
