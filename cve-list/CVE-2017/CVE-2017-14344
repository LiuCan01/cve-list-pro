This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on
Jungo WinDriver 12.4.0 and earlier. An attacker must first obtain the
ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order
to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
processing of IOCTL 0x95382673 by the windrvr1240 kernel driver. The
issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied data
which can result in a kernel pool overflow. An attacker can leverage
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of
kernel.
