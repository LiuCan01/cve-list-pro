Isub service in P10 Plus and P10 smart phones with earlier than
VKY-AL00C00B157 versions and earlier than VTR-AL00C00B157 versions has
a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. An attacker tricks a user
into installing a malicious application on the smart phone, and the
application can send given parameter to specific interface, which make
a out-of-bounds array access that results in smart phone restart.
