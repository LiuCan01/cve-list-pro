The Datadog Plugin stores an API key to access the Datadog service in
the global Jenkins configuration. While the API key is stored
encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the
configuration form. This could result in exposure of the API key for
example through browser extensions or cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities. The Datadog Plugin now encrypts the API key
transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.
