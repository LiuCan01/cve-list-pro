** DISPUTED ** The disas_insn function in target/i386/translate.c in
QEMU before 2.9.0, when TCG mode without hardware acceleration is used,
does not limit the instruction size, which allows local users to gain
privileges by creating a modified basic block that injects code into a
setuid program, as demonstrated by procmail. NOTE: the vendor has
stated "this bug does not violate any security guarantees QEMU makes."
