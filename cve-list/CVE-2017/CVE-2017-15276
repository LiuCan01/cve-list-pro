OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content
Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows an
authenticated user to gain superuser privileges: Content Server allows
uploading content using batches (TAR archives). When unpacking TAR
archives, Content Server fails to verify the contents of an archive,
which causes a path traversal vulnerability via symlinks. Because some
files on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this
leads to privilege escalation.
