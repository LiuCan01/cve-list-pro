The bfd_cache_close function in bfd/cache.c in the Binary File
Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
2.29 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a heap use after
free and possibly achieve code execution via a crafted nested archive
file. This issue occurs because incorrect functions are called during
an attempt to release memory. The issue can be addressed by better
input validation in the bfd_generic_archive_p function in
bfd/archive.c.
