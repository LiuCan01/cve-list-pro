Symantec Endpoint Protection prior to SEP 12.1 RU6 MP9 could be
susceptible to a privilege escalation vulnerability, which is a type
of issue that allows a user to gain elevated access to resources that
are normally protected at lower access levels. In the circumstances of
this issue, the capability of exploit is limited by the need to
perform multiple file and directory writes to the local filesystem and
as such, is not feasible in a standard drive-by type attack.
