Cisco IOS 12.0 through 15.6, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
7.0.1 through 9.7.1.2, NX-OS 4.0 through 12.0, and IOS XE 3.6 through
3.18 are affected by a vulnerability involving the Open Shortest Path
First (OSPF) Routing Protocol Link State Advertisement (LSA) database.
This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing
table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic. The
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted OSPF
packets. Successful exploitation could cause the targeted router to
flush its routing table and propagate the crafted OSPF LSA type 1
update throughout the OSPF AS domain. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must accurately determine certain parameters within the LSA
database on the target router. This vulnerability can only be triggered
by sending crafted unicast or multicast OSPF LSA type 1 packets. No
other LSA type packets can trigger this vulnerability. OSPFv3 is not
affected by this vulnerability. Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF)
protocol is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCva74756, CSCve47393, CSCve47401.
