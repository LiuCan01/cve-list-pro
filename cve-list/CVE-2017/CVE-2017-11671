Under certain circumstances, the ix86_expand_builtin function in i386.c
in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5 before
5.5, and 6 before 6.4 will generate instruction sequences that clobber
the status flag of the RDRAND and RDSEED intrinsics before it can be
read, potentially causing failures of these instructions to go
unreported. This could potentially lead to less randomness in random
number generation.
