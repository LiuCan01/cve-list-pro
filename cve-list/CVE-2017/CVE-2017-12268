A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) of Cisco AnyConnect
Secure Mobility Client could allow an authenticated, local attacker to
enable multiple network adapters, aka a Dual-Homed Interface
vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insufficient NAM policy
enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
manipulating network interfaces of the device to allow multiple active
network interfaces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
send traffic over a non-authorized network interface. Cisco Bug IDs:
