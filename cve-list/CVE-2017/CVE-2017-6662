A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Prime
Infrastructure (PI) and Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM)
could allow an authenticated, remote attacker read and write access to
information stored in the affected system as well as perform remote
code execution. The attacker must have valid user credentials. The
vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE)
entries when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to
import a crafted XML file with malicious entries which could allow the
attacker to read and write files and execute remote code within the
application, aka XML Injection. Cisco Prime Infrastructure software
releases 1.1 through 3.1.6 are vulnerable. Cisco EPNM software releases
1.2, 2.0, and 2.1 are vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc23894 CSCvc49561.
