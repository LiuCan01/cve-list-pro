Reference: MISC:https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/290

** DISPUTED ** Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
BigTree CMS through 4.2.18 allow remote authenticated users to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML by uploading a crafted package, triggering
mishandling of the (1) title or (2) version or (3) author_name
parameter in manifest.json. This issue exists in
coreadminmodulesdeveloperextensionsinstallunpack.php and
coreadminmodulesdeveloperpackagesinstallunpack.php. NOTE: the
vendor states "You must implicitly trust any package or extension you
install as they all have the ability to write PHP files."
