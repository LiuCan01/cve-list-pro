In the ihevcd_allocate_static_bufs and ihevcd_create functions of
SoftHEVC, there is a possible out-of-bounds write due to a use after
free. Both ps_codec_obj and ps_create_op->s_ivd_create_op_t.pv_handle
point to the same memory and ps_codec_obj could be freed without
clearing ps_create_op->s_ivd_create_op_t.pv_handle. This could lead to
remote code execution as a privileged process with no additional
execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for
exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2,
8.0, 8.1. Android ID: A-66969193.
