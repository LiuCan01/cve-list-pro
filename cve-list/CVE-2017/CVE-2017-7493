Quick Emulator (Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing
via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper
access control issue. It could occur while accessing virtfs metadata
files in mapped-file security mode. A guest user could use this flaw
to escalate their privileges inside guest.
