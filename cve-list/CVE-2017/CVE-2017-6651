A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow
unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain information that could allow
them to access scheduled customer meetings. The vulnerability is due to
an incomplete configuration of the robots.txt file on customer-hosted
WebEx solutions and occurs when the Short URL functionality is not
activated. All releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server later than
release 2.5MR4 provide this functionality. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability via an exposed parameter to search for indexed
meeting information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
obtain scheduled meeting information and potentially allow the attacker
to attend scheduled, customer meetings. This vulnerability affects the
following releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server: 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8.
Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve25950.
