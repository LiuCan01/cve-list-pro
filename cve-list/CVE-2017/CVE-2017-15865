bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) before 2.0.2 and 3.x before 3.0.2, as used in
Cumulus Linux before 3.4.3 and other products, allows remote attackers
to obtain sensitive information via a malformed BGP UPDATE packet from
a connected peer, which triggers transmission of up to a few thousand
unintended bytes because of a mishandled attribute length, aka RN-690
(CM-18492).
