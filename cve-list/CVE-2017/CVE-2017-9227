An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack
out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression
searching. Invalid handling of reg->dmin in forward_search_range()
could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds
read from a stack buffer.
