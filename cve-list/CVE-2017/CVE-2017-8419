LAME through 3.99.5 relies on the signed integer data type for values
in a WAV or AIFF header, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow or heap-based buffer
overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file,
as demonstrated by mishandling of num_channels.
