Reference: MISC:https://www.twistlock.com/2017/07/13/cve-2017-9951-heap-overflow-memcached-server-1-4-38-twistlock-vulnerability-report/

The try_read_command function in memcached.c in memcached before 1.4.39
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
fault) via a request to add/set a key, which makes a comparison between
signed and unsigned int and triggers a heap-based buffer over-read.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2016-8705.
