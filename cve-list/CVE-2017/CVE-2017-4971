An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Web Flow through 2.4.4.
Applications that do not change the value of the MvcViewFactoryCreator
useSpringBinding property which is disabled by default (i.e., set to
'false') can be vulnerable to malicious EL expressions in view states
that process form submissions but do not have a sub-element to declare
explicit data binding property mappings.
