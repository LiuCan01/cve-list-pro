Invision Power Services (IPS) Community Suite 4.1.19.2 and earlier has
a composite of Stored XSS and Information Disclosure issues in the
attachments feature found in User CP. This can be triggered by any
Invision Power Board user and can be used to gain access to
moderator/admin accounts. The primary cause is the ability to upload an
SVG document with a crafted attribute such an onload; however, full
path disclosure is required for exploitation.
