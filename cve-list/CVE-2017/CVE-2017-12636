CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via
HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating
system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This
allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before
2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user,
including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet.
