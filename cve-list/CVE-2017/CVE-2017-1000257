An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data,
in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes,
libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the
size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data
function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the
data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based
buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond
the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then
deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.
