A vulnerability in the Ultra Automation Service (UAS) of the Cisco
Ultra Services Framework could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to gain unauthorized access to a targeted device. The
vulnerability is due to an insecure default configuration of the Apache
ZooKeeper service used by the affected software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by accessing the affected device through the
orchestrator network. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain
access to ZooKeeper data nodes (znodes) and influence the behavior of
the system's high-availability feature. This vulnerability affects all
releases of Cisco Ultra Services Framework UAS prior to Releases 5.0.3
and 5.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd29395.
