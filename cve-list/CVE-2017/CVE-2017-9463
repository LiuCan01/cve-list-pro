The application Piwigo is affected by a SQL injection vulnerability in
version 2.9.0 and possibly prior. This vulnerability allows remote
authenticated attackers to obtain information in the context of the
user used by the application to retrieve data from the database. The
user_list_backend.php component is affected: values of the
iDisplayStart & iDisplayLength parameters are not sanitized; these are
used to construct a SQL query and retrieve a list of registered users
into the application.
