A network interface of the novi_process_manager_daemon service,
included in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and
deployed on NoviSwitch devices, can be inadvertently exposed if an
operator attempts to modify ACLs, because of a bug when ACL
modifications are applied. This could be leveraged by remote,
unauthenticated attackers to gain resultant privileged (root) code
execution on the switch, because incoming packet data can contain
embedded OS commands, and can also trigger a stack-based buffer
overflow.
