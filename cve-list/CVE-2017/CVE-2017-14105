HiveManager Classic through 8.1r1 allows arbitrary JSP code execution
by modifying a backup archive before a restore, because the restore
feature does not validate pathnames within the archive. An
authenticated, local attacker - even restricted as a tenant - can add a
jsp at HiveManager/tomcat/webapps/hm/domains/$yourtenant/maps (it will
be exposed at the web interface).
