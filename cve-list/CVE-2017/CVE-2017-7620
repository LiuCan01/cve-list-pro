MantisBT before 1.3.11, 2.x before 2.3.3, and 2.4.x before 2.4.1 omits
a backslash check in string_api.php and consequently has conflicting
interpretations of an initial / substring as introducing either a
local pathname or a remote hostname, which leads to (1) arbitrary
Permalink Injection via CSRF attacks on a permalink_page.php?url= URI
and (2) an open redirect via a login_page.php?return= URI.
