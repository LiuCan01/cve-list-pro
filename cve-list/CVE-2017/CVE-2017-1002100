Default access permissions for Persistent Volumes (PVs) created by the
Kubernetes Azure cloud provider in versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.5 are set to
"container" which exposes a URI that can be accessed without
authentication on the public internet. Access to the URI string
requires privileged access to the Kubernetes cluster or authenticated
access to the Azure portal.
