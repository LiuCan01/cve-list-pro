An issue was discovered in sysPass 2.x before 2.1, in which an
algorithm was never sufficiently reviewed by cryptographers. The fact
that inc/SP/Core/Crypt.class is using the MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256()
function (the 256-bit block version of Rijndael, not AES) instead of
MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 (real AES) could help an attacker to create unknown
havoc in the remote system.
