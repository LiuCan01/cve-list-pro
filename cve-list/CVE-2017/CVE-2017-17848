An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. In a variant of
CVE-2017-17847, signature spoofing is possible for multipart/related
messages because a signed message part can be referenced with a cid:
URI but not actually displayed. In other words, the entire containing
message appears to be signed, but the recipient does not see any of the
signed text.
