Reference: CONFIRM:https://community.rapid7.com/community/nexpose/blog/2017/05/31/r7-2017-13-nexpose-hardware-appliance-ssh-enabled-obsolete-algorithms-cve-2017-5243

The default SSH configuration in Rapid7 Nexpose hardware appliances
shipped before June 2017 does not specify desired algorithms for key
exchange and other important functions. As a result, it falls back to
allowing ALL algorithms supported by the relevant version of OpenSSH
and makes the installations vulnerable to a range of MITM, downgrade,
and decryption attacks.
