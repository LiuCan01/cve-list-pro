D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1)
and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02) devices use the same
hardcoded /etc/stunnel.key private key across different customers'
installations, which allows remote attackers to defeat the HTTPS
cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this key
from another installation.
