A vulnerability in the cluster database (CDB) management component of
Cisco Expressway Series Software and Cisco TelePresence Video
Communication Server (VCS) Software could allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to cause the CDB process on an affected system to
restart unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS)
condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of
URL requests by the REST API of the affected software. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the REST
API of the affected software on an affected system. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CDB process on the
affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS
condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77571.
