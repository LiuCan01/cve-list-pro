An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the HTTP server
implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. An ordinary HTTP POST request
with a CGI target can cause a reuse of previously freed pointer
potentially resulting in remote code execution. An attacker needs to
send this HTTP request over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
