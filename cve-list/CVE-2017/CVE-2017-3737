OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error
state" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during
a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would
immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This
works as designed for the explicit handshake functions
(SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a
bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called
directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error
will be returned in the initial function call. If
SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for
the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed
without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record
layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to
be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being
issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version
1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is
not affected.
