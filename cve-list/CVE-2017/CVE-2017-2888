An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when creating a
new RGB Surface in SDL 2.0.5. A specially crafted file can cause an
integer overflow resulting in too little memory being allocated which
can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An
attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this
vulnerability.
