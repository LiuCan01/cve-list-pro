A vulnerability in the web user interface of Cisco IOS XE 3.1 through
3.17 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an
affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
resource handling by the affected software when the web user interface
is under a high load. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a high number of requests to the web user interface of the
affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service
(DoS) condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have
access to the management interface of the affected software, which is
typically connected to a restricted management network. This
vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable
release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the web user interface of the
software is enabled. By default, the web user interface is not enabled.
