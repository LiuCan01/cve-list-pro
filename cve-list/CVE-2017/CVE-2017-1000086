The Periodic Backup Plugin did not perform any permission checks,
allowing any user with Overall/Read access to change its settings,
trigger backups, restore backups, download backups, and also delete
all previous backups via log rotation. Additionally, the plugin was
not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening
itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
