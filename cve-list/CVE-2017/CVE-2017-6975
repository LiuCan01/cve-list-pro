Wi-Fi in Apple iOS before 10.3.1 does not prevent CVE-2017-6956 stack
buffer overflow exploitation via a crafted access point.  NOTE: because
an operating system could potentially isolate itself from
CVE-2017-6956 exploitation without patching Broadcom firmware
functions, there is a separate CVE ID for the operating-system
behavior.
