In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in cine_read_header() due to lack of an EOF
check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted CINE
file, which claims a large "duration" field in the header but does not
contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the image-offset parsing
loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF
check inside the loop.
