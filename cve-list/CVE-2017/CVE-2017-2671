The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel
through 4.10.8 is too late in obtaining a certain lock and
consequently cannot ensure that disconnect function calls are safe,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by
leveraging access to the protocol value of IPPROTO_ICMP in a socket
system call.
