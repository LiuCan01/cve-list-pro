** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication
with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection
attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to
successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere
within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it
from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP
vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP
communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is
unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can
eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted.
NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is
not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21
and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be
affected.
