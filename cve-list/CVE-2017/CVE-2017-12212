A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unity Connection could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface
of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation of certain parameters that are passed to the affected
software via the HTTP GET and HTTP POST methods. An attacker who can
convince a user to follow an attacker-supplied link could execute
arbitrary script or HTML code in the user's browser in the context of
an affected site. Known Affected Releases 10.5(2). Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvf25345.
