An issue was discovered in Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security
(Virtual Appliance) 9.1-1600. An authenticated user can execute a
terminal command in the context of the web server user (which is root).
Besides, the default installation of IMSVA comes with default
administrator credentials. The saveCert.imss endpoint takes several
user inputs and performs blacklisting. After that, it uses them as
arguments to a predefined operating-system command without proper
sanitization. However, because of an improper blacklisting rule, it's
possible to inject arbitrary commands into it.
