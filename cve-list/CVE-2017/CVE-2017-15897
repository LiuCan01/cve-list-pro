Node.js had a bug in versions 8.X and 9.X which caused buffers to not
be initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the
encoding specified. For example, 'Buffer.alloc(0x100, "This is not
correctly encoded", "hex");' The buffer implementation was updated
such that the buffer will be initialized to all zeros in these cases.
