In vBulletin through 5.3.x, there is an unauthenticated deserialization
vulnerability that leads to arbitrary file deletion and, under certain
circumstances, code execution, because of unsafe usage of PHP's
unserialize() in vB_Library_Template's cacheTemplates() function, which
is a publicly exposed API. This is exploited with the templateidlist
parameter to ajax/api/template/cacheTemplates.
