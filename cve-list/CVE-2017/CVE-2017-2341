An insufficient authentication vulnerability on platforms where Junos
OS instances are run in a virtualized environment, may allow
unprivileged users on the Junos OS instance to gain access to the host
operating environment, and thus escalate privileges. Affected releases

QFX5200, QFX10002, QFX10008, QFX10016, EX4600 and NFX250; 15.1 prior

issue does not affect vMX. No other Juniper Networks products or
platforms are affected by this issue.
