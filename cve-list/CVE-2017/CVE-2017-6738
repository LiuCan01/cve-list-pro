The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS
12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.6 and IOS XE 2.2 through 3.17
contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause
an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these
vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system
via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be
used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a
buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected
software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP: Versions 1,
2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or
earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for
the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version
3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. All
devices that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the
affected MIBs or OIDs should be considered vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve89865, CSCsy56638.
