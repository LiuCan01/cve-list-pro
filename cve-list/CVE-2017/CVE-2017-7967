All versions of VAMPSET software produced by Schneider Electric, prior
to V2.2.189, are susceptible to a memory corruption vulnerability when
a corrupted vf2 file is used. This vulnerability causes the software
to halt or not start when trying to open the corrupted file. This
vulnerability occurs when fill settings are intentionally malformed
and is opened in a standalone state, without connection to a
protection relay. This attack is not considered to be remotely
exploitable. This vulnerability has no effect on the operation of the
protection relay to which VAMPSET is connected. As Windows operating
system remains operational and VAMPSET responds, it is able to be shut
down through its normal closing protocol.
