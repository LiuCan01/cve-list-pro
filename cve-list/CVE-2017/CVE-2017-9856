** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. Sniffed passwords from SMAdata2+ communication can be
decrypted very easily. The passwords are "encrypted" using a very
simple encryption algorithm. This enables an attacker to find the
plaintext passwords and authenticate to the device. NOTE: the vendor
reports that only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10
and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
