FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3
allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete
fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by
sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the
ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring
libraries are available in the classpath.
