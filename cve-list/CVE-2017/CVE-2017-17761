An issue was discovered on Ichano AtHome IP Camera devices. The device
runs the "noodles" binary - a service on port 1300 that allows a remote
(LAN) unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands. This binary
requires the "system" XML element for specifying the command. For
example, a <system>id</system> command results in a
<system_ack>ok</system_ack> response.
