An issue was discovered on FiberHome User End Routers Bearing Model
Number AN1020-25 which could allow an attacker to easily restore a
router to its factory settings by simply browsing to the link
http://[Default-Router-IP]/restoreinfo.cgi & execute it. Due to
improper authentication on this page, the software accepts the request
hence allowing attacker to reset the router to its default
configurations which later could allow attacker to login to router by
using default username/password.
