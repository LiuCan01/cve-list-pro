libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily
trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note
that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously
stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be
incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was
vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in
version 3.1.
