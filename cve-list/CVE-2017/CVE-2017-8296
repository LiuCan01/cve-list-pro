kedpm 0.5 and 1.0 creates a history file in ~/.kedpm/history that is
written in cleartext. All of the commands performed in the password
manager are written there. This can lead to the disclosure of the
master password if the "password" command is used with an argument. The
names of the password entries created and consulted are also accessible
in cleartext.
