In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.3, 13.x before 13.17.2, and 14.x before
14.6.2 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert18 and 13.x before
13.13-cert6, insufficient RTCP packet validation could allow reading
stale buffer contents and when combined with the "nat" and
"symmetric_rtp" options allow redirecting where Asterisk sends the
next RTCP report.
