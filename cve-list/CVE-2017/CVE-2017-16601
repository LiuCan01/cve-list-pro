This vulnerability allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary
files on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise
Manager 7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to
exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can
be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.templates.service.service_005ffailures_jsp
servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the
filename parameter, the process does not properly validate a
user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker
can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite any files accessible to
the Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5192.
