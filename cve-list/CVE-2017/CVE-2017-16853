The DynamicMetadataProvider class in
saml/saml2/metadata/impl/DynamicMetadataProvider.cpp in OpenSAML-C in
OpenSAML before 2.6.1 fails to properly configure itself with the
MetadataFilter plugins and does not perform critical security checks
such as signature verification, enforcement of validity periods, and
other checks specific to deployments, aka CPPOST-105.
