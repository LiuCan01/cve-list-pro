In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in
`HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded
public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be
allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC
KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables
symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the
PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft
JWTs from scratch.
