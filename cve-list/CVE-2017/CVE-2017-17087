fileio.c in Vim prior to 8.0.1263 sets the group ownership of a .swp
file to the editor's primary group (which may be different from the
group ownership of the original file), which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information by leveraging an applicable group
membership, as demonstrated by /etc/shadow owned by root:shadow mode
0640, but /etc/.shadow.swp owned by root:users mode 0640, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2017-1000382.
