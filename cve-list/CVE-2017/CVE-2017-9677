In all Qualcomm products with Android releases from CAF using the
Linux kernel, in function msm_compr_ioctl_shared, variable
"ddp->params_length" could be accessed and modified by multiple
threads, while it is not protected with locks. If one thread is
running, while another thread is setting data, race conditions will
happen. If "ddp->params_length" is set to a big number, a buffer
overflow will occur.
