Apache Ignite 1.0.0-RC3 to 2.0 uses an update notifier component to
update the users about new project releases that include additional
functionality, bug fixes and performance improvements. To do that the
component communicates to an external PHP server (http://ignite.run)
where it needs to send some system properties like Apache Ignite or
Java version. Some of the properties might contain user sensitive
information.
