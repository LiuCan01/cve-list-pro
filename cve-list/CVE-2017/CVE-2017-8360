Conexant Systems mictray64 task, as used on HP Elite, EliteBook,
ProBook, and ZBook systems, leaks sensitive data (keystrokes) to any
process. In mictray64.exe (mic tray icon) 1.0.0.46, a
LowLevelKeyboardProc Windows hook is used to capture keystrokes. This
data is leaked via unintended channels: debug messages accessible to
any process that is running in the current user session, and filesystem
access to C:UsersPublicMicTray.log by any process.
