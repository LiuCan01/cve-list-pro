There is a heap based buffer overflow in tools/tiff2pdf.c of LibTIFF
4.0.8 via a PlanarConfig=Contig image, which causes a more than one
hundred bytes out-of-bounds write (related to the ZIPDecode function in
tif_zip.c). A crafted input may lead to a remote denial of service
attack or an arbitrary code execution attack.
