A vulnerability in the Smart Licensing Manager service of the Cisco
Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Firepower
9300 Security Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
to inject arbitrary commands that could be executed with root
privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation
of certain Smart Licensing configuration parameters. An authenticated
attacker could exploit the vulnerability by configuring a malicious URL
within the affected feature. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This
vulnerability affects the following Cisco Firepower Security products
running FX-OS code trains 1.1.3, 1.1.4, and 2.0.1 (versions 2.1.1,
2.2.1, and 2.2.2 are not affected): Firepower 4100 Series
Next-Generation Firewall and Firepower 9300 Security Appliance. Cisco
