A vulnerability in the SQL database interface for Cisco Emergency
Responder could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a
blind SQL injection attack. The vulnerability is due to a failure to
validate user-supplied input used in SQL queries that bypass protection
filters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
crafted URLs that include SQL statements. An exploit could allow the
attacker to view or modify entries in some database tables, affecting
the integrity of the data. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb58973.
