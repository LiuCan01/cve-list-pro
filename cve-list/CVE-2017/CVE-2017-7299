The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, has an invalid read (of size 8) because the code
to emit relocs (bfd_elf_final_link function in bfd/elflink.c) does not
check the format of the input file before trying to read the ELF reloc
section header. The vulnerability leads to a GNU linker (ld) program
crash.
