A vulnerability in certain commands of Cisco Elastic Services
Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate
privileges to root and run dangerous commands on the server. The
vulnerability occurs because a "tomcat" user on the system can run
certain shell commands, allowing the user to overwrite any file on the
filesystem and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability affects
Cisco Elastic Services Controller prior to releases 2.3.1.434 and
2.3.2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76634.
