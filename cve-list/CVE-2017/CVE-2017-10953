This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.0.14878. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the gotoURL method. The issue results from
the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using
it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current
process. Was ZDI-CAN-5030.
