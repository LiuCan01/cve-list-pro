In Apache Spark 1.6.0 until 2.1.1, the launcher API performs unsafe
deserialization of data received by its socket. This makes
applications launched programmatically using the launcher API
potentially vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by an attacker with
access to any user account on the local machine. It does not affect
apps run by spark-submit or spark-shell. The attacker would be able to
execute code as the user that ran the Spark application. Users are
encouraged to update to version 2.2.0 or later.
