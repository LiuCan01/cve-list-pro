A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence
Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a
Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting attack. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some
parameters passed to the web server. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link or by
intercepting the user request and injecting the malicious code. An
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive
browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve76848, CSCve76856.
