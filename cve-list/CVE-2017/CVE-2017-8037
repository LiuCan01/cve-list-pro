Name: CVE-2017-8037
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8037

Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.cloudfoundry.org/cve-2017-8037/

In Cloud Foundry Foundation CAPI-release versions after v1.6.0 and
prior to v1.38.0 and cf-release versions after v244 and prior to v270,
there is an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-8035. If you took steps to
remediate CVE-2017-8035 you should also upgrade to fix this CVE. A
carefully crafted CAPI request from a Space Developer can allow them to
gain access to files on the Cloud Controller VM for that installation,
aka an Information Leak / Disclosure.
