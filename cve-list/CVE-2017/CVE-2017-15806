The send function in the ezcMailMtaTransport class in Zeta Components
Mail before 1.8.2 does not properly restrict the set of characters
used in the ezcMail returnPath property, which might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted email address, as
demonstrated by one containing "-X/path/to/wwwroot/file.php."
