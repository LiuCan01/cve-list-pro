In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML
autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the
technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed
a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect
most production sites since you shouldn't run with "DEBUG = True"
(which makes this page accessible) in your production settings.
