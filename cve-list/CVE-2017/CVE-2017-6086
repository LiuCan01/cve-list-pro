Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the
addAction and purgeAction functions in ViMbAdmin 3.0.15 allow remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of logged administrators to (1)
add an administrator user via a crafted POST request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/DomainController.php, (2) remove an
administrator user via a crafted GET request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/DomainController.php, (3) change an
administrator password via a crafted POST request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/DomainController.php, (4) add a
mailbox via a crafted POST request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/MailboxController.php, (5) delete a
mailbox via a crafted POST request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/MailboxController.php, (6) archive
a mailbox address via a crafted GET request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/ArchiveController.php, (7) add an
alias address via a crafted POST request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/AliasController.php, or (8) remove
an alias address via a crafted GET request to <vimbadmin
directory>/application/controllers/AliasController.php.
