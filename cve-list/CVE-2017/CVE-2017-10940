This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Joyent Smart Data Center prior to
agentsshar@1.0.0-release-20160901-20160901T051624Z-g3fd5adf
(e469cf49-4de3-4658-8419-ab42837916ad). An attacker must first obtain
the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in
order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within
the docker API. The process does not properly validate user-supplied
data which can allow for the upload of arbitrary files. An attacker
can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the
context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-3853.
