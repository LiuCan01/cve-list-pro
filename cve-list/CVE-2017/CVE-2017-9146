The TNEFFillMapi function in lib/ytnef.c in libytnef in ytnef through
1.9.2 does not ensure a nonzero count value before a certain memory
allocation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted tnef file.
