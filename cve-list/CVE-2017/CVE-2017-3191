D-Link DIR-130 firmware version 1.23 and DIR-330 firmware version 1.12
are vulnerable to authentication bypass of the remote login page. A
remote attacker that can access the remote management login page can
manipulate the POST request in such a manner as to access some
administrator-only pages such as tools_admin.asp without credentials.
