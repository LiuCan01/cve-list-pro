While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to
application listeners in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.5.0 to
8.5.11, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.75 did not use the
appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under
a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted
application to retain a reference to the request or response object
and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another
web application.
