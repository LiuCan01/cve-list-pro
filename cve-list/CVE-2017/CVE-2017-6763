A vulnerability in the implementation of the H.264 protocol in Cisco
Meeting Server (CMS) 2.1.4 could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
system. The vulnerability exists because the affected application does
not properly validate Fragmentation Unit (FU-A) protocol packets. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted H.264
FU-A packet through the affected application. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected
system due to an unexpected restart of the CMS media process on the
system. Although the CMS platform continues to operate and only the
single, affected CMS media process is restarted, a brief interruption
of media traffic for certain users could occur. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve10131.
