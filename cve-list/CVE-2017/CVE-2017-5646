Reference: MLIST:[knox-user] 20170526 [ANNOUNCE] CVE-2017-5646: Apache Knox Impersonation Issue for WebHDFS
Reference: URL:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/knox-user/201705.mbox/%3CCACRbFyjtT7QQGHUzTRdbJoySbJb7tt4BDk5-r-VRn0GB0Kgvag%40mail.gmail.com%3E
Reference: BID:98739

For versions of Apache Knox from 0.2.0 to 0.11.0 - an authenticated
user may use a specially crafted URL to impersonate another user while
accessing WebHDFS through Apache Knox. This may result in escalated
privileges and unauthorized data access. While this activity is audit
logged and can be easily associated with the authenticated user, this
is still a serious security issue. All users are recommended to
upgrade to the Apache Knox 0.12.0 release.
