The Bastet driver of Honor 9 Huawei smart phones with software of
versions earlier than Stanford-AL10C00B175 has integer overflow
vulnerability due to the lack of parameter validation. An attacker
tricks a user into installing a malicious APP which has the root
privilege; the APP can send a specific parameter to the driver of the
smart phone, causing arbitrary code execution.
