The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 and an
invalid write of size 1 during processing of a corrupt binary
containing reloc(s) with negative addresses. This vulnerability causes
programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd
library, such as objdump, to crash.
