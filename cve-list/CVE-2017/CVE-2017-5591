An incorrect implementation of "XEP-0280: Message Carbons" in multiple
XMPP clients allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user,
including contacts, in the vulnerable application's display. This
allows for various kinds of social engineering attacks. This CVE is for
SleekXMPP up to 1.3.1 and Slixmpp all versions up to 1.2.3, as bundled
in poezio (0.8 - 0.10) and other products.
