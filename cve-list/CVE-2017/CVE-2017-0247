A denial of service vulnerability exists when the ASP.NET Core fails
to properly validate web requests. NOTE: Microsoft has not commented
on third-party claims that the issue is that the
TextEncoder.EncodeCore function in the System.Text.Encodings.Web
package in ASP.NET Core Mvc before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.3 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service by leveraging failure to
properly calculate the length of 4-byte characters in the Unicode
Non-Character range.
