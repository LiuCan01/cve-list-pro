A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device, aka
HREF XSS. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an
affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access
sensitive browser-based information. The vulnerability exists in the
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software when the WEBVPN
feature is enabled. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve91068.
