It was noticed that a malicious process impersonating an Impala daemon
in Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 could cause Impala
daemons to skip authentication checks when Kerberos is enabled (but
TLS is not). If the malicious server responds with 'COMPLETE' before
the SASL handshake has completed, the client will consider the
handshake as completed even though no exchange of credentials has
happened.
