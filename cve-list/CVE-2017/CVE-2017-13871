An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. macOS before
10.13.2 is affected. The issue involves the "Mail" component. It
allows remote attackers to read cleartext e-mail content (for which
S/MIME encryption was intended) by leveraging the lack of installation
of an S/MIME certificate by the recipient.
