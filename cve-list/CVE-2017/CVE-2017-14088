Memory Corruption Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities in Trend Micro
OfficeScan 11.0 and XG allows local attackers to execute arbitrary
code and escalate privileges to resources normally reserved for the
kernel on vulnerable installations by exploiting tmwfp.sys. An
attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code
on the target system in order to exploit the vulnerability.
