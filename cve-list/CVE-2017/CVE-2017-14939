decode_line_info in dwarf2.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, mishandles a
length calculation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a
crafted ELF file, related to read_1_byte.
