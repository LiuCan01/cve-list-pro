An issue was discovered in contexts_wurfl (for TYPO3) before 0.4.2. The
vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied
data in the "force_ua" HTTP GET parameter passed to the
"/contexts_wurfl/Library/wurfl-dbapi-1.4.4.0/check_wurfl.php" URL. An
attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in
the context of the vulnerable website.
