In Wireshark through 2.0.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.7, the WBXML
dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection
or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in
epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding validation of the
relationships between indexes and lengths. NOTE: this vulnerability
exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7702.
