OxygenOS before version 4.0.2, on OnePlus 3 and 3T, has two hidden
fastboot oem commands (4F500301 and 4F500302) that allow the attacker
to lock/unlock the bootloader, disregarding the 'OEM Unlocking'
checkbox, without user confirmation and without a factory reset. This
allows for persistent code execution with high privileges (kernel/root)
with complete access to user data.
