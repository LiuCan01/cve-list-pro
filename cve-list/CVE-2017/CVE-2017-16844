Heap-based buffer overflow in the loadbuf function in formisc.c in
formail in procmail 3.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
crafted e-mail message because of a hardcoded realloc size, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2014-3618.
