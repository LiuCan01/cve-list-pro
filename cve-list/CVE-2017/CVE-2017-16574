This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
specific flaw exists within the parsing of Image filters. The issue
results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An
attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
to execute code in the context of the current process. Was
ZDI-CAN-5079.
