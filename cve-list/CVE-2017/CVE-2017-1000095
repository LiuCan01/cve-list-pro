Name: CVE-2017-1000095
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000095
Phase: Assigned (20170713)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-07-10/

The default whitelist included the following unsafe entries:
DefaultGroovyMethods.putAt(Object, String, Object);
DefaultGroovyMethods.getAt(Object, String). These allowed
circumventing many of the access restrictions implemented in the
script sandbox by using e.g. currentBuild['rawBuild'] rather than
currentBuild.rawBuild. Additionally, the following entries allowed
accessing private data that would not be accessible otherwise due to
script security: groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Closure);
groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson(Object).
