Reference: MISC:https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/291

** DISPUTED ** BigTree CMS through 4.2.18 allows remote authenticated
users to execute arbitrary code by uploading a crafted package
containing a PHP web shell, related to extraction of a ZIP archive to
filename patterns such as cache/package/xxx/yyy.php. This issue exists
in coreadminmodulesdeveloperextensionsinstallunpack.php and
coreadminmodulesdeveloperpackagesinstallunpack.php. NOTE: the
vendor states "You must implicitly trust any package or extension you
install as they all have the ability to write PHP files."
