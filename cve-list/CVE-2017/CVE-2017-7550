A flaw was found in the way Ansible (2.3.x before 2.3.3, and 2.4.x
before 2.4.1) passed certain parameters to the jenkins_plugin module.
Remote attackers could use this flaw to expose sensitive information
from a remote host's logs. This flaw was fixed by not allowing
passwords to be specified in the "params" argument, and noting this in
the module documentation.
