An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. macOS before 10.13
Supplemental Update is affected. The issue involves the "StorageKit"
component. It allows attackers to discover passwords for APFS
encrypted volumes by reading Disk Utility hints, because the stored
hint value was accidentally set to the password itself, not the
entered hint value.
