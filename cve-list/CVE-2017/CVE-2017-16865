Reference: CONFIRM:https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66642

The Trello importer in Atlassian Jira before version 7.6.1 allows
remote attackers to access the content of internal network resources
via a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). When running in an
environment like Amazon EC2, this flaw maybe used to access to a
metadata resource that provides access credentials and other
potentially confidential information.
