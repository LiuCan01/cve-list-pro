A vulnerability in the implementation of Protected Extensible
Authentication Protocol (PEAP) functionality for standalone
configurations of Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access
Points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass
authentication and connect to an affected device. The vulnerability
exists because the affected device uses an incorrect default
configuration setting of fail open when running in standalone mode. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to
an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
bypass authentication and connect to the affected device. This
vulnerability affects Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access
Points that are running a vulnerable software release and use WLAN
configuration settings that include FlexConnect local switching and
central authentication with MAC filtering. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd46314.
