On Windows installations of the mcollective-puppet-agent plugin,
version 1.12.0, a non-administrator user can create an executable that
will be executed with administrator privileges on the next "mco
puppet" run. Puppet Enterprise users are not affected. This is
resolved in mcollective-puppet-agent 1.12.1.
