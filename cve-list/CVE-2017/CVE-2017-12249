A vulnerability in the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server included
with Cisco Meeting Server (CMS) could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to gain unauthenticated or unauthorized access to components
of or sensitive information in an affected system. The vulnerability is
due to an incorrect default configuration of the TURN server, which
could expose internal interfaces and ports on the external interface of
an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
using a TURN server to perform an unauthorized connection to a Call
Bridge, a Web Bridge, or a database cluster in an affected system,
depending on the deployment model and CMS services in use. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access to a
Call Bridge or database cluster in an affected system or gain
unauthorized access to sensitive meeting information in an affected
system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid
credentials for the TURN server of the affected system. This
vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server (CMS) deployments that are
running a CMS Software release prior to Release 2.0.16, 2.1.11, or
2.2.6. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf51127.
