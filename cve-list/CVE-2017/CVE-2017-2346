An MS-MPC or MS-MIC Service PIC may crash when large fragmented
packets are passed through an Application Layer Gateway (ALG).
Repeated crashes of the Service PC can result in an extended denial of
service condition. The issue can be seen only if NAT or
stateful-firewall rules are configured with ALGs enabled. This issue
was caused by the code change for PR 1182910 in Junos OS 14.1X55-D30,
14.1X55-D35, 14.2R7, 15.1R5, and 16.1R2. No other versions of Junos OS
and no other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by
this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX
platforms running: 14.1X55 from 14.1X55-D30 to releases prior to
14.1X55-D35; 14.2R from 14.2R7 to releases prior to 14.2R7-S4, 14.2R8;
15.1R from 15.1R5 to releases prior to 15.1R5-S2, 15.1R6; 16.1R from
16.1R2 to releases prior to 16.1R3-S2, 16.1R4.
