A race condition during Jenkins 2.81 through 2.94 (inclusive); 2.89.1
startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands
during initialization. This could in rare cases result in failure to
initialize the setup wizard on the first startup. This resulted in
multiple security-related settings not being set to their usual strict
default.
