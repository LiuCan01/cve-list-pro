GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 is vulnerable to a memory information disclosure
vulnerability found in the DescribeImage function of the
magick/describe.c file, because of a heap-based buffer over-read. The
portion of the code containing the vulnerability is responsible for
printing the IPTC Profile information contained in the image. This
vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted MIFF file.
There is an out-of-bounds buffer dereference because certain increments
are never checked.
