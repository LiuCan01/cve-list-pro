Downstream version 1.0.46-1 of pure-ftpd as shipped in Fedora was
vulnerable to packaging error due to which the original configuration
was ignored after update and service started running with default
configuration. This has security implications because of overriding
security-related configuration. This issue doesn't affect upstream
version of pure-ftpd.
