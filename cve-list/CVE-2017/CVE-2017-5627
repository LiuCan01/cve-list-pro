An issue was discovered in Artifex Software, Inc. MuJS before
4006739a28367c708dea19aeb19b8a1a9326ce08. The jsR_setproperty function
in jsrun.c lacks a check for a negative array length. This leads to an
integer overflow in the js_pushstring function in jsrun.c when parsing
a specially crafted JS file.
