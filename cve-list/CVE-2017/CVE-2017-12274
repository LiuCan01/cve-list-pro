A vulnerability in Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) ingress
frame processing for the Cisco Aironet 1560, 2800, and 3800 Series
Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, Layer 2 radio frequency
(RF) adjacent attacker to cause the Access Point (AP) to reload,
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is
due to insufficient validation of the EAP frame. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed EAP frame to the
targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
the AP to reload, resulting in a DoS condition while the AP is
reloading. It may be necessary to manually power cycle the device in
order for it to recover. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco
products running either the Lightweight AP Software or Mobility Express
image: Aironet 1560 Series Access Points, Aironet 2800 Series Access
Points, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points. Note: The Cisco Aironet 1560
Series Access Point device is supported as of release 8.3.112.0. Cisco
Bug IDs: CSCve18935.
