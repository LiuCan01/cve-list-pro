An issue was discovered on Miele Professional PST10 devices. The
corresponding embedded webserver "PST10 WebServer" typically listens
to port 80 and is prone to a directory traversal attack; therefore, an
unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue to access
sensitive information to aide in subsequent attacks. A Proof of
Concept is GET /../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow
HTTP/1.1. This affects PG8527 devices 2.02 before 2.12, PG8527 devices
2.51 before 2.61, PG8527 devices 2.52 before 2.62, PG8527 devices 2.54
before 2.64, PG8528 devices 2.02 before 2.12, PG8528 devices 2.51
before 2.61, PG8528 devices 2.52 before 2.62, PG8528 devices 2.54
before 2.64, PG8535 devices 1.00 before 1.10, PG8535 devices 1.04
