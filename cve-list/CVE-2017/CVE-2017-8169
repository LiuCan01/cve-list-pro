Huawei smart phones with software earlier than VIE-L09C40B360 versions
have a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of parameter
validation. An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious APP
which has the root privilege; the APP can send a specific parameter to
the smart phone, causing the smartphone restart or arbitrary code
execution.
