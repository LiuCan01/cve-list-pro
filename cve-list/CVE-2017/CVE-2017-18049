In the CSV export feature of SilverStripe before 3.5.6, 3.6.x before
3.6.3, and 4.x before 4.0.1, it's possible for the output to contain
macros and scripts, which may be executed if imported without
sanitization into common software (including Microsoft Excel). For
example, the CSV data may contain untrusted user input from the "First
Name" field of a user's /myprofile page.
