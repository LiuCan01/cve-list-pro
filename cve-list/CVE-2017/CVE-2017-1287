IBM Rhapsody DM 5.0 and 6.0 could allow a remote attacker to conduct
phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a
victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a
user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This
could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or
conduct further attacks against the victim.
