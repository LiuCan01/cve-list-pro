An off-by-one error was discovered in
opj_tcd_code_block_enc_allocate_data in lib/openjp2/tcd.c in OpenJPEG
2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write, which may lead
to remote denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow affecting
opj_mqc_flush in lib/openjp2/mqc.c and opj_t1_encode_cblk in
lib/openjp2/t1.c) or possibly remote code execution.
