** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. By sniffing for specific packets on the localhost, plaintext
passwords can be obtained as they are typed into Sunny Explorer by the
user. These passwords can then be used to compromise the overall
device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation likelihood is low
because these packets are usually sent only once during installation.
Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and
TL-30 could potentially be affected.
