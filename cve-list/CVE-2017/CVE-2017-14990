WordPress 4.8.2 stores cleartext wp_signups.activation_key values (but
stores the analogous wp_users.user_activation_key values as hashes),
which might make it easier for remote attackers to hijack unactivated
user accounts by leveraging database read access (such as access gained
through an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability).
