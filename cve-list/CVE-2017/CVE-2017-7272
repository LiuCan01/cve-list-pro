PHP through 7.1.3 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an
fsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is
constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use
the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of
the port number in the second argument of the function.
