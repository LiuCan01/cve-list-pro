Use-after-free in the usbtv_probe function in
drivers/media/usb/usbtv/usbtv-core.c in the Linux kernel through
4.14.10 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering failure of audio
registration, because a kfree of the usbtv data structure occurs during
a usbtv_video_free call, but the usbtv_video_fail label's code attempts
to both access and free this data structure.
