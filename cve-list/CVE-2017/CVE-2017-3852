A vulnerability in the Cisco application-hosting framework (CAF)
component of the Cisco IOx application environment could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to write or modify arbitrary files in
the virtual instance running on the affected device. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied application
packages. An attacker who can upload a malicious package within Cisco
IOx could exploit the vulnerability to modify arbitrary files. The
impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual
instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx. Cisco
IOx Releases 1.0.0.0 and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCuy52317.
