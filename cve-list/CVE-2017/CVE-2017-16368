An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and
earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355
and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This
vulnerability leads to a stack-based buffer overflow condition in the
internal Unicode string manipulation module. It is triggered by an
invalid PDF file, where a crafted Unicode string causes an out of
bounds memory access of a stack allocated buffer, due to improper
checks when manipulating an offset of a pointer to the buffer.
Attackers can exploit the vulnerability and achieve arbitrary code
execution if they can effectively control the accessible memory.
