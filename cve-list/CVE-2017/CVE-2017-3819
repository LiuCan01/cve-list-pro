A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH)
subsystem in the StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series, ASR
5500 Series, ASR 5700 Series devices, and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core
could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unrestricted,
root shell access. The vulnerability is due to missing input validation
of parameters passed during SSH or SFTP login. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted user input to the SSH
or SFTP command-line interface (CLI) during SSH or SFTP login. An
exploit could allow an authenticated attacker to gain root privileges
access on the router. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected
system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability
can be triggered via both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An established TCP
connection toward port 22, the SSH default port, is needed to perform
the attack. The attacker must have valid credentials to login to the
system via SSH or SFTP. The following products have been confirmed to
be vulnerable: Cisco ASR 5000/5500/5700 Series devices running StarOS
after 17.7.0 and prior to 18.7.4, 19.5, and 20.2.3 with SSH configured
are vulnerable. Cisco Virtualized Packet Core - Single Instance
(VPC-SI) and Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) devices running StarOS prior
to N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) and N4.7 (20.2.v0) with SSH configured are
vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva65853.
