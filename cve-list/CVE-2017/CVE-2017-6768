A vulnerability in the build procedure for certain executable system
files installed at boot time on Cisco Application Policy
Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices could allow an authenticated,
local attacker to gain root-level privileges. The vulnerability is due
to a custom executable system file that was built to use relative
search paths for libraries without properly validating the library to
be loaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
authenticating to the device and loading a malicious library that can
escalate the privilege level. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full control of the
device. The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the
device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc96087. Known Affected Releases:
1.1(0.920a), 1.1(1j), 1.1(3f); 1.2 Base, 1.2(2), 1.2(3), 1.2.2;
1.3(1), 1.3(2), 1.3(2f); 2.0 Base, 2.0(1).
