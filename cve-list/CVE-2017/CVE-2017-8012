In EMC ViPR SRM, Storage M&R, VNX M&R, and M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS
Solution Packs, the Java Management Extensions (JMX) protocol used to
communicate between components in the Alerting and/or Compliance
components can be leveraged to create a denial of service (DoS)
condition. Attackers with knowledge of JMX agent user credentials could
potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary files on the
affected system and create a DoS condition by leveraging inherent JMX
protocol capabilities.
