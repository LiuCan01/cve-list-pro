An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3. In the
device's web interface, there is a page that allows an attacker to use
an unsanitized GET parameter to download files from the device as the
root user. The attacker can download any file from the device's
filesystem. This can be used to view unsalted, MD5-hashed administrator
passwords, which can then be cracked, giving the attacker full admin
access to the device's web interface. This vulnerability can also be
used to view the plaintext pre-shared key (PSK) for encrypted wireless
connections, or to view the device's serial number (which allows an
attacker to factory reset the device).
