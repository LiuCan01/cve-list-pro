A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP)
processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected
device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster
Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and
command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to
the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of
CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications
between cluster members and instead accept and process such options
over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the
incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed
CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with
an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An
exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain
full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.
This affects Catalyst switches, Embedded Service 2020 switches,
Enhanced Layer 2 EtherSwitch Service Module, Enhanced Layer 2/3
EtherSwitch Service Module, Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module (CGESM) for
HP, IE Industrial Ethernet switches, ME 4924-10GE switch, RF Gateway
10, and SM-X Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvd48893.
