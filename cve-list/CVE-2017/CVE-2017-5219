An issue was discovered in SageCRM 7.x before 7.3 SP3. The Component
Manager functionality, provided by SageCRM, permits additional
components to be added to the application to enhance provided
functionality. This functionality allows a zip file to be uploaded,
containing a valid .ecf component file, which will be extracted to the
inf directory outside of the webroot. By creating a zip file containing
an empty .ecf file, to pass file-validation checks, any other file
provided in zip file will be extracted onto the filesystem. In this
case, a web shell with the filename
'..WWWRootCustomPagesaspshell.asp' was included within the zip file
that, when extracted, traversed back out of the inf directory and into
the SageCRM webroot. This permitted remote interaction with the
underlying filesystem with the highest privilege level, SYSTEM.
