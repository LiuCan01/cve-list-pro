Enterprise 9.9.16, and Disk Pulse Enterprise 9.9.16 where an attacker
can craft a malicious GET request and exploit the web server

attacker to gain complete access to the system with NT AUTHORITY /
SYSTEM level privileges. The vulnerability lies due to improper
handling and sanitization of the incoming request.
