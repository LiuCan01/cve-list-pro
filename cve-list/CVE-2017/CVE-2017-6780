A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process for Cisco IoT Field
Network Director (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause the system to consume additional memory, eventually
forcing the device to restart, aka Memory Exhaustion. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient rate-limiting protection. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of TCP packets to a
specific group of open listening ports on a targeted device. An exploit
could allow the attacker to cause the system to consume additional
memory. If enough available memory is consumed, the system will
restart, creating a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition. The
DoS condition will end after the device has finished the restart
process. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products:
Connected Grid Network Management System, if running a software release
prior to IoT-FND Release 4.0; IoT Field Network Director, if running a
software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.0. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc77164.
