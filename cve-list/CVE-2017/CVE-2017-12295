A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data about the
application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain
information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The
vulnerability is due to the HTTP header reply from the Cisco WebEx
Meetings Server to the client, which could include internal network
information that should be restricted. An attacker could exploit the
vulnerability by attempting to use the HTTP protocol and looking at the
data in the HTTP responses from the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server. An
exploit could allow the attacker to discover sensitive data about the
application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve65818.
