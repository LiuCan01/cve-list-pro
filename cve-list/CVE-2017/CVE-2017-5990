An issue was discovered in PhreeBooksERP before 2017-02-13. The
vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied
data in the "form" HTTP GET parameter passed to the
"PhreeBooksERP-master/extensions/ShippingMethods/ups/label_mgr/js_include.php"
and
"PhreeBooksERP-master/extensions/ShippingMethods/yrc/label_mgr/js_include.php"
URLs. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website. NOTE: these
js_include.php files do not exist in the SourceForge "stable release"
(aka R37RC1).
