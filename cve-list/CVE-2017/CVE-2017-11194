Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has Reflected XSS in
adminservercacertdetails.cgi. In the admin panel, the certid parameter
of adminservercacertdetails.cgi is reflected in the application's

tags. An attacker could come up with clever payloads to make the system
run commands such as ping, ping6, traceroute, nslookup, arp, etc.
