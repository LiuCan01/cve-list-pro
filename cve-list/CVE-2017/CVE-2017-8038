In Cloud Foundry Foundation Credhub-release version 1.1.0, access
control lists (ACLs) enforce whether an authenticated user can perform
an operation on a credential. For installations using ACLs, the ACL was
bypassed for the CredHub interpolate endpoint, allowing authenticated
applications to view any credential within the CredHub installation.
