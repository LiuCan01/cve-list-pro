It was found that under some situations and configurations of Apache
Storm 1.x before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1, it is theoretically
possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch
a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case this could
lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised.
