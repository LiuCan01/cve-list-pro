Node.js v4.0 through v4.8.3, all versions of v5.x, v6.0 through
v6.11.0, v7.0 through v7.10.0, and v8.0 through v8.1.3 was susceptible
to hash flooding remote DoS attacks as the HashTable seed was constant
across a given released version of Node.js. This was a result of
building with V8 snapshots enabled by default which caused the
initially randomized seed to be overwritten on startup.
