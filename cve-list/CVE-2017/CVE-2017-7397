** DISPUTED ** BackBox Linux 4.6 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (ksoftirqd CPU consumption) via a flood of packets
with Martian source IP addresses (as defined in RFC 1812 section
5.3.7). This product enables net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians by
default.  NOTE: the vendor reports "It has been proved that this
vulnerability has no foundation and it is totally fake and based on
false assumptions."
