The Reporting Compatibility Add On before 2.0.4 for OpenMRS, as
distributed in OpenMRS Reference Application before 2.6.1, does not
authenticate users when deserializing XML input into ReportSchema
objects. The result is that remote unauthenticated users are able to
execute operating system commands by crafting malicious XML payloads,
as demonstrated by a single admin/reports/reportSchemaXml.form request.
