A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Jabber
Guest Server 10.6(9), 11.0(0), and 11.0(1) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of
the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface
of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access
sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve09718.
