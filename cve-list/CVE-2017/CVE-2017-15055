TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce item access control
when requesting items.queries.php. It is then possible to copy any
arbitrary item into a directory controlled by the attacker, edit any
item within a read-only directory, delete an arbitrary item, delete the
file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy the password of an
arbitrary item to the copy/paste buffer, access the history of an
arbitrary item, and edit attributes of an arbitrary directory. To
exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must tamper with
the requests sent directly, for example by changing the "item_id"
parameter when invoking "copy_item" on items.queries.php.
