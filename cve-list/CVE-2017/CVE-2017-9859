** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. The inverters make use of a weak hashing algorithm to
encrypt the password for REGISTER requests. This hashing algorithm can
be cracked relatively easily. An attacker will likely be able to crack
the password using offline crackers. This cracked password can then be
used to register at the SMA servers. NOTE: the vendor's position is
that "we consider the probability of the success of such manipulation
to be extremely low." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny
Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
