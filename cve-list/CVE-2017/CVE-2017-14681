Phase: Assigned (20170921)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://sourceforge.net/p/p3scan/bugs/33/

The daemon in P3Scan 3.0_rc1 and earlier creates a p3scan.pid file
after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow
local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this
non-root account for p3scan.pid modification before a root script
executes a "kill `cat /pathname/p3scan.pid`" command, as demonstrated
by etc/init.d/p3scan.
