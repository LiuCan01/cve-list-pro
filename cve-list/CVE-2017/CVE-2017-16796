Reference: MISC:https://github.com/matthiaskramm/swftools/issues/51

In SWFTools 0.9.2, the png_load function in lib/png.c does not check
the return value of a realloc call, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (invalid write and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving an IDAT
tag in a crafted PNG file.
