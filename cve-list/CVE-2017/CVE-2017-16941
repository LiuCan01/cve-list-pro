** DISPUTED ** October CMS through 1.0.428 does not prevent use of
.htaccess in themes, which allows remote authenticated users to execute
arbitrary PHP code by downloading a theme ZIP archive from
/backend/cms/themes, and then uploading and importing a modified
archive with two new files: a .php file and a .htaccess file. NOTE: the
vendor says "I don't think [an attacker able to login to the system
under an account that has access to manage/upload themes] is a threat
model that we need to be considering."
