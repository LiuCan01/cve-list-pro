Bamboo did not check that the name of a branch in a Mercurial
repository contained argument parameters. An attacker who has
permission to create a repository in Bamboo, edit an existing plan
that has a non-linked Mercurialrepository, create or edit a plan when
there is at least one linked Mercurial repository that the attacker
has permission to use, or commit to a Mercurial repository used by a
Bamboo plan which has branch detection enabled can execute code of
their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo
Server. Versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.1.6 (the fixed
version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for
6.2.x) are affected by this vulnerability.
