An issue has been discovered on the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon
Security Appliance before 03.2.00. An incomplete firmware signature
allows a local attacker to upgrade the equipment (kernel, file system)
with unsigned, attacker-controlled, data. This occurs because the
appliance_config file is signed but the .tar.sec file is unsigned.
