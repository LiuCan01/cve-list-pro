In Youngzsoft CCFile (aka CC File Transfer) 3.6, by sending a crafted
HTTP request, it is possible for a malicious user to remotely crash the
affected software. No authentication is required. An example payload is
a malformed request header with many '|' characters. NOTE: some sources
use this ID for a NoviWare issue, but the correct ID for that issue is
CVE-2017-12787.
