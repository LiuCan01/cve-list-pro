** DISPUTED ** Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not
validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER
environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software
maintainer indicates that exploitation is impossible because the code
relies on subprocess.Popen and the default shell=False setting.
