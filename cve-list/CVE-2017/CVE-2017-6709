A vulnerability in the AutoVNF tool for the Cisco Ultra Services
Framework could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access
administrative credentials for Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC)
and Cisco OpenStack deployments in an affected system. The
vulnerability exists because the affected software logs administrative
credentials in clear text for Cisco ESC and Cisco OpenStack deployment
purposes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the
AutoVNF URL for the location where the log files are stored and
subsequently accessing the administrative credentials that are stored
in clear text in those log files. This vulnerability affects all
releases of the Cisco Ultra Services Framework prior to Releases 5.0.3
and 5.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76659.
