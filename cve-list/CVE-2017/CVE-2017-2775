An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the
LvVariantUnflatten functionality in 64-bit versions of LabVIEW before
2015 SP1 f7 Patch and 2016 before f2 Patch. A specially crafted VI
file can cause a user controlled value to be used as a loop terminator
resulting in internal heap corruption. An attacker controlled VI file
can be used to trigger this vulnerability, exploitation could lead to
remote code execution.
