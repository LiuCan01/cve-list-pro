Integer overflow in the soap_get function in Genivia gSOAP 2.7.x and
2.8.x before 2.8.48, as used on Axis cameras and other devices, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a large XML
document, aka Devil's Ivy. NOTE: the large document would be blocked by
many common web-server configurations on general-purpose computers.
