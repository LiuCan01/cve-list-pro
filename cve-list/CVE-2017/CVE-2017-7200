An SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The
'copy_from' feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to
perform masked network port scans. With v1, it is possible to create
images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could then allow
an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing
masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image
service.
