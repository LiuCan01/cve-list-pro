In the mboxlist_do_find function in imap/mboxlist.c in Cyrus IMAP
before 3.0.4, an off-by-one error in prefix calculation for the LIST
command caused use of uninitialized memory, which might allow remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
(daemon crash) via a 'LIST "" "Other Users"' command.
