The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1
because the existing reloc offset range tests didn't catch small
negative offsets less than the size of the reloc field. This
vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary
programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.
