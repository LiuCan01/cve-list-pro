Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 10.5 before Build 65.11,
11.0 before Build 69.12/69.123, and 11.1 before Build 51.21 randomly
generates GCM nonces, which makes it marginally easier for remote
attackers to obtain the GCM authentication key and spoof data by
leveraging a reused nonce in a session and a "forbidden attack," a
similar issue to CVE-2016-0270.
