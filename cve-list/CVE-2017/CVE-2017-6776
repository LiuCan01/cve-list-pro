A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Elastic Services
Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web
interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious
link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code
into the request. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the
attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvd76324. Known Affected Releases: 2.2(9.76) and 2.3(1).
