concrete5 8.1.0 places incorrect trust in the HTTP Host header during
caching, if the administrator did not define a "canonical" URL on
installation of concrete5 using the "Advanced Options" settings. Remote
attackers can make a GET request with any domain name in the Host
header; this is stored and allows for arbitrary domains to be set for
certain links displayed to subsequent visitors, potentially an XSS
vector.
