A vulnerability in the web-based UI of Cisco Unified Communications
Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a
cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack. The vulnerability exists because
the affected software does not provide sufficient protections for HTML
inline frames (iframes). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by directing a user of the affected software to an attacker-controlled
web page that contains a malicious HTML inline frame. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to conduct click-jacking or other
types of client-side browser attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve60993.
