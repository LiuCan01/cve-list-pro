Reference: MLIST:[www-announce] 20170918 CVE-2017-9803: Security vulnerability in kerberos delegation token functionality

Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens,
which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user
or another application. There are two issues with this functionality
(when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g.
SaslZkACLProvider). Firstly, access to the security configuration can
be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious
users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation
to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the
Solr cluster. The vulnerability is fixed from Solr 6.6.1 onwards.
