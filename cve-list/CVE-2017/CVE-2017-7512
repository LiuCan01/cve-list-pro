Red Hat 3scale (aka RH-3scale) API Management Platform (AMP) before
2.0.0 would permit creation of an access token without a client secret.
An attacker could use this flaw to circumvent authentication controls
and gain access to restricted APIs. NOTE: some sources have a typo in
which CVE-2017-7512 maps to an OpenVPN vulnerability. The proper CVE ID
for that OpenVPN vulnerability is CVE-2017-7521. Specifically,
CVE-2017-7521 is the correct CVE ID for TWO closely related findings in
OpenVPN. Any source that lists BOTH CVE-2017-7512 and CVE-2017-7521 for
OpenVPN should have listed ONLY CVE-2017-7521.
