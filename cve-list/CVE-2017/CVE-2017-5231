All editions of Rapid7 Metasploit prior to version 4.13.0-2017020701
contain a directory traversal vulnerability in the Meterpreter stdapi
CommandDispatcher.cmd_download() function. By using a
specially-crafted build of Meterpreter, it is possible to write to an
arbitrary directory on the Metasploit console with the permissions of
the running Metasploit instance.
