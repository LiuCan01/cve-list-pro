In Wireshark 2.2.4 and earlier, a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607
capture file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the
packet size field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from
will not advance, causing continuous attempts to read the same zero
length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system memory.
