GSTN_offline_tool in India Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN)
Offline Utility tool before 1.2 executes winstart-server.vbs from the
"C:GST Offline Tool" directory, which has insecure permissions. This
allows local users to gain privileges by replacing winstart-server.vbs
with arbitrary VBScript code. For example, a local user could create
VBScript code for a TCP reverse shell, and use that later for Remote
Command Execution.
