Atlassian Bamboo 5.x before 5.15.7 and 6.x before 6.0.1 did not
correctly check if a user creating a deployment project had the edit
permission and therefore the rights to do so.  An attacker who can
login to Bamboo as a user without the edit permission for deployment
projects is able to use this vulnerability, provided there is an
existing plan with a green build, to create a deployment project and
execute arbitrary code on an available Bamboo Agent.  By default a
local agent is enabled; this means that code execution can occur on
the system hosting Bamboo as the user running Bamboo.
