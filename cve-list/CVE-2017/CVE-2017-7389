Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in 'openeclass
Release_3.5.4'. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient
filtration of user-supplied data (meeting_id, user) passed to the
'openeclass-master/modules/tc/webconf/webconf.php' URL. An attacker
could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the
context of the vulnerable website.
