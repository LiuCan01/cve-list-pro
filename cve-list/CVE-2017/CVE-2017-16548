The receive_xattr function in xattrs.c in rsync 3.1.2 and
3.1.3-development does not check for a trailing '0' character in an
xattr name, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact by sending crafted data to the daemon.
