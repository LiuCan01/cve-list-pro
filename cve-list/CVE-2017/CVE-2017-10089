Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE
(subcomponent: ImageIO). Supported versions that are affected are Java
SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows
unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from
a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in
Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of
Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code
installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.6
(Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
