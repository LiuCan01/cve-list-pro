A vulnerability in the handling of 802.11w Protected Management Frames
(PAF) by Cisco Aironet 3800 Series Access Points could allow an
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to terminate a valid user connection
to an affected device, aka Denial of Service. The vulnerability exists
because the affected device does not properly validate 802.11w PAF
disassociation and deauthentication frames that it receives. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed 802.11w
PAF frame from a valid, authenticated client on an adjacent network to
an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
terminate a single valid user connection to the affected device. This
vulnerability affects Access Points that are configured to run in
FlexConnect mode. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc20627.
