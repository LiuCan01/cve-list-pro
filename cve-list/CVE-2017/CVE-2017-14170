In libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in
mxf_read_index_entry_array() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check
might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted MXF file, which claims
a large "nb_index_entries" field in the header but does not contain
sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop would consume huge CPU
resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop. Moreover, this
big loop can be invoked multiple times if there is more than one
applicable data segment in the crafted MXF file.
