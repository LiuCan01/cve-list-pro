A vulnerability in the detection engine parsing of IPv6 packets for
Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause high CPU utilization or to cause a denial of service
(DoS) condition because the Snort process restarts unexpectedly. The
vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the fields in the
IPv6 extension header packet. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a malicious IPv6 packet to the detection
engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic
inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped. This vulnerability is
specific to IPv6 traffic only. This vulnerability affects Cisco
