Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.1.5

The "OpenID Connect Relying Party and OAuth 2.0 Resource Server" (aka
mod_auth_openidc) module before 2.1.5 for the Apache HTTP Server does
not skip OIDC_CLAIM_ and OIDCAuthNHeader headers in an
"OIDCUnAuthAction pass" configuration, which allows remote attackers to
bypass authentication via crafted HTTP traffic.
