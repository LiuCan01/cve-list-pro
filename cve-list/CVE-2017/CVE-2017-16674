Datto Windows Agent allows unauthenticated remote command execution via
a modified command in conjunction with CVE-2017-16673 exploitation, aka
an attack with a malformed primary whitelisted command and a secondary
non-whitelisted command. This affects Datto Windows Agent (DWA) 1.0.5.0
and earlier. In other words, an attacker could combine this
"primary/secondary" attack with the CVE-2017-16673 "rogue pairing"
attack to achieve unauthenticated access to all agent machines running
these older DWA versions.
