A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Google Chrome and
Mozilla Firefox could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser on
an affected system. This vulnerability affects the browser extensions
for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center,
Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center), and Cisco WebEx
Meetings when they are running on Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability
is due to a design defect in the extension. An attacker who can
convince an affected user to visit an attacker-controlled web page or
follow an attacker-supplied link with an affected browser could exploit
the vulnerability. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected browser. The following
versions of the Cisco WebEx browser extensions are affected: Versions
prior to 1.0.12 of the Cisco WebEx extension on Google Chrome, Versions
prior to 1.0.12 of the Cisco WebEx extension on Mozilla Firefox. Cisco
