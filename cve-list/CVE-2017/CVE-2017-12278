A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to restart,
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is
due to a memory leak that occurs on an affected device after the device
fails to deallocate a buffer that is used when certain MIBs are polled.
An attacker who knows the SNMP Version 2 SNMP Read string or has valid
SNMP Version 3 credentials for an affected device could repeatedly poll
the affected MIB object IDs (OIDs) and consume available memory on the
device. When memory is sufficiently depleted on the device, the device
will restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc71674.
