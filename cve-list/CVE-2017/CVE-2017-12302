A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager SQL
database interface could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
impact the confidentiality of the system by executing arbitrary SQL
queries, aka SQL Injection. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input
validation on user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain
malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow
the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the
database. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf36682.
