Huawei smart phones with software earlier than Vicky-AL00AC00B172D
versions have a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass security
vulnerability. When re-configuring the mobile phone using the factory
reset protection (FRP) function, an attacker can login the Talkback
mode and can perform some operations to bypass the Google account
verification. As a result, the FRP function is bypassed.
