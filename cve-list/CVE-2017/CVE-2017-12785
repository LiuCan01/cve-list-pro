The novish command-line interface, included in the NoviWare software
distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on NoviSwitch devices, is
prone to a buffer overflow in the "show log cli" command. This could be
used by a read-only user (monitor role) to gain privileged (root) code
execution on the switch via command injection.
