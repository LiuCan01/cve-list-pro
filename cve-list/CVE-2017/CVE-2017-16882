Phase: Assigned (20171118)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-core/issues/1601

Icinga Core through 1.14.0 initially executes bin/icinga as root but
supports configuration options in which this file is owned by a
non-root account (and similarly can have etc/icinga.cfg owned by a
non-root account), which allows local users to gain privileges by
leveraging access to this non-root account, a related issue to
CVE-2017-14312. This also affects bin/icingastats, bin/ido2db, and
bin/log2ido.
