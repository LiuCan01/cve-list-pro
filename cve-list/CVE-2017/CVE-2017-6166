In BIG-IP LTM, AAM, AFM, Analytics, APM, ASM, DNS, Link Controller,
PEM, and WebSafe software 12.0.0 to 12.1.1, in some cases the Traffic
Management Microkernel (TMM) may crash when processing fragmented
packets. This vulnerability affects TMM through a virtual server
configured with a FastL4 profile. Traffic processing is disrupted
while TMM restarts. If the affected BIG-IP system is configured as
part of a device group, it will trigger a failover to the peer device.
