BigTree CMS through 4.2.17 relies on a substring check for CSRF
protection, which allows remote attackers to bypass this check by
placing the required admin/developer/ URI within a query string in an
HTTP Referer header. This was found in
core/admin/modules/developer/_header.php and patched in
core/inc/bigtree/admin.php on 2017-04-14.
