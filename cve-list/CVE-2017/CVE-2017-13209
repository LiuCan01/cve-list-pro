In the ServiceManager::add function in the hardware service manager,
there is an insecure permissions check based on the PID of the caller
which could allow an application or service to replace a HAL service
with its own service. This could lead to a local elevation of
privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no
additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: 8.0, 8.1. Android ID:
A-68217907.
