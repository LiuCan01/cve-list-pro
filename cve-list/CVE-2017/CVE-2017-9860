** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network
protocol to update the device firmware without ever having to
authenticate. If an attacker is able to create a custom firmware
version that is accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised
completely. This allows the attacker to do nearly anything: for
example, giving access to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the
inverters as a stepping stone into companies, etc. NOTE: the vendor
reports that this attack has always been blocked by "a final integrity
and compatibility check." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and
Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
