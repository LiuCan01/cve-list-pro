elf/dl-load.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.19 through
2.26 mishandles RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for a privileged
(setuid or AT_SECURE) program, which allows local users to gain
privileges via a Trojan horse library in the current working directory,
related to the fillin_rpath and decompose_rpath functions. This is
associated with misinterpretion of an empty RPATH/RUNPATH token as the
"./" directory. NOTE: this configuration of RPATH/RUNPATH for a
privileged program is apparently very uncommon; most likely, no such
program is shipped with any common Linux distribution.
