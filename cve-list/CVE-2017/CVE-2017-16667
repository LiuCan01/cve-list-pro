backintime (aka Back in Time) before 1.1.24 did improper
escaping/quoting of file paths used as arguments to the 'notify-send'
command, leading to some parts of file paths being executed as shell
commands within an os.system call in qt4/plugins/notifyplugin.py. This
could allow an attacker to craft an unreadable file with a specific
name to run arbitrary shell commands.
