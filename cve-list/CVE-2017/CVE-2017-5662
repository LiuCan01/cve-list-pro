In Apache Batik before 1.9, files lying on the filesystem of the
server which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send
maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend
on the user context in which the exploitable application is running.
If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including
confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be
used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as
the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an
amplification attack.
