A vulnerability in the DNS input packet processor for Cisco Prime
Network Registrar could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause the DNS process to momentarily restart, which could lead to a
partial denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected system. The
vulnerability is due to incomplete DNS packet header validation when
the packet is received by the application. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending a malformed DNS packet to the
application. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DNS
process to restart, which could lead to a DoS condition. This
vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Network Registrar on all software
versions prior to 8.3.5. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb55412.
