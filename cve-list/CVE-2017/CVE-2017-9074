The IPv6 fragmentation implementation in the Linux kernel through
4.11.1 does not consider that the nexthdr field may be associated with
an invalid option, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read and BUG) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via crafted socket and send system calls.
