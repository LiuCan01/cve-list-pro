The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
in GNU Binutils 2.28, has an aout_link_add_symbols function in
bfd/aoutx.h that is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer over-read
(off-by-one) because of an incomplete check for invalid string offsets
while loading symbols, leading to a GNU linker (ld) program crash.
