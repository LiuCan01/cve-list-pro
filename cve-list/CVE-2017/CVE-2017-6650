A vulnerability in the Telnet CLI command of Cisco NX-OS System
Software 7.1 through 7.3 running on Cisco Nexus Series Switches could
allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection
attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of
command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
injecting crafted command arguments into the Telnet CLI command. An
exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files at
the user's privilege level outside of the user's path. Cisco Bug IDs:
