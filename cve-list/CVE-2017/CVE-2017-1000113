The Deploy to container Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of
its configuration. This allowed users with Jenkins master local file
system access, or users with Extended Read access to the jobs it is
used in, to retrieve those passwords. The Deploy to container Plugin
now integrates with Credentials Plugin to store passwords securely,
and automatically migrates existing passwords.
