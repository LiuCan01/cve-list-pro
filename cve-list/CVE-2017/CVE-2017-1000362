Name: CVE-2017-1000362
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000362
Phase: Assigned (20170710)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/

The re-key admin monitor was introduced in Jenkins 1.498 and
re-encrypted all secrets in JENKINS_HOME with a new key. It also
created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to
encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed
afterwards. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present.
Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory.
Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually
created backups are advised to check them for the directory
$JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and
delete it if present.
