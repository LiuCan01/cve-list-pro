opcodes/i386-dis.c in GNU Binutils 2.28 does not consider the number of
registers for bnd mode, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by
mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
