An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the image
rendering functionality of Poppler 0.53.0. A specifically crafted pdf
can cause an image resizing after allocation has already occurred,
resulting in heap corruption which can lead to code execution. An
attacker controlled PDF file can be used to trigger this
vulnerability.
