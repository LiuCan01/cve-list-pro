Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser/pull/481

A vulnerability in Swagger-Parser's version <= 1.0.30 and Swagger
codegen version <= 2.2.2 yaml parsing functionality results in
arbitrary code being executed when a maliciously crafted yaml Open-API
specification is parsed. This in particular, affects the 'generate'
and 'validate' command in swagger-codegen (<= 2.2.2) and can lead to
arbitrary code being executed when these commands are used on a
well-crafted yaml specification.
