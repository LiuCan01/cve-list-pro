A vulnerability within the firewall configuration of the Cisco
Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module
(APIC-EM) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain
privileged access to services only available on the internal network of
the device. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect firewall rule on
the device. The misconfiguration could allow traffic sent to the public
interface of the device to be forwarded to the internal virtual network
of the APIC-EM. An attacker that is logically adjacent to the network
on which the public interface of the affected APIC-EM resides could
leverage this behavior to gain access to services listening on the
internal network with elevated privileges. This vulnerability affects
appliances or virtual devices running Cisco Application Policy
Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module prior to version 1.5. Cisco
