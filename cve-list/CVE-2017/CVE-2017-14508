An issue was discovered in SugarCRM before 7.7.2.3, 7.8.x before
7.8.2.2, and 7.9.x before 7.9.2.0 (and Sugar Community Edition 6.5.26).
Several areas have been identified in the Documents and Emails module
that could allow an authenticated user to perform SQL injection, as
demonstrated by a backslash character at the end of a bean_id to
modules/Emails/DetailView.php. An attacker could exploit these
vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SQL request to the affected areas.
An exploit could allow the attacker to modify the SQL database. Proper
SQL escaping has been added to prevent such exploits.
