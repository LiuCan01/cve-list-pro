A vulnerability in the REST API of the web-based user interface (web
UI) of Cisco IOS XE 3.1 through 16.5 could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to bypass authentication to the REST API of the web UI
of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
input validation for the REST API of the affected software. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious API request to
an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
bypass authentication and gain access to the web UI of the affected
software. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a
vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the HTTP Server feature
is enabled for the device. The newly redesigned, web-based
administration UI was introduced in the Denali 16.2 Release of Cisco
IOS XE Software. This vulnerability does not affect the web-based
administration UI in earlier releases of Cisco IOS XE Software. Cisco
