A vulnerability in the HTTP web interface for Cisco Wide Area
Application Services (WAAS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause an HTTP Application Optimization (AO) related process
to restart, causing a partial denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to lack of input validation of user-supplied input
parameters within an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request through the targeted
device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition
due to a process unexpectedly restarting. The WAAS could drop traffic
during the brief time the process is restarting. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvc63048.
