The tcpmss_mangle_packet function in net/netfilter/xt_TCPMSS.c in the
Linux kernel before 4.11, and 4.9.x before 4.9.36, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory
corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the
presence of xt_TCPMSS in an iptables action.
