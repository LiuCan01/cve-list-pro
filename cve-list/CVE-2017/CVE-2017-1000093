Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via
POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
This allowed attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known
name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a
protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the
plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this
functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.
