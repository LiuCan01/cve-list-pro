In BlackBerry QNX Software Development Platform (SDP) 6.6.0 and 6.5.0
SP1 and earlier, a loss of integrity vulnerability in the default
configuration of the QNX SDP could allow an attacker being able to
reduce the entropy of the PRNG, making other blended attacks more
practical by gaining control over environmental factors that influence
seed generation.
