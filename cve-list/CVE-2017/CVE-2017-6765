A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) 9.1(6.11) and 9.4(1.2) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an
affected device, aka WebVPN XSS. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a
crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the
attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve19179.
