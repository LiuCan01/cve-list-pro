Reference: MISC:https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/323

A SQL injection vulnerability in core/inc/auto-modules.php in BigTree
CMS through 4.2.19 allows remote authenticated attackers to obtain
information in the context of the user used by the application to
retrieve data from the database. The attack uses an
admin/trees/add/process request with a crafted _tags[] parameter that
is mishandled in a later admin/ajax/dashboard/approve-change request.
