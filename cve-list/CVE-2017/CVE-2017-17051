An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack
Nova 16.0.3. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an
authenticated user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host
leading to a denial of service, aka doubled resource allocations. This
regression was introduced with the fix for OSSA-2017-005
(CVE-2017-16239); however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments
with that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are
affected.
