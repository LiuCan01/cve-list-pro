Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in OpenEMR
5.0.0 and 5.0.1-dev. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient
filtration of user-supplied data passed to the
"openemr-master/gacl/admin/object_search.php" URL (section_value;
src_form). An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in
a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
