An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa
Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, after
logging in, there is a page that allows you to ping other hosts from
the device and view the results. The user is allowed to specify which
host to ping, but this variable is not sanitized server-side, which
allows an attacker to pass a specially crafted string to execute shell
commands as the root user.
