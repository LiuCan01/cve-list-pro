Reference: MISC:https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.14.11

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in network namespaces code
affecting the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. The function
get_net_ns_by_id() in net/core/net_namespace.c does not check for the
net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr,
which could lead to double free and memory corruption. This
vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to induce kernel
memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature
of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although
it is thought to be unlikely.
