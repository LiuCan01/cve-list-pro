It was found that versions of rpm before 4.13.0.2 use temporary files
with predictable names when installing an RPM. An attacker with
ability to write in a directory where files will be installed could
create symbolic links to an arbitrary location and modify content, and
possibly permissions to arbitrary files, which could be used for
denial of service or possibly privilege escalation.
