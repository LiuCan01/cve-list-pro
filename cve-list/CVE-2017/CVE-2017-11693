MEDHOST Document Management System contains hard-coded credentials that
are used for customer database access. An attacker with knowledge of
the hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate directly with
the database may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and
financial information. PostgreSQL is used as the Document Management
System database. The account name is dms. The password is hard-coded
throughout the application, and is the same across all installations.
Customers do not have the option to change passwords. The dms account
for PostgreSQL has access to the database schema for Document
Management System.
