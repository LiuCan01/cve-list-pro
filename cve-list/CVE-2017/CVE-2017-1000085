Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository
as part of form validation (e.g. to retrieve a list of tags). This
functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with
Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to connect to any web
server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID,
thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did
not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be
performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request
Forgery attacks.
