A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was discovered in ZoneMinder before
1.30.2. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data (postLoginQuery) passed to the
"ZoneMinder-master/web/skins/classic/views/js/postlogin.js.php" URL.
An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser
in the context of the vulnerable website.
