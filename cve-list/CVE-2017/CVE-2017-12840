A kernel driver, namely DLMFENC.sys, bundled with the DESLock+ client
application 4.8.16 and earlier contains a locally exploitable heap
based buffer overflow in the handling of an IOCTL message of type
0x0FA4204. The vulnerability is present due to the kernel driver
failing to allocate sufficient memory on the kernel heap to contain a
user supplied string as such the string is copied into a buffer of
constant size (0x1000-bytes) and thus an overflow condition results.
Access to the kernel driver is permitted through an obfuscated
interface whereby bytes of user supplied message are "authenticated"
via an obfuscation routine employing a linear equation.
