pfSense versions 2.4.1 and lower are vulnerable to clickjacking
attacks in the CSRF error page resulting in privileged execution of
arbitrary code, because the error detection occurs before an
X-Frame-Options header is set. This is fixed in 2.4.2-RELEASE.
OPNsense, a 2015 fork of pfSense, was not vulnerable since version
16.1.16 released on June 06, 2016. The unprotected web form was
removed from the code during an internal security audit under
"possibly insecure" suspicions.
