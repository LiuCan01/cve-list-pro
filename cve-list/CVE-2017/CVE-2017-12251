A vulnerability in the web console of the Cisco Cloud Services Platform
(CSP) 2100 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to interact
maliciously with the services or virtual machines (VMs) operating
remotely on an affected CSP device. The vulnerability is due to
weaknesses in the generation of certain authentication mechanisms in
the URL of the web console. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by browsing to one of the hosted VMs' URLs in Cisco CSP
and viewing specific patterns that control the web application's
mechanisms for authentication control. An exploit could allow the
attacker to access a specific VM on the CSP, which causes a complete
loss of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This
vulnerability affects Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 running
software release 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, or 2.2.2. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCve64690.
