opcodes/rx-decode.opc in GNU Binutils 2.28 lacks bounds checks for
certain scale arrays, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by
mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
