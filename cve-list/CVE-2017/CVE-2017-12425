An issue was discovered in Varnish HTTP Cache 4.0.1 through 4.0.4,
4.1.0 through 4.1.7, 5.0.0, and 5.1.0 through 5.1.2. A wrong if
statement in the varnishd source code means that particular invalid
requests from the client can trigger an assert, related to an Integer
Overflow. This causes the varnishd worker process to abort and restart,
losing the cached contents in the process. An attacker can therefore
crash the varnishd worker process on demand and effectively keep it
from serving content - a Denial-of-Service attack. The specific
source-code filename containing the incorrect statement varies across
releases.
