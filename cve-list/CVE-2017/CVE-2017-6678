A vulnerability in the ingress UDP packet processing functionality of
Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software
19.2 through 21.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause both control function (CF) instances on an affected system to
reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of user-supplied data by
the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted UDP packets to the distributed instance (DI) network
addresses of both CF instances on an affected system. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unhandled error condition
on the affected system, which would cause the CF instances to reload
and consequently cause the entire VPC to reload, resulting in the
disconnection of all subscribers and a DoS condition on the affected
system. This vulnerability can be exploited via IPv4 traffic only.
