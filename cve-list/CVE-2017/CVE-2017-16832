The pe_bfd_read_buildid function in peicode.h in the Binary File
Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
2.29.1, does not validate size and offset values in the data
dictionary, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(segmentation violation and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file.
