** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology
products. If a user simultaneously has Sunny Explorer running and
visits a malicious host, cross-site request forgery can be used to
change settings in the inverters (for example, issuing a POST request
to change the user password). All Sunny Explorer settings available to
the authenticated user are also available to the attacker. (In some
cases, this also includes changing settings that the user has no
access to.) This may result in complete compromise of the device.
NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation is unlikely because Sunny
Explorer is used only rarely. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21
and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
