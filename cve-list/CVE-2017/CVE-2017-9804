In Apache Struts 2.3.7 through 2.3.33 and 2.5 through 2.5.12, if an
application allows entering a URL in a form field and built-in
URLValidator is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which
will be used to overload server process when performing validation of
the URL.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix
for S2-047 / CVE-2017-7672.
