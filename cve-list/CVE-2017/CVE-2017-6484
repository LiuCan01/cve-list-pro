Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/INTER-Mediator/INTER-Mediator/issues/772

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in
INTER-Mediator 5.5. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient
filtration of user-supplied data (c and cred) passed to the
"INTER-Mediator-master/Auth_Support/PasswordReset/resetpassword.php"
URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
