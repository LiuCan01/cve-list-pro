A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality
of the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC)
3.0(1c) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a
valid user session on an affected system. The vulnerability exists
because the affected software does not assign a new session identifier
to a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based GUI. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session
identifier to connect to the software through the web-based GUI. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated
user's browser session on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCvd14583.
