A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) of the Cisco
TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a TelePresence
endpoint to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of flow-control
mechanisms within the software. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a flood of SIP INVITE packets to the affected
device. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact the availability
of services and data of the device, including a complete DoS condition.
This vulnerability affects the following Cisco TC and CE platforms when
running software versions prior to TC 7.3.8 and CE 8.3.0. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCux94002.
