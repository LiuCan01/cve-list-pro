Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE
(subcomponent: Smart Card IO). Supported versions that are affected
are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9. Difficult to exploit
vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require
human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful
attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation,
deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE
accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or
complete access to all Java SE accessible data. Note: This
vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in
servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by
an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.8 (Confidentiality and
Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).
