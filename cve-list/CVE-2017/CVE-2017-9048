libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a stack-based
buffer overflow. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is
supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char
buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. At the end of the routine, the function
may strcat two more characters without checking whether the current
strlen(buf) + 2 < size. This vulnerability causes programs that use
libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.
