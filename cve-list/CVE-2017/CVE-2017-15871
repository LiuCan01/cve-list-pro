** DISPUTED ** The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through
1.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors
involving an Immediately Invoked Function Expression "function()"
substring, as demonstrated by a "function(){console.log(" call or a
simple infinite loop. NOTE: the vendor agrees that denial of service
can occur but notes that deserialize is explicitly listed as "harmful"
within the README.md file.
