This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files
on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager
7.2.730 build 1034. Although authentication is required to exploit
this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be
bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.templates.misc.sample_jsp servlet, which
listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the type parameter,
the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to
using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in
conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context
of Administrator. Was ZDI-CAN-5190.
