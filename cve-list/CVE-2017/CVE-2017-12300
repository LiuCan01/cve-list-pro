A vulnerability in the SNORT detection engine of Cisco Firepower System
Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a
file policy that is configured to block the Server Message Block
Version 2 (SMB2) protocol. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect
detection of an SMB2 file when the detection is based on the length of
the file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted SMB2 transfer request through the targeted device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to bypass filters that are configured
to block SMB2 traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve58398.
