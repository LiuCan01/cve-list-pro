Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin was not requiring requests to
its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request
Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to add administrator role to
any user, or to remove the authorization configuration, preventing
legitimate access to Jenkins.
