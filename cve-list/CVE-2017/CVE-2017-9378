Reference: MISC:https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/282

BigTree CMS through 4.2.18 does not prevent a user from deleting their
own account. This could have security relevance because deletion was
supposed to be an admin-only action, and the admin may have other tasks
(such as data backups) to complete before a user is deleted.
