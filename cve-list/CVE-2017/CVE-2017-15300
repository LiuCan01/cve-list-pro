The miner statistics HTTP API in EWBF Cuda Zcash Miner Version 0.3.4b
hangs on incoming TCP connections until some sort of request is made
(such as "GET / HTTP/1.1"), which allows for a Denial of Service attack
preventing a user from viewing their mining statistics by an attacker
opening a session with telnet or netcat and connecting to the miner on
the HTTP API port.
