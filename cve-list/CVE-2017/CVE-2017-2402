An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. macOS before
10.12.4 is affected. The issue involves mishandling of profile
uninstall actions in the "MCX Client" component when a profile has
multiple payloads. It allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions by leveraging Active Directory certificate trust
that should not have remained.
