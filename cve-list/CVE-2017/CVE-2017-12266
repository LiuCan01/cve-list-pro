A vulnerability in the routine that loads DLL files in Cisco Meeting
App for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run an
executable file with privileges equivalent to those of Cisco Meeting
App. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the
path name for DLL files before they are loaded. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted DLL file in a
specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host
with privileges equivalent to those of Cisco Meeting App. The attacker
would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco
