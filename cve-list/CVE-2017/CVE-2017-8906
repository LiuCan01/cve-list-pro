Reference: MISC:https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265/issues/345/integer-underflow-in-x265-source-common

An integer underflow vulnerability exists in pixel-a.asm, the x86
assembly code for planeClipAndMax() in MulticoreWare x265 through 2.4,
as used by the x265_encoder_encode dependency in libbpg and other
products. A small picture can cause an integer underflow, which leads
to a Denial of Service in the process of encoding.
