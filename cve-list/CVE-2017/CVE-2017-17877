An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Link build 643. When the SSH
daemon is enabled for local development, the device is publicly
available via IPv6 TCP port 22 over the internet (with stateless
address autoconfiguration) by default, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain access by guessing 24 bits of the MAC address and
attempting a root login. This can be exploited in conjunction with
CVE-2017-17878.
