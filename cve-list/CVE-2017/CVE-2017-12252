A vulnerability in the Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility could
allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading
attack, potentially causing a partial impact to device availability,
confidentiality, and integrity. The vulnerability is due to the
application loading a malicious copy of a specific, nondefined DLL file
instead of the DLL file it was expecting. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by placing an affected DLL within the search path of
the host system. An exploit could allow the attacker to load a
malicious DLL file into the system, thus partially compromising
confidentiality, integrity, and availability on the device. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCve89785.
