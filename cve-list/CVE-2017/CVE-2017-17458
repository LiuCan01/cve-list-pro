In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially malformed
repository can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the
form of a .git/hooks/post-update script checked into the repository.
Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories,
but they can be created programmatically.
