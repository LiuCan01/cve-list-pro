OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content
Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows an
authenticated user to gain superuser privileges: Content Server stores
information about uploaded files in dmr_content objects, which are
queryable and "editable" (before release 7.2P02, any authenticated user
was able to edit dmr_content objects; now any authenticated user may
delete a dmr_content object and then create a new one with the old
identifier) by authenticated users; this allows any authenticated user
to replace the content of security-sensitive dmr_content objects (for
example, dmr_content related to dm_method objects) and gain superuser
privileges.
