The zend_string_extend function in Zend/zend_string.h in PHP through
7.1.5 does not prevent changes to string objects that result in a
negative length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
by leveraging a script's use of .= with a long string.
