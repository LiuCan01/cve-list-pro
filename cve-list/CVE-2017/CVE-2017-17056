The ZKTime Web Software 2.0.1.12280 allows the Administrator to
elevate the privileges of the application user using a
'password_change()' function of the Modify Password component,
reachable via the old_password, new_password1, and new_password2
parameters to the /accounts/password_change/ URI. An attacker takes
advantage of this scenario and creates a crafted CSRF link to add
himself as an administrator to the ZKTime Web Software. He then uses
social engineering methods to trick the administrator into clicking
the forged HTTP request. The request is executed and the attacker
becomes the Administrator of the ZKTime Web Software. If the
vulnerability is successfully exploited, then an attacker (who would
be a normal user of the web application) can escalate his privileges
and become the administrator of ZKTime Web Software.
