The Bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm does not consider a certain attack
methodology related to 80-byte block headers with a variety of initial
64-byte chunks followed by the same 16-byte chunk, multiple candidate
root values ending with the same 4 bytes, and calculations involving
sqrt numbers. This violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice
of input, outside of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the
Proof-of-Work function should not change its difficulty to evaluate and
(2) every Proof-of-Work function execution should be independent.
