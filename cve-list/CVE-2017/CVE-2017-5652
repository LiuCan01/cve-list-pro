During a routine security analysis, it was found that one of the ports
in Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 sent data in plaintext
even when the cluster was configured to use TLS. The port in question
was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class which did not use the
appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was turned on. It was
therefore possible for an adversary, with access to the network, to
eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming from that port and view
the data in plaintext.
