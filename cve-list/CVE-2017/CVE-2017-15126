Reference: MISC:https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.13.6

A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/userfaultfd.c in the Linux kernel
before 4.13.6. The issue is related to the handling of fork failure
when dealing with event messages. Failure to fork correctly can lead to
a situation where a fork event will be removed from an already freed
list of events with userfaultfd_ctx_put().
