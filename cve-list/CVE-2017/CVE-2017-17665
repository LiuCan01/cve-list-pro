Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4073

In Octopus Deploy before 4.1.3, the machine update process doesn't
check that the user has access to all environments. This allows an
access-control bypass because the set of environments to which a
machine is scoped may include environments in which the user lacks
access.
