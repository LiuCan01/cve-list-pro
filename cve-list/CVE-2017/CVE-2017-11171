Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-session/commit/b0dc999e0b45355314616321dbb6cb71e729fc9d

Bad reference counting in the context of accept_ice_connection() in
gsm-xsmp-server.c in old versions of gnome-session up until version
2.29.92 allows a local attacker to establish ICE connections to
gnome-session with invalid authentication data (an invalid magic
cookie). Each failed authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor
in gnome-session. When the maximum number of file descriptors is
exhausted in the gnome-session process, it will enter an infinite loop
trying to communicate without success, consuming 100% of the CPU. The
graphical session associated with the gnome-session process will stop
working correctly, because communication with gnome-session is no
longer possible.
