Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are
set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches
containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in
Jenkins. It did not properly check the current user's authentication
and authorization when configuring existing GitHub organization
folders. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub
organization folder to reconfigure it, including changing the GitHub
API endpoint for the organization folder to an attacker-controlled
server to obtain the GitHub access token, if the organization folder
was initially created using Blue Ocean.
