In F5 BIG-IP APM software version 13.0.0 and 12.1.2, in some
circumstances, APM tunneled VPN flows can cause a VPN/PPP connflow to
be prematurely freed or cause TMM to stop responding with a "flow not
in use" assertion. An attacker may be able to disrupt traffic or cause
the BIG-IP system to fail over to another device in the device group.
