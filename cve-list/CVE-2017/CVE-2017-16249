The Debut embedded http server contains a remotely exploitable denial
of service where a single malformed HTTP POST request can cause the
server to hang until eventually replying (~300 seconds) with an HTTP
500 error. While the server is hung, print jobs over the network are
blocked and the web interface is inaccessible. An attacker can
continuously send this malformed request to keep the device
inaccessible to legitimate traffic.
