The D-Link NPAPI extension, as used on D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with
firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware
through FW208WWb02) devices, does not verify X.509 certificates from
SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers
and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
