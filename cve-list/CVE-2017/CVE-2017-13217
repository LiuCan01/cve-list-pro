In DisplayFtmItem in the bootloader, there is an out-of-bounds write
due to reading a string without verifying that it's null-terminated.
This could lead to a secure boot bypass and a local elevation of
privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no
additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android
