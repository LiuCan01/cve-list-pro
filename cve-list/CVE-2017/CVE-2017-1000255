On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process
can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel
will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the
signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception
entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack,
allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary
values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if
panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written.
This flaw was introduced in commit: "5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable
transactional memory (TM) lazily for userspace)" which was merged
upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built with
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.
