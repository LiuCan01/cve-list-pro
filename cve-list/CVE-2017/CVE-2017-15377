In Suricata before 4.x, it was possible to trigger lots of redundant
checks on the content of crafted network traffic with a certain
signature, because of DetectEngineContentInspection in
detect-engine-content-inspection.c. The search engine doesn't stop when
it should after no match is found; instead, it stops only upon reaching
inspection-recursion-limit (3000 by default).
