Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in
webpagetest 3.0. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient
filtration of user-supplied data (benchmark, url) passed to the
webpagetest-master/www/benchmarks/trendurl.php URL. An attacker could
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of
the vulnerable website.
