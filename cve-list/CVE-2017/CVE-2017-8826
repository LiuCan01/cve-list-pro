FastStone Image Viewer 6.2 has a "User Mode Write AV" issue, possibly
related to the jpeg_mem_term function in jmemnobs.c in libjpeg. This
issue can be triggered by a malformed JPEG file that is mishandled by
FSViewer.exe. Attackers could exploit this issue for DoS (Access
Violation) or possibly unspecified other impact.
