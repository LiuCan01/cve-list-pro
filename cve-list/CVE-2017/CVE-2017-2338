A persistent cross site scripting vulnerability in NetScreen WebUI of
Juniper Networks Juniper NetScreen Firewall+VPN running ScreenOS
allows a user with the 'security' role to inject HTML/JavaScript
content into the management session of other users including the
administrator. This enables the lower-privileged user to effectively
execute commands with the permissions of an administrator. This issue
affects Juniper Networks ScreenOS 6.3.0 releases prior to 6.3.0r24 on
SSG Series. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are
affected by this issue.
