WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a
password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted
wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this
message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset
key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is
related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in
wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function.
Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at
least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim
from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time
(such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse
containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a
reply containing the original message.
