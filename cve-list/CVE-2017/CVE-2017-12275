A vulnerability in the implementation of 802.11v Basic Service Set
(BSS) Transition Management functionality in Cisco Wireless LAN
Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause
an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation of 802.11v BSS Transition Management Response packets that
an affected device receives from wireless clients. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed 802.11v BSS
Transition Management Response packet to an affected device. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected
device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvb57803.
