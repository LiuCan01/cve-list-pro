In Pivotal Spring-LDAP versions 1.3.0 - 2.3.1, when connected to some
LDAP servers, when no additional attributes are bound, and when using
LDAP BindAuthenticator with
org.springframework.ldap.core.support.DefaultTlsDirContextAuthenticationStrategy
as the authentication strategy, and setting userSearch, authentication
is allowed with an arbitrary password when the username is correct.
This occurs because some LDAP vendors require an explicit operation for
the LDAP bind to take effect.
