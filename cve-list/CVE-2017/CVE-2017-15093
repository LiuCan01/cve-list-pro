When api-config-dir is set to a non-empty value, which is not the case
by default, the API in PowerDNS Recursor 4.x up to and including 4.0.6
and 3.x up to and including 3.7.4 allows an authorized user to update
the Recursor's ACL by adding and removing netmasks, and to configure
forward zones. It was discovered that the new netmask and IP addresses
of forwarded zones were not sufficiently validated, allowing an
authenticated user to inject new configuration directives into the
Recursor's configuration.
