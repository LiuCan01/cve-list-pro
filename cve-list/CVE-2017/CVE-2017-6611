A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Prime Infrastructure
2.2(2) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the user of the web interface
of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation of some parameters passed to the web server. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user to access a
malicious link or by intercepting the user request and injecting the
malicious code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the
attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCuw65830.
