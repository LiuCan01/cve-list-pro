A Padding Oracle exists in OSCI-Transport 1.2 as used in OSCI Transport
Library 1.6.1 (Java) and OSCI Transport Library 1.6 (.NET). Under an
MITM condition within the OSCI infrastructure, an attacker needs to
send crafted protocol messages to analyse the CBC mode padding in order
to decrypt the transport encryption.
