The III_i_stereo function in layer3.c in mpglib, as used in
libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and
application crash) via a crafted audio file that is mishandled in the
code for the "block_type == 2" case, a similar issue to
CVE-2017-11126.
