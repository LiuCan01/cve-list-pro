The Microsoft Windows embedded OpenType (EOT) font engine in Windows 7
SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and 2008 R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012
allows an attacker to potentially read data that was not intended to
be disclosed, due to the way that the Microsoft Windows EOT font
engine parses specially crafted embedded fonts, aka "Windows EOT Font
Engine Information Disclosure Vulnerability." This CVE ID is unique
from CVE-2017-11835.
