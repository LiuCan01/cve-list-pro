WatchGuard Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier mishandles requests referring
to an XML External Entity (XXE), in the XML-RPC agent. This causes the
Firebox wgagent process to crash. This process crash ends all
authenticated sessions to the Firebox, including management
connections, and prevents new authenticated sessions until the process
has recovered. The Firebox may also experience an overall degradation
in performance while the wgagent process recovers. An attacker could
continuously send XML-RPC requests that contain references to external
entities to perform a limited Denial of Service (DoS) attack against an
affected Firebox.
