A vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call handling in
Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series devices could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because
the SIP process unexpectedly restarts. All active phone calls are
dropped as the SIP process restarts. The vulnerability is due to
incomplete input validation of the SIP packet header. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SIP packet to a
targeted phone. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS
condition because all phone calls are dropped when the SIP process
unexpectedly restarts. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc62590.
