A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV340, RV345, and
RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to access sensitive data. The attacker could use this
information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The
vulnerability is due to Cisco WebEx Meetings not sufficiently
protecting sensitive data when responding to an HTTP request to the
web interface. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by
attempting to use the HTTP protocol and looking at the data in the
HTTP responses from the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server. An exploit could
allow the attacker to find sensitive information about the
application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve37988. Known Affected Releases:
firmware 1.0.0.30, 1.0.0.33, 1.0.1.9, 1.0.1.16.
