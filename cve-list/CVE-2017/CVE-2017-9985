The snd_msndmidi_input_read function in sound/isa/msnd/msnd_midi.c in
the Linux kernel through 4.11.7 allows local users to cause a denial of
service (over-boundary access) or possibly have unspecified other
impact by changing the value of a message queue head pointer between
two kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability.
