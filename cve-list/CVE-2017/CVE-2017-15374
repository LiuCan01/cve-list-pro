Shopware v5.2.5 - v5.3 is vulnerable to cross site scripting in the
customer and order section of the content management system backend
modules. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code into
the firstname, lastname, or order input fields to provoke persistent
execution in the customer and orders section of the backend. The
execution occurs in the administrator backend listing when processing a
preview of the customers (kunden) or orders (bestellungen). The
injection can be performed interactively via user registration or by
manipulation of the order information inputs. The issue can be
exploited by low privileged user accounts against higher privileged
(admin or moderator) accounts.
