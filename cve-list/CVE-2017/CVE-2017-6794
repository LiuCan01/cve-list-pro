A vulnerability in the CLI command-parsing code of Cisco Meeting Server
could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command
injection and escalate their privileges to root. The attacker must
first authenticate to the application with valid administrator
credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input at the CLI for certain commands. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected
application and submitting a crafted CLI command for execution at the
Cisco Meeting Server CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to
perform command injection and escalate their privilege level to root.
Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability exists in Cisco Meeting Server
software versions prior to and including 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2. Cisco Bug
IDs: CSCvf53830.
