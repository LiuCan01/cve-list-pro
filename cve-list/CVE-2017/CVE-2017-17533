** DISPUTED ** default.tcl in Tkabber 1.1 does not validate strings
before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment
variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has
indicated that the attack cannot occur because of the argument-parsing
behavior of the Tcl exec function.
