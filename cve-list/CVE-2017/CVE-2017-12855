Xen maintains the _GTF_{read,writ}ing bits as appropriate, to inform
the guest that a grant is in use. A guest is expected not to modify
the grant details while it is in use, whereas the guest is free to
modify/reuse the grant entry when it is not in use. Under some
circumstances, Xen will clear the status bits too early, incorrectly
informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use. A guest may
prematurely believe that a granted frame is safely private again, and
reuse it in a way which contains sensitive information, while the
domain on the far end of the grant is still using the grant. Xen 4.9,
4.8, 4.7, 4.6, and 4.5 are affected.
