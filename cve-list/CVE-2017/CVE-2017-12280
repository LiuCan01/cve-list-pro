A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
Points (CAPWAP) Discovery Request parsing functionality of Cisco
Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting
in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to
incomplete input validation of fields in CAPWAP Discovery Request
packets by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted CAPWAP Discovery Request packets to an
affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
the affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS
condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb95842.
