ProFTPD before 1.3.5e and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc5 controls whether the
home directory of a user could contain a symbolic link through the
AllowChrootSymlinks configuration option, but checks only the last path
component when enforcing AllowChrootSymlinks. Attackers with local
access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing a path
component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat
model includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by
a hosting provider, but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP
user.
