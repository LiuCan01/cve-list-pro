Code injection vulnerability in Bitdefender Total Security 12.0 (and
earlier), Internet Security 12.0 (and earlier), and Antivirus Plus 12.0
(and earlier) allows a local attacker to bypass a self-protection
mechanism, inject arbitrary code, and take full control of any
Bitdefender process via a "DoubleAgent" attack. One perspective on this
issue is that (1) these products do not use the Protected Processes
feature, and therefore an attacker can enter an arbitrary Application
Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the
registry; (2) the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all
local processes (regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File
Execution Options for these products; and (3) this mechanism can be
bypassed by an attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution
Options during the attack.
