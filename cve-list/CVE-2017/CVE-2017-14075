This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on
Jungo WinDriver 12.4.0 and earlier. An attacker must first obtain the
ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order
to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
processing of IOCTL 0x953824a7 by the windrvr1240 kernel driver. The
issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied data
which can result in an out-of-bounds write condition. An attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the
context of kernel.
