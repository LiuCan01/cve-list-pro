An issue was discovered in EMC ScaleIO 2.0.1.x. In a Linux environment,
one of the support scripts saves the credentials of the ScaleIO MDM
user who executed the script in clear text in temporary log files. The
temporary files may potentially be read by an unprivileged user with
access to the server where the script was executed to recover exposed
credentials.
