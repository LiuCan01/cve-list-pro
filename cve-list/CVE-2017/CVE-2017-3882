A vulnerability in the Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) implementation in
the Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated,
Layer 2-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service (DoS) condition. The remote code execution could occur with
root privileges. The vulnerability is due to incomplete range checks of
the UPnP input data, which could result in a buffer overflow. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious
request to the UPnP listening port of the targeted device. An exploit
could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload or potentially
execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This vulnerability affects
all firmware releases of the Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Router prior
to Firmware Release 1.0.1.22. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz72642.
