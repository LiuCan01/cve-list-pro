Reference: MISC:https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/07/03/mpg123-global-buffer-overflow-in-iii_i_stereo-layer3-c/

The III_i_stereo function in libmpg123/layer3.c in mpg123 through
1.25.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer
over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file that is
mishandled in the code for the "block_type != 2" case, a similar issue
to CVE-2017-9870.
