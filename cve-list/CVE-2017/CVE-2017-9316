Firmware upgrade authentication bypass vulnerability was found in
Dahua IPC-HDW4300S and some IP products. The vulnerability was caused
by internal Debug function. This particular function was used for
problem analysis and performance tuning during product development
phase. It allowed the device to receive only specific data (one
direction, no transmit) and therefore it was not involved in any
instance of collecting user privacy data or allowing remote code
execution.
