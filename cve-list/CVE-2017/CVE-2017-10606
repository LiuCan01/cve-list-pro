Version 4.40 of the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) firmware on Juniper
Networks SRX300 Series has a weakness in generating cryptographic keys
that may allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information in SRX300
Series products. The TPM is used in the SRX300 Series to encrypt
sensitive configuration data. While other products also ship with a
TPM, no other products or platforms are affected by this
vulnerability. Customers can confirm the version of TPM firmware via
the 'show security tpm status' command. This issue was discovered by
an external security researcher. No other Juniper Networks products or
platforms are affected by this issue.
