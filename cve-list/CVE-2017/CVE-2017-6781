A vulnerability in the management of shell user accounts for Cisco
Policy Suite (CPS) Software for CPS appliances could allow an
authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges on an
affected system. The affected privilege level is not at the root
level. The vulnerability is due to incorrect role-based access control
(RBAC) for shell user accounts. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by authenticating to an affected appliance and providing
crafted user input via the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to acquire a higher privilege level than should have been
granted. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must log in to
the appliance with valid credentials. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve37724. Known
Affected Releases: 9.0.0, 9.1.0, 10.0.0, 11.0.0, 12.0.0.
