Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, 2003 SP3, and 2007 SP1
and SP2; PowerPoint Viewer 2003 and 2007 SP1 and SP2; PowerPoint in
Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac and 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format
Converter for Mac; Microsoft Works 8.5 and 9.0; and Microsoft Office
Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats
SP1 and SP2 do not properly validate PowerPoint files, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via multiple crafted
BuildList records that include ChartBuild containers, which triggers
memory corruption, aka "Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
