Directory traversal vulnerability in InstallHFZ.exe 6.5.201.0 in
Pinnacle Hollywood Effects 6, a module in Pinnacle Systems Pinnacle
Studio 12, allows remote attackers to create and overwrite arbitrary
files via a filename containing a .. (dot dot backslash) sequence in
a Hollywood FX Compressed Archive (.hfz) file.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged for code execution by decompressing a file to a Startup
folder.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
