The Mail component in Apple iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1 and iPhone OS
for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1 dismisses the call approval dialog
when another alert appears, which might allow remote attackers to
force the iPhone to place a call without user approval by causing an
application to trigger an alert.
