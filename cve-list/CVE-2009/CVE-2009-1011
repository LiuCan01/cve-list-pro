Unspecified vulnerability in the Outside In Technology component in
Oracle Application Server 8.2.2 and 8.3.0 allows local users to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, related to HTML.  NOTE:
the previous information was obtained from the April 2009 CPU.  Oracle
has not commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is for
multiple integer overflows in a function that parses an optional data
stream within a Microsoft Office file, leading to a heap-based buffer
overflow.
