The D-Link DIR-615 with firmware 3.10NA does not require
administrative authentication for apply.cgi, which allows remote
attackers to (1) change the admin password via the admin_password
parameter, (2) disable the security requirement for the Wi-Fi network
via unspecified vectors, or (3) modify DNS settings via unspecified
vectors.
