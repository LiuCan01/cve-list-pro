Directory traversal vulnerability in html2ps before 1.0b6 allows
remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the
"include file" SSI directive.  NOTE: this issue only might be a
vulnerability in limited scenarios, such as if html2ps is invoked by a
web application, or if a user-assisted attacker provides filenames
whose contents could cause a denial of service, such as certain
devices.
