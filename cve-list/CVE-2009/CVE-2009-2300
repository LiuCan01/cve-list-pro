The management interface in the phion airlock Web Application Firewall
(WAF) 4.1-10.41 does not properly handle CGI requests that specify
large width and height parameters for an image, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands or cause a denial of service
(resource consumption) via a crafted request.
