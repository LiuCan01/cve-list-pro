Tor 0.2.0.28, and probably 0.2.0.34 and earlier, allows remote
attackers, with control of an entry router and an exit router, to
confirm that a sender and receiver are communicating via vectors
involving (1) replaying, (2) modifying, (3) inserting, or (4) deleting
a single cell, and then observing cell recognition errors at the exit
router.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue,
noting that the product's design "accepted end-to-end correlation as
an attack that is too expensive to solve."
