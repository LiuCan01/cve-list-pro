McAfee GroupShield for Microsoft Exchange on Exchange Server 2000, and
possibly other anti-virus or anti-spam products from McAfee or other
vendors, does not scan X- headers for malicious content, which allows
remote attackers to bypass virus detection via a crafted message, as
demonstrated by a message with an X-Testing header and no message
body.
