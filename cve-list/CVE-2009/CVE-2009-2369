Integer overflow in the wxImage::Create function in
src/common/image.cpp in wxWidgets 2.8.10 allows attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
crafted JPEG file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE:
the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are
obtained solely from third party information.
