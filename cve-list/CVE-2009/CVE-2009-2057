Microsoft Internet Explorer before 8 uses the HTTP Host header to
determine the context of a document provided in a (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx
CONNECT response from a proxy server, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to execute arbitrary web script by modifying this CONNECT
response, aka an "SSL tampering" attack.
