CRE Loaded before 6.2.14, and possibly other versions before 6.3.x,
allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain
administrator privileges via a request with (1) login.php or (2)
password_forgotten.php appended as the PATH_INFO, which bypasses a
check that uses PHP_SELF, which is not properly handled by (a)
includes/application_top.php and (b)
admin/includes/application_top.php, as exploited in the wild in 2009.
