Argument injection vulnerability in the chromehtml: protocol handler
in Google Chrome before 1.0.154.59, when invoked by Internet Explorer,
allows remote attackers to determine the existence of files, and open
tabs for URLs that do not satisfy the IsWebSafeScheme restriction, via
a web page that sets document.location to a chromehtml: value, as
demonstrated by use of a (1) javascript: or (2) data: URL.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged for Universal XSS by exploiting certain behavior
involving persistence across page transitions.
