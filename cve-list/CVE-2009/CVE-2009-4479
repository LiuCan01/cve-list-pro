LDAP3A.exe in MailSite 8.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (heap memory corruption and daemon crash) via unspecified
vectors, as demonstrated by a certain module in VulnDisco Pack
Professional 7.13 through 8.11.  NOTE: as of 20091229, this disclosure
has no actionable information. However, because the VulnDisco Pack
author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE
identifier for tracking purposes.
