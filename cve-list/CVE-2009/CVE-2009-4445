Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), when used in
conjunction with unspecified third-party upload applications, allows
remote attackers to create empty files with arbitrary extensions via a
filename containing an initial extension followed by a : (colon) and a
safe extension, as demonstrated by an upload of a .asp:.jpg file that
results in creation of an empty .asp file, related to support for the
NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) filename syntax.  NOTE: it could be
argued that this is a vulnerability in the third-party product, not
IIS, because the third-party product should be applying its extension
restrictions to the portion of the filename before the colon.
