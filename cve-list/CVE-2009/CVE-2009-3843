HP Operations Manager 8.10 on Windows contains a "hidden account" in
the XML file that specifies Tomcat users, which allows remote
attackers to conduct unrestricted file upload attacks, and thereby
execute arbitrary code, by using the
org.apache.catalina.manager.HTMLManagerServlet class to make requests
to manager/html/upload.
