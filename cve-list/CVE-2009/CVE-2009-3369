CgiUserConfigEdit in BackupPC 3.1.0, when SSH keys and Rsync are in
use in a multi-user environment, does not restrict users from the
ClientNameAlias function, which allows remote authenticated users to
read and write sensitive files by modifying ClientNameAlias to match
another system, then initiating a backup or restore.
