NOS Microsystems getPlus Download Manager, as used in Adobe Reader
1.6.2.36 and possibly other versions, Corel getPlus Download Manager
before 1.5.0.48, and possibly other products, installs
NOSbingetPlus_HelperSvc.exe with insecure permissions (Everyone:Full
Control), which allows local users to gain SYSTEM privileges by
replacing getPlus_HelperSvc.exe with a Trojan horse program, as
demonstrated by use of getPlus Download Manager within Adobe
Reader. NOTE: within Adobe Reader, the scope of this issue is limited
because the program is deleted and the associated service is not
automatically launched after a successful installation and reboot.
