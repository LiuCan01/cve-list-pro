Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 3.x and
InterScan Web Security Suite (IWSS) 3.x, when basic authorization is
enabled on the standalone proxy, forwards the Proxy-Authorization
header from Windows Media Player, which allows remote web servers to
obtain credentials by offering a media stream and then capturing this
header.
