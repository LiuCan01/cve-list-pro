Zen Cart 1.3.8a, 1.3.8, and earlier does not require administrative
authentication for admin/record_company.php, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a .php file via the
record_company_image parameter in conjunction with a PATH_INFO of
password_forgotten.php, then accessing this file via a direct request
to the file in images/.
