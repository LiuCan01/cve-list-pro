Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=492196

Mozilla Necko, as used in Thunderbird 3.0.1, SeaMonkey, and other
applications, performs DNS prefetching even when the app type is
APP_TYPE_MAIL or APP_TYPE_EDITOR, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to determine the network location of the application's user
by logging DNS requests, as demonstrated by DNS requests triggered by
reading text/plain e-mail messages in Thunderbird.
