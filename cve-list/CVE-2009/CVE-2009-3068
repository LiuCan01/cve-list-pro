Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the RoboHelpServer Servlet
(robohelp/server) in Adobe RoboHelp Server 8 allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code by uploading a Java Archive (.jsp) file
during a PUBLISH action, then accessing it via a direct request to the
file in the robohelp/robo/reserved/web directory under its sessionid
subdirectory, as demonstrated by the vd_adobe module in VulnDisco Pack
Professional 8.7 through 8.11.
