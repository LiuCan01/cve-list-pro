The web console in Symantec Altiris Notification Server 6.0.x before
6.0 SP3 R12 uses a hardcoded key that can decrypt SQL Server
credentials and certain discovery credentials, and stores this key on
the Notification Server machine, which allows local users to obtain
sensitive information and possibly execute arbitrary code by
decrypting and using these credentials.
