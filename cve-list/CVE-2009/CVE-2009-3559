** DISPUTED **

main/streams/plain_wrapper.c in PHP 5.3.x before 5.3.1 does not
recognize the safe_mode_include_dir directive, which allows
context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact by triggering
the failure of PHP scripts that perform include or require operations,
as demonstrated by a script that attempts to perform a require_once on
a file in a standard library directory.  NOTE: a reliable third party
reports that this is not a vulnerability, because it results in a more
restrictive security policy.
