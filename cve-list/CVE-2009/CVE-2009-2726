The SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x before 1.2.34,
1.4.x before 1.4.26.1, 1.6.0.x before 1.6.0.12, and 1.6.1.x before
1.6.1.4; Asterisk Business Edition A.x.x, B.x.x before B.2.5.9, C.2.x
before C.2.4.1, and C.3.x before C.3.1; and Asterisk Appliance s800i
1.2.x before 1.3.0.3 does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf
style functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (stack memory consumption) via SIP packets containing large
sequences of ASCII decimal characters, as demonstrated via vectors
related to (1) the CSeq value in a SIP header, (2) large
Content-Length value, and (3) SDP.
