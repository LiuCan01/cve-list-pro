Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Elvin 1.2.0 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) inUser (aka
Username) and (2) inPass (aka Password) parameters to (a)
inc/login.ei, reachable through login.php; and the (3) id parameter to
(b) show_bug.php and (c) show_activity.php.  NOTE: it was later
reported that vector 3c also affects 1.2.2.
