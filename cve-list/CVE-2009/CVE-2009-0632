The IP Phone Personal Address Book (PAB) Synchronizer feature in Cisco
Unified Communications Manager (aka CUCM, formerly CallManager) 4.1,
4.2 before 4.2(3)SR4b, 4.3 before 4.3(2)SR1b, 5.x before 5.1(3e), 6.x
before 6.1(3), and 7.0 before 7.0(2) sends privileged
directory-service account credentials to the client in cleartext,
which allows remote attackers to modify the CUCM configuration and
perform other privileged actions by intercepting these credentials,
and then using them in requests unrelated to the intended
synchronization task, as demonstrated by (1) DC Directory account
credentials in CUCM 4.x and (2) TabSyncSysUser account credentials in
CUCM 5.x through 7.x.
