The httpClientDiscardBody function in client.c in Polipo 0.9.8,
0.9.12, 1.0.4, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a request with a large
Content-Length value, which triggers an integer overflow, a
signed-to-unsigned conversion error with a negative value, and a
segmentation fault.
