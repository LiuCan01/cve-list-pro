OpenSAML 2.x before 2.2.1 and XMLTooling 1.x before 1.2.1, as used by
Internet2 Shibboleth Service Provider 2.x before 2.2.1, do not follow
the KeyDescriptor element's Use attribute, which allows remote
attackers to use a certificate for both signing and encryption when it
is designated for just one purpose, potentially weakening the intended
security application of the certificate.
