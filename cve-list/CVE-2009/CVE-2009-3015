QtWeb 3.0 Builds 001 and 003 does not properly block javascript: and
data: URIs in Refresh and Location headers in HTTP responses, which
allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
via vectors related to (1) injecting a Refresh header that contains a
javascript: URI, (2) entering a javascript: URI when specifying the
content of a Refresh header, (3) injecting a Refresh header that
contains JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html URI, (4) entering a
data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences when specifying the
content of a Refresh header, (5) injecting a Location header that
contains JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html URI, or (6) entering
a data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences when specifying the
content of a Location header.
