filter.php in PHPFootball 1.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to
retrieve password hashes via a request with an Accounts value for the
dbtable parameter, in conjunction with a Password value for the
dbfield parameter.  NOTE: this has been reported as a SQL injection
vulnerability by some sources, but the provenance of that information
is unknown.
