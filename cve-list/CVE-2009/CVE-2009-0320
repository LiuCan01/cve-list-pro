Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003 and 2008, and Vista exposes I/O
activity measurements of all processes, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information, as demonstrated by reading the I/O Other
Bytes column in Task Manager (aka taskmgr.exe) to estimate the number
of characters that a different user entered at a runas.exe password
prompt, related to a "benchmarking attack."
