The JavaScript for Acrobat API in Adobe Reader and Acrobat 7.x before
7.1.4, 8.x before 8.1.7, and 9.x before 9.2 does not properly
implement the (1) Privileged Context and (2) Safe Path restrictions
for unspecified JavaScript methods, which allows remote attackers to
create arbitrary files, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via the
cPath parameter in a crafted PDF file.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
