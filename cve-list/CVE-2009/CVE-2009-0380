** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in the Sigsiu Online Business Index 2
(SOBI2, com_sobi2) RC 2.8.2 component for Joomla! and Mambo allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the bid
parameter in a showbiz action to index.php, a different vector than
CVE-2008-0607.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue, since neither "showbiz"
nor "bid" appears in the source code for SOBI2.
