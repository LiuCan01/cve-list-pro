The Servlet Engine/Web Container component in IBM WebSphere
Application Server (WAS) 6.0.2 before 6.0.2.37 does not properly
implement security constraints on the (1) doGet and (2) doTrace
methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and obtain sensitive information via a crafted HTTP HEAD
request to a Web Application.
