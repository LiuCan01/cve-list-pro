Opera, possibly before 9.25, uses the HTTP Host header to determine
the context of a document provided in a (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT
response from a proxy server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
to execute arbitrary web script by modifying this CONNECT response,
aka an "SSL tampering" attack.
