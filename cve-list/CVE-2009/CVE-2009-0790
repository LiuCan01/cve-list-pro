The pluto IKE daemon in Openswan and Strongswan IPsec 2.6 before
2.6.21 and 2.4 before 2.4.14, and Strongswan 4.2 before 4.2.14 and 2.8
before 2.8.9, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(daemon crash and restart) via a crafted (1) R_U_THERE or (2)
R_U_THERE_ACK Dead Peer Detection (DPD) IPsec IKE Notification message
that triggers a NULL pointer dereference related to inconsistent
ISAKMP state and the lack of a phase2 state association in DPD.
