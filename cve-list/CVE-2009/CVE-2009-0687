The pf_test_rule function in OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF), as used in
OpenBSD 4.2 through 4.5, NetBSD 5.0 before RC3, MirOS 10 and earlier,
and MidnightBSD 0.3-current allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (panic) via crafted IP packets that trigger a NULL pointer
dereference during translation, related to an IPv4 packet with an
ICMPv6 payload.
