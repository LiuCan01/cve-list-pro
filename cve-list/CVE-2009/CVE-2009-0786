** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: none.  Reason: This was
originally intended for a report about TCP Wrappers and the hosts_ctl
API function, but further investigation showed that this was
documented behavior by that function.  Notes: Future CVE identifiers
might be assigned to applications that mis-use the API in a
security-relevant fashion.
