Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 SP3, 1.1 SP1, and 2.0 SP1 does not
properly validate .NET verifiable code, which allows remote attackers
to obtain unintended access to stack memory, and execute arbitrary
code, via (1) a crafted XAML browser application (XBAP), (2) a crafted
ASP.NET application, or (3) a crafted .NET Framework application, aka
"Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability."
