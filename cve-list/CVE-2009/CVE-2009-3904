classes/session/cc_admin_session.php in CubeCart 4.3.4 does not
properly restrict administrative access permissions, which allows
remote attackers to bypass restrictions and gain administrative access
via a HTTP request that contains an empty (1) sessID (ccAdmin cookie),
(2) X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP header, or (3) User-Agent header.
