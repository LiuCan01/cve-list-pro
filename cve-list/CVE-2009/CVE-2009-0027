The request handler in JBossWS in JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform (aka JBoss EAP or JBEAP) 4.2 before 4.2.0.CP06 and 4.3 before
4.3.0.CP04 does not properly validate the resource path during a
request for a WSDL file with a custom web-service endpoint, which
allows remote attackers to read arbitrary XML files via a crafted
request.
