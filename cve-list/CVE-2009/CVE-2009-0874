Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the Doors subsystem in the
kernel in Sun Solaris 8 through 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_94,
allow local users to cause a denial of service (process hang), or
possibly bypass file permissions or gain kernel-context privileges,
via vectors including ones related to (1) an argument handling
deadlock in a door server and (2) watchpoint problems in the door_call
function.
