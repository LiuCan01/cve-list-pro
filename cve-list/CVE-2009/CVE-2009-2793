Reference: BUGTRAQ:20090916 Iret #GP on pre-commit handling failure: the NetBSD case (CVE-2009-2793)
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/506531/100/0/threaded

The kernel in NetBSD, probably 5.0.1 and earlier, on x86 platforms
does not properly handle a pre-commit failure of the iret instruction,
which might allow local users to gain privileges via vectors related
to a tempEIP pseudocode variable that is outside of the code-segment
limits.
