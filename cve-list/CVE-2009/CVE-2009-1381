The map_yp_alias function in functions/imap_general.php in
SquirrelMail before 1.4.19-1 on Debian GNU/Linux, and possibly other
operating systems and versions, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a username string that
is used by the ypmatch program.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1579.
