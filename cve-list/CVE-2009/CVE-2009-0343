Niels Provos Systrace 1.6f and earlier on the x86_64 Linux platform
allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by making a
32-bit syscall with a syscall number that corresponds to a
policy-compliant 64-bit syscall, related to race conditions that occur
in monitoring 64-bit processes.
