Squid 3.0 through 3.0.STABLE16 and 3.1 through 3.1.0.11 does not
properly enforce "buffer limits and related bound checks," which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) an
incomplete request or (2) a request with a large header size, related
to (a) HttpMsg.cc and (b) client_side.cc.
