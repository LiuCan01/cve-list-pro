xscreensaver (aka Gnome-XScreenSaver) in Sun Solaris 10, and
OpenSolaris snv_109 through snv_122, does not properly handle Trusted
Extensions, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption and console hang) by locking the screen, related to a
regression in certain Solaris and OpenSolaris patches.
