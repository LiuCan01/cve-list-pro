KDE KSSL in kdelibs 3.5.4, 4.2.4, and 4.3 does not properly handle a
'0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field
of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a
legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
