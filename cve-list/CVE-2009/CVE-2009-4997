gnome-power-manager 2.27.92 does not properly implement the
lock_on_suspend and lock_on_hibernate settings for locking the screen
when the suspend or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it
easier for physically proximate attackers to access an unattended
laptop via a resume action, a related issue to CVE-2010-2532.  NOTE:
this issue exists because of a regression that followed a
gnome-power-manager fix a few years earlier.
