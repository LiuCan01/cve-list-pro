The ABI in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier on s390, powerpc,
sparc64, and mips 64-bit platforms requires that a 32-bit argument in
a 64-bit register was properly sign extended when sent from a
user-mode application, but cannot verify this, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges
via a crafted system call.
