Interaction error in xdg-open allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by sending a file with a dangerous MIME type but using
a safe type that Firefox sends to xdg-open, which causes xdg-open to
process the dangerous file type through automatic type detection, as
demonstrated by overwriting the .desktop file.
