IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) 6.2.0 before 6.2.0.2,
when configured as an OpenID provider, does not delete the site
information cookie in response to a user's deletion of a relying-party
trust entry, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass
intended trust restrictions via vectors that trigger absence of the
consent-to-authenticate page.
