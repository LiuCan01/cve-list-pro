libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.8.2 does not properly handle a '0'
character in a domain name in the subject's (1) Common Name (CN) or
(2) Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of an X.509 certificate,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL
servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
Authority.
