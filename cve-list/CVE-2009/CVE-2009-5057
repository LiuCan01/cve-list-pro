The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.4
does not configure the RANDFILE and HOME environment variables for
OpenSSL, which might make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt
e-mail messages that had lower than intended entropy available for
cryptographic operations, related to inability to write to the seeding
file.
