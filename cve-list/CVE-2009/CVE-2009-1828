Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (infinite loop, application hang, and memory consumption) via
a KEYGEN element in conjunction with (1) a META element specifying
automatic page refresh or (2) a JavaScript onLoad event handler for a
BODY element. NOTE: it was later reported that earlier versions are
also affected.
