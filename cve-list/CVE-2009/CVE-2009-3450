Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
WebCoreModule.ashx in RADactive I-Load before 2008.2.5.0 allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via parameters with
names beginning with __ (underscore underscore) sequences, which are
incompatible with an XSS protection mechanism provided by Microsoft
ASP.NET.
