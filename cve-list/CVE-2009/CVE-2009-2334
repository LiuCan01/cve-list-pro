wp-admin/admin.php in WordPress and WordPress MU before 2.8.1 does not
require administrative authentication to access the configuration of a
plugin, which allows remote attackers to specify a configuration file
in the page parameter to obtain sensitive information or modify this
file, as demonstrated by the (1) collapsing-archives/options.txt, (2)
akismet/readme.txt, (3) related-ways-to-take-action/options.php, (4)
wp-security-scan/securityscan.php, and (5) wp-ids/ids-admin.php files.
NOTE: this can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial
of service.
