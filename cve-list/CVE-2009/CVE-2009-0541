Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Magento 1.2.0
and 1.2.1.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via (1) the username field in an admin/ request to index.php,
possibly related to the login[username] parameter and the
app/code/core/Mage/Admin/Model/Session.php login function; (2) the
email address field in an admin/index/forgotpassword/ request to
index.php, possibly related to the email parameter and the
app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/IndexController.php
forgotpasswordAction function; or (3) the return parameter to the
default URI under downloader/.
