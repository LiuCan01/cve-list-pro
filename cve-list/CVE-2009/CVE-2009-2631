Multiple clientless SSL VPN products that run in web browsers,
including Stonesoft StoneGate; Cisco ASA; SonicWALL E-Class SSL VPN
and SonicWALL SSL VPN; SafeNet SecureWire Access Gateway; Juniper
Networks Secure Access; Nortel CallPilot; Citrix Access Gateway; and
other products, when running in configurations that do not restrict
access to the same domain as the VPN, retrieve the content of remote
URLs from one domain and rewrite them so they originate from the VPN's
domain, which violates the same origin policy and allows remote
attackers to conduct cross-site scripting attacks, read cookies that
originated from other domains, access the Web VPN session to gain
access to internal resources, perform key logging, and conduct other
attacks.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a fundamental design
problem in any clientless VPN solution, as opposed to a
commonly-introduced error that can be fixed in separate
implementations. Therefore a single CVE has been assigned for all
products that have this design.
