The ThreadPool class in Windows Vista Gold and SP1, and Server 2008,
does not properly implement isolation among a set of distinct
processes that (1) all run under the NetworkService account or (2) all
run under the LocalService account, which allows local users to gain
privileges by leveraging incorrect thread ACLs to access the resources
of one of the processes, aka "Windows Thread Pool ACL Weakness
Vulnerability."
