Blue Coat ProxySG, when transparent interception mode is enabled, uses
the HTTP Host header to determine the remote endpoint, which allows
remote attackers to bypass access controls for Flash, Java,
Silverlight, and probably other technologies, and possibly communicate
with restricted intranet sites, via a crafted web page that causes a
client to send HTTP requests with a modified Host header.
