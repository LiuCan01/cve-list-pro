Microsoft XML Core Services, as used in Microsoft Expression Web,
Office, Internet Explorer 6 and 7, and other products, does not
properly restrict access from web pages to Set-Cookie2 HTTP response
headers, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
from cookies via XMLHttpRequest calls, related to the HTTPOnly
protection mechanism.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4033.
