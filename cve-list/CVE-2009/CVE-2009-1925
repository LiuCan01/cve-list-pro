The TCP/IP implementation in Microsoft Windows Vista Gold, SP1, and
SP2 and Server 2008 Gold and SP2 does not properly manage state
information, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
by sending packets to a listening service, and thereby triggering
misinterpretation of an unspecified field as a function pointer, aka
"TCP/IP Timestamps Code Execution Vulnerability."
