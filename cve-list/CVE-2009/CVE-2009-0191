Foxit Reader 2.3 before Build 3902 and 3.0 before Build 1506,
including 3.0.2009.1301, does not properly handle a JBIG2 symbol
dictionary segment with zero new symbols, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that
triggers a dereference of an uninitialized memory location.
