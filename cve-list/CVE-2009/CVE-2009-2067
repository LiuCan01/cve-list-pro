Opera detects http content in https web pages only when the top-level
frame uses https, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute
arbitrary web script, in an https site's context, by modifying an http
page to include an https iframe that references a script file on an
http site, related to "HTTP-Intended-but-HTTPS-Loadable (HPIHSL)
pages."
