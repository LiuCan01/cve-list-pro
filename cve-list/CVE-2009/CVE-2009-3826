Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote attackers to
bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL, related to (1) the
relationship between a certain buffer size in squidGuard and a certain
buffer size in Squid and (2) a redirect URL that contains information
about the originally requested URL.
