Mozilla Necko, as used in Firefox, SeaMonkey, and other applications,
performs DNS prefetching of domain names contained in links within
local HTML documents, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
determine the network location of the application's user by logging
DNS requests.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this
issue, stating "I don't think we necessarily need to worry about that
case."
