cfg80211 in net/wireless/scan.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.30-rc1 and
other versions before 2.6.31-rc6 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) via a sequence of beacon frames in which one
frame omits an SSID Information Element (IE) and the subsequent frame
contains an SSID IE, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the
cmp_ies function.  NOTE: a potential weakness in the is_mesh function
was also addressed, but the relevant condition did not exist in the
code, so it is not a vulnerability.
