The WINS server in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 and Server 2003 SP1 and
SP2 does not restrict registration of the (1) "wpad" and (2) "isatap"
NetBIOS names, which allows remote authenticated users to hijack the
Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) and Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel
Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) features, and conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks by spoofing a proxy server or ISATAP route, by registering one
of these names in the WINS database, aka "WPAD WINS Server
Registration Vulnerability," a related issue to CVE-2007-1692.
