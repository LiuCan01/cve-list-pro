CFNetwork in Apple Mac OS X 10.5 before 10.5.8 places an incorrect URL
in a certificate warning in certain 302 redirection scenarios, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into visiting an
arbitrary https web site by leveraging an open redirect vulnerability,
a different issue than CVE-2009-2062.
