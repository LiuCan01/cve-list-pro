The Profiles component in Apple iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1 and iPhone
OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1, when installing a configuration
profile, can replace the password policy from Exchange ActiveSync with
a weaker password policy, which allows physically proximate attackers
to bypass the intended policy.
