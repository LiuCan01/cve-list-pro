** REJECT **

Format string vulnerability in the University of Washington (UW)
c-client library, as used by the UW IMAP toolkit imap-2007d and other
applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
format string specifiers in the initial request to the IMAP port
(143/tcp).  NOTE: Red Hat has disputed the vulnerability, stating "The
Red Hat Security Response Team have been unable to confirm the
existence of this format string vulnerability in the toolkit, and the
sample published exploit is not complete or functional."  CVE agrees
that the exploit contains syntax errors and uses Unix-only include
files while invoking Windows functions.
