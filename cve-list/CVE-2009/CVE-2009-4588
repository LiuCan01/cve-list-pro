Heap-based buffer overflow in the WindsPlayerIE.View.1 ActiveX control
in WindsPly.ocx 3.5.0.0 Beta, 3.0.0.5, and earlier in AwingSoft
Awakening Web3D Player and Winds3D Viewer allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary
code via a long SceneUrl property value, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2009-2386.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
