Buffer overflow in the ActiveX control in Novell iPrint Client 4.38
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown attack vectors, as
demonstrated by a certain module in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.1,
"Novell iPrint Client 4.38 ActiveX exploit." NOTE: as of 20090909,
this disclosure has no actionable information. However, because the
VulnDisco Pack author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being
assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
