Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in IsolSoft Support
Center 2.5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the lang parameter to (1) newticket.php or (2) rempass.php, or
a URL in the lang parameter in an adduser action to (3) index.php.
NOTE: this can also be leveraged to include and execute arbitrary
local files via .. (dot dot) sequences.
