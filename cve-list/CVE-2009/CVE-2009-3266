Opera before 10.01 does not properly restrict HTML in a (1) RSS or (2)
Atom feed, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks, and conduct cross-zone scripting attacks
involving the Feed Subscription Page to read feeds or create feed
subscriptions, via a crafted feed, related to the rendering of the
application/rss+xml content type as "scripted content."
