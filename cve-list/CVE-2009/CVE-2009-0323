Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in W3C Amaya Web Browser 10.0
and 11.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a
long type parameter in an input tag, which is not properly handled by
the EndOfXmlAttributeValue function; (2) an "HTML GI" in a start tag,
which is not properly handled by the ProcessStartGI function; and
unspecified vectors in (3) html2thot.c and (4) xml2thot.c, related to
the msgBuffer variable.  NOTE: these are different vectors than
CVE-2008-6005.
