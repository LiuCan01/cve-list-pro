Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Intel system software for
Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) allow attackers to bypass intended
loader integrity protections, as demonstrated by exploitation of
tboot.  NOTE: as of 20090107, the only disclosure is a vague
pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, because it is
from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier
for tracking purposes.
