Use-after-free vulnerability in the servePendingRequests function in
WebCore in WebKit in Apple Safari 4.0 and 4.0.1 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document that references a
zero-length .js file and the JavaScript reload function.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
