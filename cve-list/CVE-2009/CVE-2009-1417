gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation and
expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote attackers
to successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2)
no longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the
_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in
libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup.
