Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2006 Gold
and SP1, when Radius OTP is enabled, uses the HTTP-Basic
authentication method, which allows remote attackers to gain the
privileges of an arbitrary account, and access published web pages,
via vectors involving attempted access to a network resource behind
the ISA Server, aka "Radius OTP Bypass Vulnerability."
