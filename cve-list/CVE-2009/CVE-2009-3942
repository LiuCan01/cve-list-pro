Martin Lambers msmtp before 1.4.19, when OpenSSL is used, does not
properly handle a '0' character in a domain name in the (1) subject's
Common Name or (2) Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509
certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
