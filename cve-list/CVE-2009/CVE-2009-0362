filter.d/wuftpd.conf in Fail2ban 0.8.3 uses an incorrect regular
expression that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(forced authentication failures) via a crafted reverse-resolved DNS
name (rhost) entry that contains a substring that is interpreted as an
IP address, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-4321.
