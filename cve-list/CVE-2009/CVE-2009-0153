International Components for Unicode (ICU) 4.0, 3.6, and other 3.x
versions, as used in Apple Mac OS X 10.5 before 10.5.7, iPhone OS 1.0
through 2.2.1, iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1, Fedora 9
and 10, and possibly other operating systems, does not properly handle
invalid byte sequences during Unicode conversion, which might allow
remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
