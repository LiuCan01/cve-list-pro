sys_term.c in telnetd in FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE and other 7.x versions
deletes dangerous environment variables with a method that was valid
only in older FreeBSD distributions, which might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by passing a crafted environment
variable from a telnet client, as demonstrated by an LD_PRELOAD value
that references a malicious library.
