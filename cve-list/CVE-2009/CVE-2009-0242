** REJECT **

gmetad in Ganglia 3.1.1, when supporting multiple requests per
connection on an interactive port, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service via a request to the gmetad service with a path that
does not exist, which causes Ganglia to (1) perform excessive CPU
computation and (2) send the entire tree, which consumes network
bandwidth.  NOTE: the vendor and original researcher have disputed
this issue, since legitimate requests can generate the same amount of
resource consumption.  CVE concurs with the dispute, so this
identifier should not be used.
