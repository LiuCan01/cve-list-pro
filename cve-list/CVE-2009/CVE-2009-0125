** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the upstream vendor.
nasl/nasl_crypto2.c in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language library
(aka libnasl) 2.2.11 does not properly check the return value from the
OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function, which allows remote attackers to
bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS
signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: the
upstream vendor has disputed this issue, stating "while we do misuse
this function (this is a bug), it has absolutely no security
ramification."
