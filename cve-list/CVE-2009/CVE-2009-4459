Redmine 0.8.7 and earlier uses the title tag before defining the
character encoding in a meta tag, which allows remote attackers to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and inject arbitrary script
via UTF-7 encoded values in the title parameter to a new issue page,
which may be interpreted as script by Internet Explorer 7 and 8.
