Stack-based buffer overflow in the btFiles::BuildFromMI function
(trunk/btfiles.cpp) in Enhanced CTorrent (aka dTorrent) 3.3.2 and
probably earlier, and CTorrent 1.3.4, allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
Torrent file containing a long path.
