Multiple static code injection vulnerabilities in the saveFeed
function in rss/feedcreator.class.php in Bitweaver 2.6 and earlier
allow (1) remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary PHP code into
files by placing PHP sequences into the account's "display name"
setting and then invoking boards/boards_rss.php, and might allow (2)
remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into files via the HTTP
Host header in a request to boards/boards_rss.php.
