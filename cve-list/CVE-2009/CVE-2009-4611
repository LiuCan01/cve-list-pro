Mort Bay Jetty 6.x and 7.0.0 writes backtrace data without sanitizing
non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to modify
a window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite
files, via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a
terminal emulator, related to (1) a string value in the Age parameter
to the default URI for the Cookie Dump Servlet in
test-jetty-webapp/src/main/java/com/acme/CookieDump.java under
cookie/, (2) an alphabetic value in the A parameter to jsp/expr.jsp,
or (3) an alphabetic value in the Content-Length HTTP header to an
arbitrary application.
