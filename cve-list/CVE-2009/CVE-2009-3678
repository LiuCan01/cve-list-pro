Integer overflow in cdd.dll in the Canonical Display Driver (CDD) in
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 on 64-bit platforms,
when the Windows Aero theme is installed, allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted image file that triggers incorrect data
parsing after user-mode data is copied to kernel mode, as demonstrated
using "Browse with Irfanview" and certain actions on a folder
containing a large number of thumbnail images in Resample mode,
possibly related to the ATI graphics driver or win32k.sys, aka
"Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability."
