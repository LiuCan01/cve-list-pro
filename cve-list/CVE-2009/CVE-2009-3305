Polipo 1.0.4, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a request with a Cache-Control
header that lacks a value for the max-age field, which triggers a
segmentation fault in the httpParseHeaders function in http_parse.c,
and possibly other unspecified vectors.
