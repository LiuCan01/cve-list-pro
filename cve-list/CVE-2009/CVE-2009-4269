The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication
functionality for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a
transformation that reduces the size of the set of inputs to SHA-1,
which produces a small search space that makes it easier for local and
possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating hash
collisions, related to password substitution.
