Google Chrome before 1.0.154.53 displays a cached certificate for a
(1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT response page returned by a proxy server,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof an arbitrary https
site by letting a browser obtain a valid certificate from this site
during one request, and then sending the browser a crafted 502
response page upon a subsequent request.
