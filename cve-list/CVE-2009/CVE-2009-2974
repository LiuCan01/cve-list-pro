Google Chrome 1.0.154.65, 1.0.154.48, and earlier allows remote
attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (application hang) via
vectors involving a chromehtml: URI value for the document.location
property or (2) cause a denial of service (application hang and CPU
consumption) via vectors involving a series of function calls that set
a chromehtml: URI value for the document.location property.
