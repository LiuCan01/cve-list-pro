Multiple integer overflows in glyphs-eimage.c in XEmacs 21.4.22, when
running on Windows, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) the tiff_instantiate
function processing a crafted TIFF file, (2) the png_instantiate
function processing a crafted PNG file, and (3) the jpeg_instantiate
function processing a crafted JPEG file, all which trigger a
heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: the provenance of this information
is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party
information.
