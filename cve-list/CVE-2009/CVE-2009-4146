The _rtld function in the Run-Time Link-Editor (rtld) in
libexec/rtld-elf/rtld.c in FreeBSD 7.1, 7.2, and 8.0 does not clear
the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, which allows local users to gain
privileges by executing a setuid or setguid program with a modified
LD_PRELOAD variable containing an untrusted search path that points to
a Trojan horse library, a different vector than CVE-2009-4147.
