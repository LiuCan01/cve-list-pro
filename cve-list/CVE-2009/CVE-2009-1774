Directory traversal vulnerability in plugins/ddb/foot.php in
Strawberry 1.1.1 allows remote attackers to include and execute
arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter to
example/index.php.  NOTE: this was originally reported as an issue
affecting the do parameter, but traversal with that parameter might
depend on a modified example/index.php.  NOTE: some of these details
are obtained from third party information.
