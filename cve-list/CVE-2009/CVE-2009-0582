The ntlm_challenge function in the NTLM SASL authentication mechanism
in camel/camel-sasl-ntlm.c in Camel in Evolution Data Server (aka
evolution-data-server) 2.24.5 and earlier, and 2.25.92 and earlier
2.25.x versions, does not validate whether a certain length value is
consistent with the amount of data in a challenge packet, which allows
remote mail servers to read information from the process memory of a
client, or cause a denial of service (client crash), via an NTLM
authentication type 2 packet with a length value that exceeds the
amount of packet data.
