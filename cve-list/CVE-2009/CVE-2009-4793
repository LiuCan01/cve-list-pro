Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in
adminpanel/scripts/addphotos.php in BandSite CMS 1.1.4 allows remote
authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code by
uploading a file with an executable extension via an addphotos action
to adminpanel/index.php, and then accessing the file via a direct
request with an images/gallery/ directory name.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
