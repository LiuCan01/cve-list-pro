Heap-based buffer overflow in Adobe Reader and Acrobat 7.x before
7.1.4, 8.x before 8.1.7, and 9.x before 9.2 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that triggers memory
corruption, as exploited in the wild in October 2009. NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
