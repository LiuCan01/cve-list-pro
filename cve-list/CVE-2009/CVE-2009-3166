token.cgi in Bugzilla 3.4rc1 through 3.4.1 places a password in a URL
at the beginning of a login session that occurs immediately after a
password reset, which allows context-dependent attackers to discover
passwords by reading (1) web-server access logs, (2) web-server
Referer logs, or (3) the browser history.
