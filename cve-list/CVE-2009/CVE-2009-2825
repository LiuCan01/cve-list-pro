Certificate Assistant in Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.2 does not
properly handle a '0' character in a domain name in the subject's
Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a
crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a
related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
