Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the wp_check_filetype
function in wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress before 2.8.6, when
a certain configuration of the mod_mime module in the Apache HTTP
Server is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code by posting an attachment with a multiple-extension
filename, and then accessing this attachment via a direct request to a
wp-content/uploads/ pathname, as demonstrated by a .php.jpg filename.
