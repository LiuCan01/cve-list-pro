The Smartqueue_og module 5.x before 5.x-1.3 and 6.x before
6.x-1.0-rc3, a module for Drupal, does not verify group-node
privileges in certain circumstances involving subqueue creation, which
allows remote authenticated users to discover arbitrary organic group
names by reading confirmation messages.
