Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 installs the Adobe Active File Monitor V8
service with an insecure security descriptor, which allows local users
to (1) stop the service via the stop command, (2) execute arbitrary
commands as SYSTEM by using the config command to modify the binPath
variable, or (3) restart the service via the start command.
