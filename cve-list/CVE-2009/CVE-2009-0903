IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0 before 7.0.0.3, and the
Feature Pack for Web Services for WAS 6.1 before 6.1.0.25, when a
WS-Security policy is established at the operation level, does not
properly handle inbound requests that lack a SOAPAction or
WS-Addressing Action, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions via a crafted request to a JAX-WS application.
