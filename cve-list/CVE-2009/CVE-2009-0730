Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the GigCalendar (com_gigcal)
component 1.0 for Mambo and Joomla!, when magic_quotes_gpc is
disabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
(1) the gigcal _venues_id parameter in a details action to index.php,
which is not properly handled by venuedetails.php, and (2) the
gigcal_bands_id parameter in a details action to index.php, which is
not properly handled by banddetails.php, different vectors than
CVE-2009-0726.
