Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.x and 6.x uses only
the portion of a filename before a ; (semicolon) character to
determine the file extension, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended extension restrictions of third-party upload applications via
a filename with a (1) .asp, (2) .cer, or (3) .asa first extension,
followed by a semicolon and a safe extension, as demonstrated by the
use of asp.dll to handle a .asp;.jpg file.
