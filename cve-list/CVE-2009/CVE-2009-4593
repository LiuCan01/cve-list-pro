The bftpdutmp_log function in bftpdutmp.c in Bftpd before 2.4 does not
place a '0' character at the end of the string value of the
ut.bu_host structure member, which might allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via unspecified vectors.
NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
