Argument injection vulnerability in Mail/sendmail.php in the Mail
package 1.1.14, 1.2.0b2, and possibly other versions for PEAR allows
remote attackers to read and write arbitrary files via a crafted
$recipients parameter, and possibly other parameters, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2009-4023.
