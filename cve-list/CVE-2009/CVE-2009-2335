WordPress and WordPress MU before 2.8.1 exhibit different behavior for
a failed login attempt depending on whether the user account exists,
which allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames.  NOTE: the
vendor reportedly disputes the significance of this issue, indicating
that the behavior exists for "user convenience."
