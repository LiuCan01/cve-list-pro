Integer overflow in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 SP3 and 2003 SP3
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PowerPoint
file containing a crafted record type for "collaboration information
for different slides" that contains a field that specifies a large
number of records, which triggers an under-allocated buffer and a
heap-based buffer overflow, aka "Integer Overflow Vulnerability."
