The DNS Resolver Cache Service (aka DNSCache) in Windows DNS Server in
Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, and Server 2008,
when dynamic updates are enabled, does not reuse cached DNS responses
in all applicable situations, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to predict transaction IDs and poison caches by
simultaneously sending crafted DNS queries and responses, aka "DNS
Server Query Validation Vulnerability."
