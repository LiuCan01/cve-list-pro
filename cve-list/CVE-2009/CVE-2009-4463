Intellicom NetBiter WebSCADA devices use default passwords for the
HICP network configuration service, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to modify network settings and cause a denial of service.
NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not
follow recommendations in the product's installation documentation.
NOTE: this issue was originally reported to be hard-coded passwords,
not default passwords.
