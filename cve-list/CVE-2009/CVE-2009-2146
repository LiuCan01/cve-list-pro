Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the Compose Email feature in
the Emails module in Sugar Community Edition (aka SugarCRM) before
5.2f allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by
uploading a file with only an extension in its name, then accessing
the file via a direct request to a modified filename under
cache/modules/Emails/, as demonstrated using .php as the entire
original name.
