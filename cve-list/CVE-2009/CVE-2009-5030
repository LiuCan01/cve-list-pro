Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/74851

The tcd_free_encode function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG 1.3 through 1.5
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tile
information in a Gray16 TIFF image, which causes insufficient memory
to be allocated and leads to an "invalid free."
