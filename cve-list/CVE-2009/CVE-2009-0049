Belgian eID middleware (eidlib) 2.6.0 and earlier does not properly
check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function,
which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate
chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys, a
similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.
