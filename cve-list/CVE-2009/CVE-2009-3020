win32k.sys in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) by referencing a
crafted .eot file in the src descriptor of an @font-face Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) rule in an HTML document, possibly related to the
Embedded OpenType (EOT) Font Engine, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2006-0010, CVE-2009-0231, and CVE-2009-0232.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
