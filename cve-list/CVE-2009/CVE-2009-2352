Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and earlier does not block javascript: URIs
in Refresh headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1)
injecting a Refresh header or (2) specifying the content of a Refresh
header, a related issue to CVE-2009-1312. NOTE: it was later reported
that 2.0.172.28, 2.0.172.37, and 3.0.193.2 Beta are also affected.
