Heap-based buffer overflow in the decoder_create function in the
initialization functionality in xvidcore/src/decoder.c in Xvid before
1.2.2, as used by Windows Media Player and other applications, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving the
DirectShow (aka DShow) frontend and improper handling of the
XVID_ERR_MEMORY return code during processing of a crafted movie file.
NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
