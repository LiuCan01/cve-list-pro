The Indexed Search Engine (indexed_search) system extension in TYPO3
4.0.0 through 4.0.9, 4.1.0 through 4.1.7, and 4.2.0 through 4.2.3
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted
filename containing shell metacharacters, which is not properly
handled by the command-line indexer.
