Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and earlier, 2.0.172.28, 2.0.172.37, and
3.0.193.2 Beta does not properly block data: URIs in Refresh headers
in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1) injecting a Refresh
header that contains JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html URI or
(2) entering a data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences when
specifying the content of a Refresh header.  NOTE: the JavaScript
executes outside of the context of the HTTP site.
