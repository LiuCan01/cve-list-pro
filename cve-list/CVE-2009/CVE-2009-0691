The Foxit JPEG2000/JBIG2 Decoder add-on before 2.0.2009.616 for Foxit
Reader 3.0 before Build 1817 does not properly handle a fatal error
during decoding of a JPEG2000 (aka JPX) header, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
PDF file that triggers an invalid memory access.
