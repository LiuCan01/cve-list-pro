Stack-based buffer overflow in the Intel Indeo41 codec for Windows
Media Player in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server
2003 SP2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted
compressed video data in an IV41 stream in a media file, leading to
many loop iterations, as demonstrated by data in an AVI file.
