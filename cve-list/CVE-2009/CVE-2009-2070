Opera displays a cached certificate for a (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT
response page returned by a proxy server, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof an arbitrary https site by
letting a browser obtain a valid certificate from this site during one
request, and then sending the browser a crafted 502 response page upon
a subsequent request.
