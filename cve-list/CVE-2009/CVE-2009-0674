images/captcha.php in Raven Web Services RavenNuke 2.30, when
register_globals and display_errors are enabled, allows remote
attackers to determine the existence of local files by sending
requests with full pathnames in the aFonts array parameter, and then
observing the error messages, which differ between existing and
nonexistent pathnames.
