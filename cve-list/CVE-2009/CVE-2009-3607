Reference: XF:poppler-createsurfacefromthumbnaildata-bo(53801)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/53801

Integer overflow in the create_surface_from_thumbnail_data function in
glib/poppler-page.cc in Poppler 0.x allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary
code via a crafted PDF document that triggers a heap-based buffer
overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
