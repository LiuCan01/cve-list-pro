WebKit in Apple Safari before 4.0, iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1, and
iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1 does not prevent web sites
from loading third-party content into a subframe, which allows remote
attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct "clickjacking"
attacks via a crafted HTML document.
