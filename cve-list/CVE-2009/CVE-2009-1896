The Java Web Start framework in IcedTea in OpenJDK before
1.6.0.0-20.b16.fc10 on Fedora 10, and before 1.6.0.0-27.b16.fc11 on
Fedora 11, trusts an entire application when at least one of the
listed jar files is trusted, which allows context-dependent attackers
to execute arbitrary code without the untrusted-code restrictions via
a crafted application, related to NetX.
