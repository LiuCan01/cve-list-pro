The Word processor in OpenOffice.org 1.1.2 through 1.1.5 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted (1) .doc, (2) .wri, or (3) .rtf Word 97
file that triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild in
December 2008, as demonstrated by 2008-crash.doc.rar, and a similar
issue to CVE-2008-4841.
