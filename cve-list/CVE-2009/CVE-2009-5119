The default configuration of Apache Tomcat in Websense Manager in
Websense Web Security 7.0 and Web Filter 7.0 enables weak SSL ciphers
in conf/server.xml, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network and then
conducting a brute-force attack against encrypted session data.
