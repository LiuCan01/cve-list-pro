Buffer overflow in the "create torrent dialog" functionality in
uTorrent 1.8.3 build 15772, and possibly other versions before 1.8.3
(Build 16010), allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
a text file containing a large string.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
