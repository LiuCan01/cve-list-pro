Integer overflow in Apple CoreGraphics, as used in Safari before
4.0.3, Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12, and Mac OS X 10.4.11 and 10.5.8,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long text run that
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow during font glyph rendering, a
related issue to CVE-2009-1194.
