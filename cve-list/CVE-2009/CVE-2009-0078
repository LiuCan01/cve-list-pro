The Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider in Microsoft
Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, Vista Gold and SP1,
and Server 2008 does not properly implement isolation among a set of
distinct processes that (1) all run under the NetworkService account
or (2) all run under the LocalService account, which allows local
users to gain privileges by accessing the resources of one of the
processes, aka "Windows WMI Service Isolation Vulnerability."
