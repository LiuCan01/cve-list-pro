The popen API function in TSRM/tsrm_win32.c in PHP before 5.2.11 and
5.3.x before 5.3.1, when running on certain Windows operating systems,
allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via a crafted (1) "e" or (2) "er" string in the second
argument (aka mode), possibly related to the _fdopen function in the
Microsoft C runtime library. NOTE: this might not cross privilege
boundaries except in rare cases in which the mode argument is
accessible to an attacker outside of an application that uses the
popen function.
