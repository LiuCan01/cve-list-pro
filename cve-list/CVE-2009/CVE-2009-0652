The Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) blacklist in Mozilla Firefox
3.0.6 and other versions before 3.0.9; Thunderbird before 2.0.0.21;
and SeaMonkey before 1.1.15 does not include box-drawing characters,
which allows remote attackers to spoof URLs and conduct phishing
attacks, as demonstrated by homoglyphs of the / (slash) and ?
(question mark) characters in a subdomain of a .cn domain name, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0233.  NOTE: some third parties
claim that 3.0.6 is not affected, but much older versions perhaps are
affected.
