Unspecified vulnerability in the Secure Enterprise Search component in
Oracle Database 10.1.8.3 allows remote attackers to affect integrity
via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from
the July 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from an
established researcher that this is cross-site scripting (XSS) via the
search_p_groups parameter in search/query/search.
