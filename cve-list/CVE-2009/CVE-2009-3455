Apple Safari, possibly before 4.0.3, on Mac OS X does not properly
handle a '0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate
issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to
CVE-2009-2408.
