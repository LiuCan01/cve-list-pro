The Certificate Authority Proxy Function (CAPF) service in Cisco
Unified Communications Manager 5.x before 5.1(3e) and 6.x before
6.1(3) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (voice
service outage) by sending malformed input over a TCP session in which
the "client terminates prematurely."
