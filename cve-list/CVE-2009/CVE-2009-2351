Opera 9.52 and earlier does not block javascript: URIs in Refresh
headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1)
injecting a Refresh header or (2) specifying the content of a Refresh
header, a related issue to CVE-2009-1312. NOTE: it was later reported
that 10.00 Beta 3 Build 1699 is also affected.
