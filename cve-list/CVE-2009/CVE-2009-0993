Unspecified vulnerability in the OPMN component in Oracle Application
Server 10.1.2.3 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous
information was obtained from the April 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not
commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is a format
string vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via format string specifiers in an HTTP POST URI, which are not
properly handled when logging to opmn/logs/opmn.log.
