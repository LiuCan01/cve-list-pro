The command line interface in Overland Storage Snap Server 410 with
GuardianOS 5.1.041 runs the "less" utility with a higher-privileged
uid than the CLI user and without sufficient restriction on shell
escapes, which allows local users to gain privileges using the "!"
character within less to access a privileged shell.
