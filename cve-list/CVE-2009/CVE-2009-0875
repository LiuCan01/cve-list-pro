Race condition in the Doors subsystem in the kernel in Sun Solaris 8
through 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_94, allows local users to cause
a denial of service (process hang), or possibly bypass file
permissions or gain kernel-context privileges, via vectors involving
the time at which control is transferred from a caller to a door
server.
