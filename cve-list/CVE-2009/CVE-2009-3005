Lunascape 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 allows remote attackers to spoof the address
bar, via window.open with a relative URI, to show an arbitrary URL on
the web site visited by the victim, as demonstrated by a visit to an
attacker-controlled web page, which triggers a spoofed login form for
the site containing that page.  NOTE: a related attack was reported in
which an arbitrary file: URL is shown.
