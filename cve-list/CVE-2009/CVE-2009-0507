IBM WebSphere Process Server (WPS) 6.1.2 before 6.1.2.3 and 6.2 before
6.2.0.1 does not properly restrict configuration data during an export
of the cluster configuration file from the administrative console,
which allows remote authenticated users to obtain the (1) JMSAPI, (2)
ESCALATION, and (3) MAILSESSION (aka mail session) cleartext passwords
via vectors involving access to a cluster member.
