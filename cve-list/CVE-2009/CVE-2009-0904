The IBM Stax XMLStreamWriter in the Web Services component in IBM
WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1 before 6.1.0.25 does not
properly process XML encoding, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions and possibly modify data via "XML fuzzing
attacks" sent through SOAP requests.
