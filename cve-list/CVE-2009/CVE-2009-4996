** DISPUTED **

Xfce4-session 4.5.91 in Xfce does not lock the screen when the suspend
or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for
physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a
resume action, a related issue to CVE-2010-2532.  NOTE: there is no
general agreement that this is a vulnerability, because separate
control over locking can be an equally secure, or more secure,
behavior in some threat environments.
