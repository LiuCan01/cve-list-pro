Cisco ACE XML Gateway (AXG) and ACE Web Application Firewall (WAF)
before 6.1 allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via
an HTTP request that lacks a handler, as demonstrated by (1) an
OPTIONS request or (2) a crafted GET request, leading to a
Message-handling Errors message containing a certain client intranet
IP address, aka Bug ID CSCtb82159.
