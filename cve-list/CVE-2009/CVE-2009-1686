WebKit in Apple Safari before 4.0, iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1, and
iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1 does not properly handle
constant (aka const) declarations in a type-conversion operation
during JavaScript exception handling, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption
and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.
