The SessionAdapter::ExchangeHandlerImpl::checkAlternate function in
broker/SessionAdapter.cpp in the C++ Broker component in Apache Qpid
before 0.6, as used in Red Hat Enterprise MRG before 1.3 and other
products, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference, daemon crash, and cluster outage)
by attempting to modify the alternate of an exchange.
