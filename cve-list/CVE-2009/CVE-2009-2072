Apple Safari does not require a cached certificate before displaying a
lock icon for an https web site, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof an arbitrary https site by sending the browser a
crafted (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT response page for an https request
sent through a proxy server.
