libpng before 1.2.37 does not properly parse 1-bit interlaced images
with width values that are not divisible by 8, which causes libpng to
include uninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG file and might
allow remote attackers to read portions of sensitive memory via
"out-of-bounds pixels" in the file.
