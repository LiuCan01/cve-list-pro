Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4, when IP-based tunnels and the Cisco
Express Forwarding feature are enabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (device reload) via a malformed packet that
is not properly handled during switching from one tunnel to a second
tunnel, aka Bug IDs CSCsh97579 and CSCsq31776.
