The NFS daemon (aka nfsd) in Sun Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris before
snv_106, when NFSv3 is used, does not properly implement combinations
of security modes, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions and read or modify files, as demonstrated by a
combination of the sec=sys and sec=krb5 security modes, related to
modes that "override each other."
