The EditCSVAction function in cgi/actions.py in Roundup 1.2 before
1.2.1, 1.4 through 1.4.6, and possibly other versions does not
properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users
with edit or create privileges for a class to modify arbitrary items
within that class, as demonstrated by editing all queries, modifying
settings, and adding roles to users.
