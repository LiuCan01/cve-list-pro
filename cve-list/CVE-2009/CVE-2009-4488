** DISPUTED ** Varnish 2.0.6 writes data to a log file without
sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote
attackers to modify a window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary
commands or overwrite files, via an HTTP request containing an escape
sequence for a terminal emulator.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the
significance of this report, stating that "This is not a security
problem in Varnish or any other piece of software which writes a
logfile. The real problem is the mistaken belief that you can cat(1) a
random logfile to your terminal safely."
