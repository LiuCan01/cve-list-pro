Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the AudioCodecs library in the
CoreAudio component in Apple iPhone OS before 3.1, and iPhone OS
before 3.1.1 for iPod touch, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a
crafted (1) AAC or (2) MP3 file, as demonstrated by a ringtone with
malformed entries in the sample size table.
