Unspecified vulnerability in the Network Authentication component in
Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 and 10.2.0.4 allows remote attackers to
affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown
vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October
2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from an independent
researcher that this is related to improper validation of the
AUTH_SESSKEY parameter length that leads to arbitrary code execution.
