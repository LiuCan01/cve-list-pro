Off-by-one error in src/http.c in CoreHTTP 0.5.3.1 and earlier allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
arbitrary code via an HTTP request with a long first line that
triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this vulnerability reportedly exists
because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2007-4060.
