The Workplace (aka WP) component in IBM FileNet P8 Application Engine
(P8AE) 4.0.2.x before 4.0.2.2-P8AE-FP002 grants a document's
Creator-Owner full control over an annotation object, even if the
default instance security has changed, which might allow remote
authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions in
opportunistic circumstances.
