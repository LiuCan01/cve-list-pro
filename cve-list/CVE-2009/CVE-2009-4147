The _rtld function in the Run-Time Link-Editor (rtld) in
libexec/rtld-elf/rtld.c in FreeBSD 7.1 and 8.0 does not clear the (1)
LD_LIBMAP, (2) LD_LIBRARY_PATH, (3) LD_LIBMAP_DISABLE, (4) LD_DEBUG,
and (5) LD_ELF_HINTS_PATH environment variables, which allows local
users to gain privileges by executing a setuid or setguid program with
a modified variable containing an untrusted search path that points to
a Trojan horse library, different vectors than CVE-2009-4146.
