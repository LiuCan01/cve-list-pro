** DISPUTED **

Google Chrome 1.0.154.43 allows remote attackers to trick a user into
visiting an arbitrary URL via an onclick action that moves a crafted
element to the current mouse position, related to a "Clickjacking"
vulnerability.  NOTE: a third party disputes the relevance of this
issue, stating that "every sufficiently featured browser is and likely
will remain susceptible to the behavior known as clickjacking," and
adding that the exploit code "is not a valid demonstration of the
issue."
