Google Chrome detects http content in https web pages only when the
top-level frame uses https, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
to execute arbitrary web script, in an https site's context, by
modifying an http page to include an https iframe that references a
script file on an http site, related to
"HTTP-Intended-but-HTTPS-Loadable (HPIHSL) pages."
