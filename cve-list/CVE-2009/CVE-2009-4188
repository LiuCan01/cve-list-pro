HP Operations Dashboard has a default password of j2deployer for the
j2deployer account, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a session that uses the manager role to conduct unrestricted
file upload attacks against the /manager servlet in the Tomcat servlet
container.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2009-3098.
