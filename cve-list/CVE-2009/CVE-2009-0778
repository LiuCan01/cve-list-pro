The icmp_send function in net/ipv4/icmp.c in the Linux kernel before
2.6.25, when configured as a router with a REJECT route, does not
properly manage the Protocol Independent Destination Cache (aka DST)
in some situations involving transmission of an ICMP Host Unreachable
message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(connectivity outage) by sending a large series of packets to many
destination IP addresses within this REJECT route, related to an
"rt_cache leak."
