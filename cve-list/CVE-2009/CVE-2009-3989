Bugzilla before 3.0.11, 3.2.x before 3.2.6, 3.4.x before 3.4.5, and
3.5.x before 3.5.3 does not block access to files and directories that
are used by custom installations, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via requests for (1) CVS/, (2) contrib/,
(3) docs/en/xml/, (4) t/, or (5) old-params.txt.
