Directory traversal vulnerability in the OBEX FTP Service in the
Microsoft Bluetooth stack in Windows Mobile 6 Professional, and
probably Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC and 5.0 for Pocket PC Phone
Edition, allows remote authenticated users to list arbitrary
directories, and create or read arbitrary files, via a .. (dot dot) in
a pathname.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing
to a Startup folder.
