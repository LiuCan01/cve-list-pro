The originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket function in
avahi-core/server.c in avahi-daemon 0.6.23 does not account for the
network byte order of a port number when processing incoming multicast
packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(network bandwidth and CPU consumption) via a crafted legacy unicast
mDNS query packet that triggers a multicast packet storm.
