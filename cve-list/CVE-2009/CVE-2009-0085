The Secure Channel (aka SChannel) authentication component in
Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2,
Vista Gold and SP1, and Server 2008, when certificate authentication
is used, does not properly validate the client's key exchange data in
Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake messages, which allows remote
attackers to spoof authentication by crafting a TLS packet based on
knowledge of the certificate but not the private key, aka "SChannel
Spoofing Vulnerability."
