Stack-based buffer overflow in the PowerPoint 4.2 conversion filter
(PP4X32.DLL) in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, and
2003 SP3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large
number of structures in sound data in a file that uses a PowerPoint
4.0 native file format, leading to memory corruption, aka "Legacy File
Format Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-0222,
CVE-2009-0223, CVE-2009-0226, and CVE-2009-1137.
