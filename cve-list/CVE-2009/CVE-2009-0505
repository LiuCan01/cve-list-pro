The CICS listener in IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms 6.2 GA waits for
a forcepurge acknowledgement from the CICS Application Server (CICSAS)
after an eci response timeout, which might allow remote authenticated
users to cause a denial of service (forcepurge handling delay), or
have unspecified other impact, via vectors involving slow or
nonexistent acknowledgement.
