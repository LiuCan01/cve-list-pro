The Staging Webservice ("sitecore modules/staging/service/api.asmx")
in Sitecore Staging Module 5.4.0 rev.080625 and earlier allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication and (1) upload files, (2) download
files, (3) list directories, and (4) clear the server cache via
crafted SOAP requests with arbitrary Username and Password values,
possibly related to a direct request.
