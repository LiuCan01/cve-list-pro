Array index error in the SMBv2 protocol implementation in srv2.sys in
Microsoft Windows Vista Gold, SP1, and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold
and SP2, and Windows 7 RC allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code or cause a denial of service (system crash) via an & (ampersand)
character in a Process ID High header field in a NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL
REQUEST packet, which triggers an attempted dereference of an
out-of-bounds memory location, aka "SMBv2 Negotiation Vulnerability."
