Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13 and earlier, 3.5, 3.6 a1 pre, and 3.7 a1 pre
does not properly block data: URIs in Location headers in HTTP
responses, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1) injecting a
Location header that contains JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html
URI or (2) entering a data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences
when specifying the content of a Location header.  NOTE: the JavaScript
executes outside of the context of the HTTP site.
