A certain ActiveX control in the Indexing Service in Microsoft Windows
2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP2 does not properly
process URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
programs via unspecified vectors that cause a "vulnerable binary" to
load and run, aka "Memory Corruption in Indexing Service
Vulnerability."
