Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13 and earlier, 3.5, 3.6 a1 pre, and 3.7 a1 pre;
SeaMonkey 1.1.17; and Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier do not properly block
data: URIs in Refresh headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote
attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors
related to (1) injecting a Refresh header that contains JavaScript
sequences in a data:text/html URI or (2) entering a data:text/html URI
with JavaScript sequences when specifying the content of a Refresh
header.  NOTE: in some product versions, the JavaScript executes
outside of the context of the HTTP site.
