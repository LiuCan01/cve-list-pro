Stack-based buffer overflow in the PowerPoint 4.2 conversion filter in
Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, and 2003 SP3 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in sound
data in a file that uses a PowerPoint 4.0 native file format, leading
to memory corruption, aka "Legacy File Format Vulnerability," a
different vulnerability than CVE-2009-0222, CVE-2009-0223,
CVE-2009-0227, and CVE-2009-1137.
