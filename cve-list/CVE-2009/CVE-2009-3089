IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.0 allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via
unspecified vectors, related to (1) the ibmslapd.exe daemon on Windows
and (2) the ibmdiradm daemon in the administration server on Linux, as
demonstrated by certain modules in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.11, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0717.  NOTE: as of 20090903, this
disclosure has no actionable information. However, because the
VulnDisco Pack author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being
assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
