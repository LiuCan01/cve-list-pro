Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP SP2 and SP3; 7 for Server
2003 SP2; 7 for Vista Gold, SP1, and SP2; and 7 for Server 2008 SP2
does not properly handle objects in memory, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by calling the setCapture method
on a collection of crafted objects, aka "Uninitialized Memory
Corruption Vulnerability."
