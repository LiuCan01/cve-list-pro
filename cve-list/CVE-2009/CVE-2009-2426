The connection_edge_process_relay_cell_not_open function in
src/or/relay.c in Tor 0.2.x before 0.2.0.35 and 0.1.x before
0.1.2.8-beta allows exit relays to have an unspecified impact by
causing controllers to accept DNS responses that redirect to an
internal IP address via unknown vectors.  NOTE: some of these details
are obtained from third party information.
