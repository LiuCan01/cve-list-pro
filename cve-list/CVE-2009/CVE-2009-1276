XScreenSaver in Sun Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris before snv_109, and
Solaris 8 and 9 with GNOME 2.0 or 2.0.2, allows physically proximate
attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading popup windows,
which are displayed even when the screen is locked, as demonstrated by
Thunderbird new-mail notifications.
