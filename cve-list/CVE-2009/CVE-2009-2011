Worldweaver DX Studio Player 3.0.29.0, 3.0.22.0, 3.0.12.0, and
probably other versions before 3.0.29.1, when used as a plug-in for
Firefox, does not restrict access to the shell.execute JavaScript API
method, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
via a .dxstudio file that invokes this method.
