Reference: BUGTRAQ:20091218 [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] PHP-Calendar <= v1.1 'configfile' Remote and Local File Inclusion vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/508548/100/0/threaded

Multiple absolute path traversal vulnerabilities in PHP-Calendar 1.1
allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files
via a full pathname in the configfile parameter to (1) update08.php or
(2) update10.php.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged
for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp,
ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
