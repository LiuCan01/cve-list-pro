Reference: MISC:http://secniche.org/papers/SNS_09_03_PDF_Silent_Form_Re_Purp_Attack.pdf

Google Chrome executes DOM calls in response to a javascript: URI in
the target attribute of a submit element within a form contained in an
inline PDF file, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended
Adobe Acrobat JavaScript restrictions on accessing the document
object, as demonstrated by a web site that permits PDF uploads by
untrusted users, and therefore has a shared document.domain between
the web site and this javascript: URI.  NOTE: the researcher reports
that Adobe's position is "a PDF file is active content."
