Opera before 10.00 does not properly handle a (1) '0' character or
(2) invalid wildcard character in a domain name in the subject's
Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a
crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
