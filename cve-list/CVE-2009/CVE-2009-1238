Race condition in the HFS vfs sysctl interface in XNU 1228.8.20 and
earlier on Apple Mac OS X 10.5.6 and earlier allows local users to
cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption) by simultaneously
executing the same HFS_SET_PKG_EXTENSIONS code path in multiple
threads, which is problematic because of lack of mutex locking for an
unspecified global variable.
