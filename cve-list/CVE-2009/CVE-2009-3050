Buffer overflow in the set_page_size function in util.cxx in HTMLDOC
1.8.27 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long MEDIA SIZE comment.  NOTE: it was later
reported that there were additional vectors in htmllib.cxx and
ps-pdf.cxx using an AFM font file with a long glyph name, but these
vectors do not cross privilege boundaries.
