The NET_TCP_LISTEN function in net.c in Zabbix Agent before 1.6.7,
when running on FreeBSD or Solaris, allows remote attackers to bypass
the EnableRemoteCommands setting and execute arbitrary commands via
shell metacharacters in the argument to net.tcp.listen.  NOTE: this
attack is limited to attacks from trusted IP addresses.
