Stack-based buffer overflow in the flattenIncrementally function in
flatten.c in xcftools 1.0.4, as reachable from the (1) xcf2pnm and (2)
xcf2png utilities, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
image that causes a conversion to a location "above or to the left of
the canvas." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
