Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 5.x
before 5.18 and 6.x before 6.12 allow (1) remote authenticated users
to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted UTF-8 byte
sequences that are treated as UTF-7 by Internet Explorer 6 and 7,
which are not properly handled in the "HTML exports of books" feature;
and (2) allow remote authenticated users with administer taxonomy
permissions to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the help text
of an arbitrary vocabulary.  NOTE: vector 1 exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1575.
