Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.4.4 grants ticket access on
the basis of single-digit substrings of the CustomerID value, which
allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access
restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by visiting a ticket, as
demonstrated by leveraging the CustomerID 12 account to read tickets
that should be available only to CustomerID 1 or CustomerID 2.
