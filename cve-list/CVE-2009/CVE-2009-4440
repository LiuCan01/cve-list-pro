Directory Proxy Server (DPS) in Sun Java System Directory Server
Enterprise Edition 6.0 through 6.3.1 does not properly handle multiple
client connections within a short time window, which allows remote
attackers to hijack the backend connection of an authenticated user,
and obtain the privileges of this user, by making a client connection
in opportunistic circumstances, related to "long binds," aka Bug Ids
6828462 and 6823593.
