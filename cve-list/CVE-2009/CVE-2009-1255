The process_stat function in (1) Memcached before 1.2.8 and (2)
MemcacheDB 1.2.0 discloses (a) the contents of /proc/self/maps in
response to a stats maps command and (b) memory-allocation statistics
in response to a stats malloc command, which allows remote attackers
to obtain sensitive information such as the locations of memory
regions, and defeat ASLR protection, by sending a command to the
daemon's TCP port.
