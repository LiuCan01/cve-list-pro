Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Print (aka Printer,
e-mail and PDF versions) module 5.x before 5.x-4.7 and 6.x before
6.x-1.7, a module for Drupal, allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML by modifying a document head, before the
Content-Type META element, to contain crafted UTF-8 byte sequences
that are treated as UTF-7 by Internet Explorer 6 and 7, a related
issue to CVE-2009-1575.
