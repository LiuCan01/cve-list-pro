Stack-based buffer overflow in TIBCO SmartSockets before 6.8.2,
SmartSockets Product Family (aka RTworks) before 4.0.5, and Enterprise
Message Service (EMS) 4.0.0 through 5.1.1, as used in SmartSockets
Server and RTworks Server (aka RTserver), SmartSockets client
libraries and add-on products, RTworks libraries and components, EMS
Server (aka tibemsd), SmartMQ, iProcess Engine, ActiveMatrix products,
and CA Enterprise Communicator, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via "inbound data," as demonstrated by requests to the
UDP interface of the RTserver component, and data injection into the
TCP stream to tibemsd.
