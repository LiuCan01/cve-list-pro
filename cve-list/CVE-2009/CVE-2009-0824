Elaborate Bytes ElbyCDIO.sys 6.0.2.0 and earlier, as distributed in
SlySoft AnyDVD before 6.5.2.6, Virtual CloneDrive 5.4.2.3 and earlier,
CloneDVD 2.9.2.0 and earlier, and CloneCD 5.3.1.3 and earlier, uses
the METHOD_NEITHER communication method for IOCTLs and does not
properly validate a buffer associated with the Irp object, which
allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a
crafted IOCTL call.
