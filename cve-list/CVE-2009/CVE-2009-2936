** DISPUTED ** The Command Line Interface (aka Server CLI or
administration interface) in the master process in the reverse proxy
server in Varnish before 2.1.0 does not require authentication for
commands received through a TCP port, which allows remote attackers to
(1) execute arbitrary code via a vcl.inline directive that provides a
VCL configuration file containing inline C code; (2) change the
ownership of the master process via param.set, stop, and start
directives; (3) read the initial line of an arbitrary file via a
vcl.load directive; or (4) conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
attacks that leverage a victim's location on a trusted network and
improper input validation of directives.  NOTE: the vendor disputes
this report, saying that it is "fundamentally misguided and
pointless."
