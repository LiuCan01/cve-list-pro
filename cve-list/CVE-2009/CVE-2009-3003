Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 8 allows remote attackers to
spoof the address bar, via window.open with a relative URI, to show an
arbitrary URL on the web site visited by the victim, as demonstrated
by a visit to an attacker-controlled web page, which triggers a
spoofed login form for the site containing that page.
