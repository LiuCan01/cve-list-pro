XAMPP installs multiple packages with insecure default passwords,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via (1)
the "lampp" default password for the "nobody" account within the
included ProFTPD installation, (2) a blank default password for the
"root" account within the included MySQL installation, (3) a blank
default password for the "pma" account within the phpMyAdmin
installation, and possibly other unspecified passwords.  NOTE: this
was originally reported as a problem in DFLabs PTK, but this issue
affects any product that is installed within the XAMPP environment,
and should not be viewed as a vulnerability within that product.
NOTE: DFLabs states that PTK is intended for use in a laboratory with
"no contact from / to internet."
