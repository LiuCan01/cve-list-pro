Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, and 2003 SP3 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted sound data in a
file that uses a PowerPoint 4.0 native file format, leading to memory
corruption, aka "Legacy File Format Vulnerability," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2009-0222, CVE-2009-0223, CVE-2009-0226, and
CVE-2009-0227.
