The administrative web console on the TANDBERG Video Communication
Server (VCS) before X4.3 uses predictable session cookies in (1)
tandberg/web/lib/secure.php and (2) tandberg/web/user/lib/secure.php,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication,
and execute arbitrary code by loading a custom software update, via a
crafted "Cookie: tandberg_login=" HTTP header.
