Intel Q35, GM45, PM45 Express, Q45, and Q43 Express chipsets in the
SINIT Authenticated Code Module (ACM), which allows local users to
bypass the Trusted Execution Technology protection mechanism and gain
privileges by modifying the MCHBAR register to point to an
attacker-controlled region, which prevents the SENTER instruction from
properly applying VT-d protection while an MLE is being loaded.
