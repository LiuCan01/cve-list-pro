Armorlogic Profense Web Application Firewall before 2.2.22, and 2.4.x
before 2.4.4, does not properly implement the "positive model," which
allows remote attackers to bypass certain protection mechanisms via a
%0A (encoded newline), as demonstrated by a %0A in a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack URL.
