The ImageCache module 5.x before 5.x-2.5 and 6.x before
6.x-2.0-beta10, a module for Drupal, when the private file system is
used, does not properly perform access control for derivative images,
which allows remote attackers to view arbitrary images via a request
that specifies an image's filename.
