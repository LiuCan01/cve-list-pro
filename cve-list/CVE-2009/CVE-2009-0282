Integer overflow in Ralink Technology USB wireless adapter (RT73) 3.08
for Windows, and other wireless card drivers including rt2400, rt2500,
rt2570, and rt61, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Probe Request packet
with a long SSID, possibly related to an integer signedness error.
