The example code for the digest authentication functionality
(http_authentication.rb) in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.3 defines an
authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest block that returns nil
instead of false when the user does not exist, which allows
context-dependent attackers to bypass authentication for applications
that are derived from this example by sending an invalid username
without a password.
