The ATEN KH1516i IP KVM switch with firmware 1.0.063 and the KN9116 IP
KVM switch with firmware 1.1.104 do not (1) encrypt mouse events,
which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to perform mouse
operations on machines connected to the switch by injecting network
traffic; and do not (2) set the secure flag for the session cookie in
an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http
session.
