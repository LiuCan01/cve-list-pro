Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Mini-stream ASX to MP3
Converter 3.0.0.7 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
(1) a long rtsp URL in a .ram file and (2) a long string in the HREF
attribute of a REF element in a .asx file.  NOTE: the latter was also
subsequently reported in "prior to 3.1.3.7."
