Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 and earlier 3.0.x versions, when designMode is
enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and application crash) via a certain (a)
replaceChild or (b) removeChild call, followed by a (1)
queryCommandValue, (2) queryCommandState, or (3) queryCommandIndeterm
call.  NOTE: it was later reported that 3.0.6 and 3.0.7 are also
affected.
