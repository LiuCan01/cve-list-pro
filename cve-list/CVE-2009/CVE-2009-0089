Windows HTTP Services (aka WinHTTP) in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP
SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, and Vista Gold allows remote web
servers to impersonate arbitrary https web sites by using DNS spoofing
to "forward a connection" to a different https web site that has a
valid certificate matching its own domain name, but not a certificate
matching the domain name of the host requested by the user, aka
"Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability."
