Directory traversal vulnerability in gallery/comment.php in Enhanced
Simple PHP Gallery (ESPG) 1.72 allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter.  NOTE: the
vulnerability may be in my little homepage Comment script. If so, then
this should not be treated as a vulnerability in ESPG.
