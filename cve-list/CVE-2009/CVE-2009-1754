The PackageManagerService class in
services/java/com/android/server/PackageManagerService.java in Android
1.5 through 1.5 CRB42 does not properly check developer certificates
during processing of sharedUserId requests at an application's
installation time, which allows remote user-assisted attackers to
access application data by creating a package that specifies a shared
user ID with an arbitrary application.
