Stack-based buffer overflow in the URL Search Hook (ICQToolBar.dll) in
ICQ 6.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(persistent crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an Internet
shortcut .URL file containing a long URL parameter, which triggers a
crash when browsing a folder that contains this file.
