Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the web
administration interface in the Advanced Management Module (AMM) on
the IBM BladeCenter, including the BladeCenter H with BPET36H 54,
allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators,
as demonstrated by a power-off request to the
private/blade_power_action script.
