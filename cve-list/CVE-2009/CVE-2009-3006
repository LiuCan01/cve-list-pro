Maxthon Browser 2.5.3.80 UNICODE allows remote attackers to spoof the
address bar, via window.open with a relative URI, to show an arbitrary
URL on the web site visited by the victim, as demonstrated by a visit
to an attacker-controlled web page, which triggers a spoofed login
form for the site containing that page.
