kl1.sys in Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 9.0.0.463, and possibly other
versions before 9.0.0.736, does not properly validate input to IOCTL
0x0022c008, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(system crash) via IOCTL requests using crafted kernel addresses that
trigger memory corruption, possibly related to klavemu.kdl.
