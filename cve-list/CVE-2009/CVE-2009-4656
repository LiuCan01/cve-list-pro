Stack-based buffer overflow in E-Soft DJ Studio Pro 4.2 including
4.2.2.7.5, and 5.x including 5.1.4.3.1, allows user-assisted remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via a playlist file (.pls) containing
a long string.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
