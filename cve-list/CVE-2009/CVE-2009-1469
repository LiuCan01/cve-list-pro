CRLF injection vulnerability in the Forgot Password implementation in
server/webmail.php in IceWarp eMail Server and WebMail Server before
9.4.2 makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into
disclosing credentials via CRLF sequences preceding a Reply-To header
in the subject element of an XML document, as demonstrated by
triggering an e-mail message from the server that contains a user's
correct credentials, and requests that the user compose a reply that
includes this message.
