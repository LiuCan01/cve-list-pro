The DCERPC/NT dissector in Wireshark 0.10.10 through 1.0.9 and 1.2.0
through 1.2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a file that
records a malformed packet trace.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
