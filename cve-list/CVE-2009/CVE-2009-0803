SmoothWall SmoothGuardian, as used in SmoothWall Firewall,
NetworkGuardian, and SchoolGuardian 2008, when transparent
interception mode is enabled, uses the HTTP Host header to determine
the remote endpoint, which allows remote attackers to bypass access
controls for Flash, Java, Silverlight, and probably other
technologies, and possibly communicate with restricted intranet sites,
via a crafted web page that causes a client to send HTTP requests with
a modified Host header.
