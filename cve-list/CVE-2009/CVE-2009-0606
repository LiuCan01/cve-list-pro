The link_image function in linker/linker.c in the dynamic linker in
Bionic in Open Handset Alliance Android 1.0 on the T-Mobile G1 phone
does not properly handle file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 for a setgid
program, which allows local users to create arbitrary files owned by
certain groups, possibly a related issue to CVE-2002-0820.
