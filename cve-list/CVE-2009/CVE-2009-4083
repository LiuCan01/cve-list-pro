Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in e107 0.7.16 and
earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via unspecified vectors in (1) submitnews.php, (2) usersettings.php;
and (3) newpost.php, (4) banlist.php, (5) banner.php, (6) cpage.php,
(7) download.php, (8) users_extended.php, (9) frontpage.php, (10)
links.php, and (11) mailout.php in e107_admin/.  NOTE: this may overlap
CVE-2004-2040 and CVE-2006-4794, but there are insufficient details to
be certain.
