Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the sajax_get_common_js
function in php/Sajax.php in Sajax 0.12 allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the URL parameter, which is
not properly handled when using browsers that do not URL-encode
requests, such as Internet Explorer 6.  NOTE: the provenance of this
