IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1 through 6.1.0.24 and 7.0
through 7.0.0.4, IBM WebSphere Portal Server 5.1 through 6.0, and IBM
Integrated Solutions Console (ISC) 6.0.1 do not properly set the
IsSecurityEnabled security flag during migration of WebSphere Member
Manager (WMM) to Virtual Member Manager (VMM) and a Federated
Repository, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information
from repositories via unspecified vectors.
