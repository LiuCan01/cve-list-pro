Mozilla Firefox 3.5.2 on Windows XP, in some situations possibly
involving an incompletely configured protocol handler, does not
properly implement setting the document.location property to a value
specifying a protocol associated with an external application, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) via vectors involving a series of function calls that set
this property, as demonstrated by (1) the chromehtml: protocol and (2)
the aim: protocol.
