Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in TBDev.NET 01-01-08 allow
remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct
phishing attacks via (1) the returnto parameter to login.php or (2)
the returnto parameter in a delete action to news.php.  NOTE: this can
be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) by redirecting to a data:
URI.
