WebVPN on the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) device with
software 8.0(4), 8.1.2, and 8.2.1 does not properly distinguish its
own login screen from the login screens it produces for third-party
(1) FTP and (2) CIFS servers, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to trick a user into sending WebVPN credentials to an
arbitrary server via a URL associated with that server, aka Bug ID
CSCsy80709.
