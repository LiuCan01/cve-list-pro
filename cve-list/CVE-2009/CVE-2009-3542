Directory traversal vulnerability in ls.php in LittleSite (aka LS or
LittleSite.php) 0.1 allows remote attackers to include and execute
arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter to
index.php.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for
remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps,
or ssh2.sftp URL.
