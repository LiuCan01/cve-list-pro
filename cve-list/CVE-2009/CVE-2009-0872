The NFS server in Sun Solaris 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_111, does
not properly implement the AUTH_NONE (aka sec=none) security mode in
combination with other security modes, which allows remote attackers
to bypass intended access restrictions and read or modify files, as
demonstrated by a combination of the AUTH_NONE and AUTH_SYS security
modes.
