Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 does not properly handle objects
in memory that (1) were not properly initialized or (2) are deleted,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors
involving a call to the getElementsByTagName method for the STYLE tag
name, selection of the single element in the returned list, and a
change to the outerHTML property of this element, related to Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and mshtml.dll, aka "HTML Object Memory Corruption
Vulnerability." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information. NOTE: this issue was originally assigned
CVE-2009-4054, but Microsoft assigned a duplicate identifier of
CVE-2009-3672. CVE consumers should use this identifier instead of
CVE-2009-4054.
