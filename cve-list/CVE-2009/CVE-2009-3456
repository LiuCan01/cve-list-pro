Google Chrome, possibly 3.0.195.21 and earlier, does not properly
handle a '0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate
issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to
CVE-2009-2408.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown;
the details are obtained solely from third party information.
