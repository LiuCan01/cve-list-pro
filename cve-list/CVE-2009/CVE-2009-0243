Microsoft Windows does not properly enforce the Autorun and
NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry values, which allows physically proximate
attackers to execute arbitrary code by (1) inserting CD-ROM media, (2)
inserting DVD media, (3) connecting a USB device, and (4) connecting a
Firewire device; (5) allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by mapping a network drive; and allows user-assisted
attackers to execute arbitrary code by clicking on (6) an icon under
My ComputerDevices with Removable Storage and (7) an option in an
AutoPlay dialog, related to the Autorun.inf file.  NOTE: vectors 1 and
3 on Vista are already covered by CVE-2008-0951.
