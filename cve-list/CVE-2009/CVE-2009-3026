protocols/jabber/auth.c in libpurple in Pidgin 2.6.0, and possibly
other versions, does not follow the "require TLS/SSL" preference when
connecting to older Jabber servers that do not follow the XMPP
specification, which causes libpurple to connect to the server without
the expected encryption and allows remote attackers to sniff sessions.
