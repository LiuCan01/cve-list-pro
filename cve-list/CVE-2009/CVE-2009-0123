Unspecified vulnerability in Apple Safari on Mac OS X 10.5 and Windows
allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files on a client machine
via vectors related to the association of Safari with the (1) feed,
(2) feeds, and (3) feedsearch URL types for RSS feeds.  NOTE: as of
20090114, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory. However,
because it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE
identifier for tracking purposes.
