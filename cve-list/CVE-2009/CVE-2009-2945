weblogin/login.fcgi (aka the WebLogin login script) in Stanford
University WebAuth 3.5.5, 3.6.0, and 3.6.1 places passwords in URLs in
certain circumstances involving conversion of a POST request to a GET
request, which allows context-dependent attackers to discover
passwords by reading (1) web-server access logs, (2) web-server
Referer logs, or (3) the browser history.
