Unspecified vulnerability in Drupal 5.x before 5.17 and 6.x before
6.11, as used in vbDrupal before 5.17.0, allows user-assisted remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information by tricking victims into
visiting the front page of the site with a crafted URL and causing
form data to be sent to an attacker-controlled site, possibly related
to multiple / (slash) characters that are not properly handled by
includes/bootstrap.inc, as demonstrated using the search box.  NOTE:
this vulnerability can be leveraged to conduct cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) attacks.
