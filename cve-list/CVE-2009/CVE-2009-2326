Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in KerviNet Forum 1.1 and
earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
(1) an enter_parol cookie to index.php in an auto action or (2) the
topic parameter to message.php.  NOTE: vector 2 can be leveraged for a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
