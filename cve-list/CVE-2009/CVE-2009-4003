Multiple integer overflows in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.6.606
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an
unspecified block type in a Shockwave file, leading to a heap-based
buffer overflow; and might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via (2) an unspecified 3D block in a Shockwave file, leading to
memory corruption; or (3) a crafted 3D model in a Shockwave file,
leading to heap memory corruption.
