_functions.php in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9, sends a
redirect but does not exit when it is called directly, which allows
remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism to conduct remote
file inclusion and directory traversal attacks, execute arbitrary PHP
code, or read arbitrary files via the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, a
different vector than CVE-2003-1500.
