Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in FCKeditor before
2.6.4.1 allow remote attackers to create executable files in arbitrary
directories via directory traversal sequences in the input to
unspecified connector modules, as exploited in the wild for remote
code execution in July 2009, related to the file browser and the
editor/filemanager/connectors/ directory.
