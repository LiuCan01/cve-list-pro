The Over-the-Air Provisioning (OTAP) functionality on Cisco Aironet
Lightweight Access Point 1100 and 1200 devices does not properly
implement access-point association, which allows remote attackers to
spoof a controller and cause a denial of service (service outage) via
crafted remote radio management (RRM) packets, aka "SkyJack" or Bug ID
CSCtb56664.
