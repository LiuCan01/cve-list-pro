Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in TWiki before 4.3.2
allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary
users for requests that update pages, as demonstrated by a URL for a
save script in the ACTION attribute of a FORM element, in conjunction
with a call to the submit method in the onload attribute of a BODY
element.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an insufficient fix for
CVE-2009-1339.
