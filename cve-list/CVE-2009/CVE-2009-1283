glFusion before 1.1.3 performs authentication with a user-provided
password hash instead of a password, which allows remote attackers to
gain privileges by obtaining the hash and using it in the glf_password
cookie, aka "User Masquerading." NOTE: this can be leveraged with a
separate SQL injection vulnerability to steal hashes.
