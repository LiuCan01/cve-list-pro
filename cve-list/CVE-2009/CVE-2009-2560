Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Wireshark 1.2.0 allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a file
that records a malformed packet trace and is processed by the (1)
Bluetooth L2CAP, (2) RADIUS, or (3) MIOP dissector. NOTE: it was later
reported that the RADIUS issue also affects 0.10.13 through 1.0.9.
