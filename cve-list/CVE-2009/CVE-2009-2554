SQL injection vulnerability in the search method in jobline.class.php
in Jobline (com_jobline) 1.1.2.2, 1.3.1, and possibly earlier
versions, a component for Joomla!, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the search parameter in a results action to
index.php, which invokes the search method from the searchJobPostings
function in jobline.php.
