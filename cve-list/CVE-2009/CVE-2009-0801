Squid, when transparent interception mode is enabled, uses the HTTP
Host header to determine the remote endpoint, which allows remote
attackers to bypass access controls for Flash, Java, Silverlight, and
probably other technologies, and possibly communicate with restricted
intranet sites, via a crafted web page that causes a client to send
HTTP requests with a modified Host header.
