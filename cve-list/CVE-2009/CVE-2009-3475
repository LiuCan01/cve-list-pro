Internet2 Shibboleth Service Provider software 1.3.x before 1.3.3 and
2.x before 2.2.1, when using PKIX trust validation, does not properly
handle a '0' character in the subject or subjectAltName fields of a
certificate, which allows remote man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
