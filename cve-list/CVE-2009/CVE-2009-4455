The default configuration of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliance (Cisco ASA) 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 allows portal
traffic to access arbitrary backend servers, which might allow remote
authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and access
unauthorized web sites via a crafted URL obfuscated with ROT13 and a
certain encoding.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported as a
vulnerability related to lack of restrictions to URLs listed in the
Cisco WebVPN bookmark component, but the vendor states that "The
bookmark feature is not a security feature."
