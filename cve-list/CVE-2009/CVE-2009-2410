The local_handler_callback function in
server/responder/pam/pam_LOCAL_domain.c in sssd 0.4.1 does not
properly handle blank-password accounts in the SSSD BE database, which
allows context-dependent attackers to obtain access by sending the
account's username, in conjunction with an arbitrary password, over an
ssh connection.
