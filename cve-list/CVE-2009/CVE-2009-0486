Bugzilla 3.2.1, 3.0.7, and 3.3.2, when running under mod_perl, calls
the srand function at startup time, which causes Apache children to
have the same seed and produce insufficiently random numbers for
random tokens, which allows remote attackers to bypass cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms and conduct unauthorized
activities as other users.
