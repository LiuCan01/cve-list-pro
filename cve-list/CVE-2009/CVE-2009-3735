The ActiveScan Installer ActiveX control in as2stubie.dll before
1.3.3.0 in PandaActiveScan Installer 2.0 in Panda ActiveScan downloads
software in an as2guiie.cab archive located at an arbitrary URL, and
does not verify the archive's digital signature before installation,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URL
argument to an unspecified method.
