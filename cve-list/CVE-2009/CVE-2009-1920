The JScript scripting engine 5.1, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8 in JScript.dll in
Microsoft Windows, as used in Internet Explorer, does not properly
load decoded scripts into memory before execution, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site that
triggers memory corruption, aka "JScript Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability."
