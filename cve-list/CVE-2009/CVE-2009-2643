Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the PDF distiller in the
Attachment Service component in Research In Motion (RIM) BlackBerry
Enterprise Server (BES) software 4.1.3 through 5.0 and BlackBerry
Professional Software 4.1.4 allow user-assisted remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted .pdf file attachment, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2008-3246 and CVE-2009-0219.
