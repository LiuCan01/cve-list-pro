** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in TYPO3 4.0 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the showUid parameter.
NOTE: the TYPO3 Security Team disputes this report, stating that
"there is no such vulnerability... The showUid parameter is generally
used in third-party TYPO3 extensions - not in TYPO3 Core."
