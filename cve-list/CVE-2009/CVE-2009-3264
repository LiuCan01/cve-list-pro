The getSVGDocument method in Google Chrome before 3.0.195.21 omits an
unspecified "access check," which allows remote web servers to bypass
the Same Origin Policy and conduct cross-site scripting attacks via
unknown vectors, related to a user's visit to a different web server
that hosts an SVG document.
