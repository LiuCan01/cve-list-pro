The console selection feature in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 before
2.6.28.4, 2.6.25, and possibly earlier versions, when the UTF-8 console
is used, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) by selecting a small number of 3-byte UTF-8
characters, which triggers an "off-by-two memory error." NOTE: it is not
clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.
