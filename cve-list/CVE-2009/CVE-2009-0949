The ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.10
does not properly initialize memory for IPP request packets, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and daemon crash) via a scheduler request with two
consecutive IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags.
