src/network/ssl/qsslcertificate.cpp in Nokia Trolltech Qt 4.x does not
properly handle a '0' character in a domain name in the Subject
Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a
crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a
related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
