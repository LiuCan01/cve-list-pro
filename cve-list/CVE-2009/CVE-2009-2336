The forgotten mail interface in WordPress and WordPress MU before
2.8.1 exhibits different behavior for a password request depending on
whether the user account exists, which allows remote attackers to
enumerate valid usernames.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the
significance of this issue, indicating that the behavior exists for
"user convenience."
