The default configuration of Apache Tomcat in Websense Manager in
Websense Web Security 7.0 and Web Filter 7.0 allows connections to TCP
port 1812 from arbitrary source IP addresses, which makes it easier
for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
UTF-7 text to the 404 error page of a Project Woodstock service on
this port.
