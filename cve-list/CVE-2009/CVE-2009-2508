The single sign-on implementation in Active Directory Federation
Services (ADFS) in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 and Server 2008
Gold and SP2 does not properly remove credentials at the end of a
network session, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain
the credentials of a previous user of the same web browser by using
data from the browser's cache, aka "Single Sign On Spoofing in ADFS
Vulnerability."
