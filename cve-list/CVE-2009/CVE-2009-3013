Opera 9.52 and earlier, and 10.00 Beta 3 Build 1699, does not properly
block data: URIs in Location headers in HTTP responses, which allows
remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
vectors related to (1) injecting a Location header that contains
JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html URI or (2) entering a
data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences when specifying the
content of a Location header.  NOTE: the JavaScript executes outside of
the context of the HTTP site.
