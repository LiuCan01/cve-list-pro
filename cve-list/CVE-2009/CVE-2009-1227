** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.

Buffer overflow in the PKI Web Service in Check Point Firewall-1 PKI
Web Service allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long (1)
Authorization or (2) Referer HTTP header to TCP port 18624.  NOTE: the
vendor has disputed this issue, stating "Check Point Security Alert
Team has analyzed this report. We've tried to reproduce the attack on
all VPN-1 versions from NG FP2 and above with and without HFAs. The
issue was not reproduced. We have conducted a thorough analysis of the
relevant code and verified that we are secure against this attack. We
consider this attack to pose no risk to Check Point customers."  In
addition, the original researcher, whose reliability is unknown as of
20090407, also states that the issue "was discovered during a pen-test
where the client would not allow further analysis."
