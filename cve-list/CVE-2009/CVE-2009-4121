Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
Quick.CMS 2.4 and Quick.CMS.Lite 2.4 allow remote attackers to hijack
the authentication of the administrator for requests that (1) delete
web pages via a p-delete action to admin.php, and possibly (2) delete
products or (3) delete orders via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
