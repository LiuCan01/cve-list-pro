** DISPUTED ** NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.

FileZilla 2.2.14b and 2.2.15, and possibly earlier versions, when "Use
secure mode" is disabled, uses a weak encryption scheme to store the
user's password in the configuration settings file, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed
the issue, stating that "the problem is not a vulnerability at all,
but in fact a fundamental issue of every single program that can store
passwords transparently."
