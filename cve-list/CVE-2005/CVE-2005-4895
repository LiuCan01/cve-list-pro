Reference: MISC:http://kqueue.org/blog/2012/03/05/memory-allocator-security-revisited/
Reference: CONFIRM:http://code.google.com/p/gperftools/source/browse/tags/perftools-0.4/ChangeLog

Multiple integer overflows in TCMalloc (tcmalloc.cc) in gperftools
before 0.4 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform
memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size
value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.
