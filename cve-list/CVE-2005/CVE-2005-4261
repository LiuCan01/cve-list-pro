Unspecified vulnerability in Positive Software Corporation CP+
(cpplus) before 2.5.5 allows attackers to have unknown impact and
attack vectors, related to "a possible security flaw caused by a bug
in Perl." NOTE: unless CP+ includes its own copy of Perl with
CVE-2005-3962, this is a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-3962;
however, there is insufficient information to be sure.
