SQL injection vulnerability in the favorites module in index.php in
IPBProArcade 2.5.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL
commands via the gameid parameter.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
party information. In addition, the demonstration code as used by
third parties suggests that this might be a different type of
vulnerability related to shell metacharacters.  Finally, this could be
a rediscovery of CVE-2004-1430.
