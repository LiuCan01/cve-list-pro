Sun Java JRE 1.1.x through 1.4.x writes temporary files with long
filenames that become predictable on a file system that uses 8.3 style
short names, which allows remote attackers to write arbitrary files to
known locations and facilitates the exploitation of vulnerabilities in
applications that rely on unpredictable file names.
