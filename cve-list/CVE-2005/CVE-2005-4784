Multiple buffer overflows in the POSIX readdir_r function, as used in
multiple packages, allow local users to cause a denial of service and
possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a symlink attack that exploits
a race condition between opendir and pathcon calls and changes the
filesystem to one with a larger maximum directory-entry name length,
or (2) possibly via programmer-introduced errors on operating systems
with a small struct dirent, such as Solaris or BeOS, as demonstrated
in packages including (a) gcj, (b) KDE, (c) libwww, (d) the Rudiments
library, (e) teTeX, (f) xmail, (g) bfbtester, (h) ncftp, (i) netwib,
(j) OpenOffice.org, (k) Pike, (l) reprepro, (m) Tcl, and (n) xgsmlib.
