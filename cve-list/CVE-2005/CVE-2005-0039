Certain configurations of IPsec, when using Encapsulating Security
Payload (ESP) in tunnel mode, integrity protection at a higher layer,
or Authentication Header (AH), allow remote attackers to decrypt IPSec
communications by modifying the outer packet in ways that cause
plaintext data from the inner packet to be returned in ICMP messages,
as demonstrated using bit-flipping attacks and (1) Destination Address
Rewriting, (2) a modified header length that causes portions of the
packet to be interpreted as IP Options, or (3) a modified protocol
field and source address.
