Race condition in the xpcom library, as used by web browsers such as
Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, and Galeon, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) via a large HTML file
that loads a DOM call from within nested DIV tags, which causes part
of the currently rendering page and referenced objects to be deleted.
