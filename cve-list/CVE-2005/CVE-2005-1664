The __VIEWSTATE functionality in Microsoft ASP.NET 1.x allows remote
attackers to conduct replay attacks to (1) apply a ViewState generated
from one view to a different view, (2) reuse ViewState information
after the application's state has changed, or (3) use the ViewState to
conduct attacks or expose content to third parties.
