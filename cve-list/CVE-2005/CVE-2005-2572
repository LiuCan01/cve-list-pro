MySQL, when running on Windows, allows remote authenticated users with
insert privileges on the mysql.func table to cause a denial of service
(server hang) and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a request
for a non-library file, which causes the Windows LoadLibraryEx
function to block, or (2) a request for a function in a library that
has the XXX_deinit or XXX_init functions defined but is not tailored
for mySQL, such as jpeg1x32.dll and jpeg2x32.dll.
