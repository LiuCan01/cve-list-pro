The Logfile feature in Yahoo! Messenger 5.x through 6.0 can be
activated by a YMSGR: URL and writes all output to a single ypager.log
file, even when there are multiple users, and does not properly warn
later users that the feature has been enabled, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information from other users.
