Macromedia Flash plugin (1) Flash.ocx 7.0.19.0 (Windows) and earlier
and (2) libflashplayer.so before 7.0.25.0 (Unix) allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via parameters to the ActionDefineFunction ActionScript
call in a SWF file, which causes an improper memory access condition,
a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2628.
