The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in NEC
UNIVERGE IX1000, IX2000, and IX3000 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted IKE
packets, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for
IKEv1. NOTE: due to the lack of details in the advisory, it is unclear
which of CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or CVE-2005-3668 this issue
applies to.
