Format string vulnerability in the log function in Net::Server 0.87
and earlier, as used in Postfix Greylisting Policy Server (Postgrey)
1.18 and earlier, and possibly other products, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) via format string specifiers that
are not properly handled before being sent to syslog, as demonstrated
using sender addresses to Postgrey.
