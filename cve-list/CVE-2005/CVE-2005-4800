Direct static code injection vulnerability in Yet Another PHP Image
Gallery (YaPIG) 0.95b and earlier allows remote authenticated
administrators to inject arbitrary PHP code via the TestGallery
parameter in a mod_info action to modify_gallery.php, which inserts
the code into guid_info.php.  NOTE: this issue is easier to exploit
due to a separate CSRF vulnerability.
