** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in server_privileges.php in phpMyAdmin
2.7.0 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the (1) dbname and (2) checkprivs parameters.  NOTE: the
vendor and a third party have disputed this issue, saying that the
main task of the program is to support query execution by
authenticated users, and no external attack scenario exists without an
auto-login configuration.  Thus it is likely that this issue will be
REJECTED.  However, a closely related CSRF issue has been assigned
CVE-2005-4450.
