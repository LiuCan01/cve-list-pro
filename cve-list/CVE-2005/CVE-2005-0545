Microsoft Windows XP Pro SP2 and Windows 2000 Server SP4 running
Active Directory allow local users to bypass group policies that
restrict access to hidden drives by using the browse feature in Office
10 applications such as Word or Excel, or using a flash drive.  NOTE:
this issue has been disputed in a followup post.
