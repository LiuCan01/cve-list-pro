** DISPUTED **

JavaMail API 1.1.3 through 1.3, as used by Apache Tomcat 5.0.16,
allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a full pathname in
the argument to the Download parameter.  NOTE: Sun and Apache dispute
this issue.  Sun states: "The report makes references to source code
and files that do not exist in the mentioned products."
