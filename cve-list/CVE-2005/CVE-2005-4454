Validate-before-filter vulnerability in cleanhtml.pl 1.129 in
LiveJournal CVS before Dec 7 2005, when the cleancss option is
enabled, allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks via a "" (backslash) within a "javascript" scheme in a style
property (such as "javascript"), which bypasses the "javascript"
check before the "" is stripped and then rendered in web browsers
that allow scripting in style sheets.
