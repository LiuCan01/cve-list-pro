Interpretation conflict in YaBB before 2.1 allows remote authenticated
users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via HTML in a file with a
GIF file extension, which causes the HTML to be executed by a victim
who views the file in Internet Explorer as a result of CVE-2005-3312.
NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a design
flaw in Internet Explorer and the proper fix should be in that
browser; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in
YaBB.
