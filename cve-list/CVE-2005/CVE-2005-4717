Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows NT 4.0 SP6a, Windows 2000
SP4, Windows XP SP1, Windows XP SP2, and Windows Server 2003 SP1
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client crash)
via a certain combination of a malformed HTML file and a CSS file that
triggers a null dereference, probably related to rendering of a DIV
element that contains a malformed IMG tag, as demonstrated by
IEcrash.htm and IEcrash.rar.
