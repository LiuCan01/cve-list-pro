Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the Internet Key Exchange
version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in multiple Cisco products allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reset) via
certain malformed IKE packets, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP
Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due to the lack of details in the Cisco
advisory, it is unclear which of CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or
CVE-2005-3668 this issue applies to.
