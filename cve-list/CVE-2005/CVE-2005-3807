Memory leak in the VFS file lease handling in locks.c in Linux kernels
2.6.10 to 2.6.15 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion) via certain Samba activities that cause an fasync
entry to be re-allocated by the fcntl_setlease function after the
fasync queue has already been cleaned by the locks_delete_lock
function.
