Race condition in Microsoft Internet Explorer allows user-assisted
attackers to overwrite arbitrary files and possibly execute code by
tricking a user into performing a drag-and-drop action from certain
objects, such as file objects within a folder view, then predicting
the drag action, and re-focusing to a malicious window.
