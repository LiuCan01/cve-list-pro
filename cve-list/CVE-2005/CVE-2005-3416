phpBB 2.0.17 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled and the
session_start function has not been called to handle a session, allows
remote attackers to bypass security checks by setting the $_SESSION
and $HTTP_SESSION_VARS variables to strings instead of arrays, which
causes an array_merge function call to fail.
