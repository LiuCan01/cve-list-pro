Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in vTiger
CRM 4.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to read or include
arbitrary files, an ultimately execute arbitrary PHP code, via .. (dot
dot) and null byte ("%00") sequences in the (1) module parameter and
(2) action parameter in the Leads module, as also demonstrated by
injecting PHP code into log messages and accessing the log file.
