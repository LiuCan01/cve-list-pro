The "Upload new image" command in the "Manage Images" eFiction 1.1,
when members are allowed to upload images, allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a filename with a .php
extension that contains a GIF header, which passes the image validity
check but executes any PHP code within the file.
