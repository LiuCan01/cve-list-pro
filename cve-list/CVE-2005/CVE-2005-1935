Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1935
Phase: Assigned (20050609)
Category: SF
Reference: MISC:http://www.phreedom.org/solar/exploits/msasn1-bitstring/
Reference: XF:asn1-constructed-heap-overflow(20870)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/20870

Heap-based buffer overflow in the BERDecBitString function in
Microsoft ASN.1 library (MSASN1.DLL) allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via nested constructed bit strings, which leads
to a realloc of a non-null pointer and causes the function to
overwrite previously freed memory, as demonstrated using a SPNEGO
token with a constructed bit string during HTTP authentication, and a
different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0818.  NOTE: the researcher has
claimed that MS:MS04-007 fixes this issue.
