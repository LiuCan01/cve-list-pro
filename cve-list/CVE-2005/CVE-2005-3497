** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in process_signup.php in PHP Handicapper
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the
serviceid parameter.  NOTE: on 20060210, the vendor disputed this
issue, saying "this is 100% false reporting, this is a slander
campaign from a customer who had a vulnerability in his SERVER not the
software."  However, followup investigation strongly suggests that the
original report is correct.
