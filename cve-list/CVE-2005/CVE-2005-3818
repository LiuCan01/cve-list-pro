Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in vTiger CRM 4.2
and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via (1) various input fields, including the contact, lead, and
first or last name fields, (2) the record parameter in a DetailView
action in the Leads module for index.php, (3) the $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']
variable, which is used in multiple locations such as index.php, and
(4) aggregated RSS feeds in the RSS aggregation module.
