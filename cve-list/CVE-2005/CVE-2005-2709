Reference: XF:kernel-sysctl-interface-dos(23040)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/23040

The sysctl functionality (sysctl.c) in Linux kernel before 2.6.14.1
allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel oops) and
possibly execute code by opening an interface file in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/, waiting until the interface is unregistered,
then obtaining and modifying function pointers in memory that was used
for the ctl_table.
