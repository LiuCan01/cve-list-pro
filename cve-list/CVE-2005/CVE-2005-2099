The Linux kernel before 2.6.12.5 does not properly destroy a keyring
that is not instantiated properly, which allows local users or remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel oops) via a keyring
with a payload that is not empty, which causes the creation to fail,
leading to a null dereference in the keyring destructor.
