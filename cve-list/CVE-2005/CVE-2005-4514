** DISPUTED **

The encapsulation script mechanism in Webwasher CSM Appliance Suite
5.x uses case-sensitive detection of malicious tokens, which allows
attackers to bypass script detection by using tokens that can be upper
or lower case.  NOTE: the vendor has stated that this problem could
not be reproduced, and has asked the researcher for more information,
without a response as of 20060103.
