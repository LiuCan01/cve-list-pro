** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Fidra Lighthouse CMS 1.1.0
and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the search parameter in a query_string to the home page.
NOTE: The vendor disputes this issue, saying "Lighthouse does not in
any way make use of the PHP technology.  [It] is an application server
... A technology like this cannot be susceptible to client-side
cross-site-scripting-attacks on its own, but only applications created
based on such a technology. This does not only apply to Lighthouse,
but also to Perl, PHP or web applications based on Java Servlet
technology."  Since the original researcher is known to test demo
pages and is sometimes inaccurate, it is likely that this issue will
be REJECTED.
