Heap-based buffer overflow in the embedded player in multiple
RealNetworks products and versions including RealPlayer 10.x, RealOne
Player, and Helix Player allows remote malicious servers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
chunked Transfer-Encoding HTTP response in which either (1) the chunk
header length is specified as -1, (2) the chunk header with a length
that is less than the actual amount of sent data, or (3) a missing
chunk header.
