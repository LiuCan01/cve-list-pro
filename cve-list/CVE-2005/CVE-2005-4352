The securelevels implementation in NetBSD 2.1 and earlier, and Linux
2.6.15 and earlier, allows local users to bypass time setting
restrictions and set the clock backwards by setting the clock ahead to
the maximum unixtime value (19 Jan 2038), which then wraps around to
the minimum value (13 Dec 1901), which can then be set ahead to the
desired time, aka "settimeofday() time wrap."
