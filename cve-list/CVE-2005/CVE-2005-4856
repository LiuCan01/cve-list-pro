The admin interface in eZ publish 3.5 before 3.5.7, 3.6 before 3.6.5,
3.7 before 3.7.3, and 3.8 before 20051110 does not properly handle
authorization errors, which allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information and see the admin pagelayout and associated
templates via a request with (1) "anything after the url" or (2) a
"wrong url".
