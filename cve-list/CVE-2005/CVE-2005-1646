The default installation of Fastream NETFile FTP/Web Server 7.4.6,
which supports FXP, does not require that the IP address in a PORT
command be the same as the IP of the logged in user, which allows
remote attackers to conduct FTP Bounce attacks to bypass firewall
rules or cause a denial of service.
