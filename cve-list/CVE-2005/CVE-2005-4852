The siteaccess URIMatching implementation in eZ publish 3.5 through
3.8 before 20050812 converts all non-alphanumeric characters in a URI
to '_' (underscore), which allows remote attackers to bypass access
restrictions by inserting certain characters in a URI, as demonstrated
by a request for /admin:de, which matches a rule allowing only
/admin_de to access /admin.
