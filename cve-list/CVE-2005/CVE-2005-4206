Blackboard Learning and Community Portal System in Academic Suite
6.3.1.424, 6.2.3.23, and other versions before 6 allows remote
attackers to redirect users to other URLs and conduct phishing attacks
via a modified url parameter to frameset.jsp, which loads the URL into
a frame and causes it to appear to be part of a valid page.
