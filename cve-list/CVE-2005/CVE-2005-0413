Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in MyPHP Forum 1.0 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the fid in
forum.php, (2) the member parameter in member.php, (3) the email
parameter in forgot.php, or (4) the nbuser or nbpass parameters in
include.php.  NOTE: it was later reported that vector 2 exists in 3.0
and earlier.
