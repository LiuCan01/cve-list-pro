The administration protocol for Kerio WinRoute Firewall 6.x up to
6.0.10, Personal Firewall 4.x up to 4.1.2, and MailServer up to 6.0.8
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
via certain attacks that force the product to "compute unexpected
conditions" and "perform cryptographic operations."
