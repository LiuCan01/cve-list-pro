The HTML rendering engine in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 allows
remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
HTML in corrupted images and other files such as .GIF, JPG, and WAV,
which is rendered as HTML when the user clicks on the link, even
though the web server response and file extension indicate that it
should be treated as a different file type.
