Reference: MLIST:[secure-testing-announce] 20050828 [DTSA-6-1] New cgiwrap packages fix multiple vulnerabilities
Reference: URL:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/secure-testing-announce/2005-August/000003.html

The CGIwrap program before 3.9 on Debian GNU/Linux uses an incorrect
minimum value of 100 for a UID to determine whether it can perform a
seteuid operation, which could allow attackers to execute code as
other system UIDs that are greater than the minimum value, which
should be 1000 on Debian systems.
