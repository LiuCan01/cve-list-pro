Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Unix/Linux File Servers 5.0-5 uses
world-writable permissions for the (1) log and (2) license directory,
which allows local users to delete log files, append to arbitrary
files via a symlink attack on kavmonitor.log, or delete license keys
and prevent keepup2date from properly executing.
