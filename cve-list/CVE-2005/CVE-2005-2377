nss_ldap 181 to versions before 213, as used in Mandrake Corporate
Server and Mandrake 10.0, and other operating systems, does not
properly handle a SIGPIPE signal when sending a search request to an
LDAP directory server, which might allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crond and other application crash) if they can
cause an LDAP server to become unavailable.  NOTE: it is not clear
whether this attack scenario is sufficient to include this item in
CVE.
