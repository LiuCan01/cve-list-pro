Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the example web
applications for Jakarta Tomcat 5.5.6 and earlier allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1)
el/functions.jsp, (2) el/implicit-objects.jsp, and (3)
jspx/textRotate.jspx in examples/jsp2/, as demonstrated via script in
a request to snp/snoop.jsp.  NOTE: other XSS issues in the manager
were simultaneously reported, but these require admin access and do
not cross privilege boundaries.
