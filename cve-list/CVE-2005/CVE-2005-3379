Multiple interpretation error in Trend Micro (1) PC-Cillin 2005
12.0.1244 with the 7.510.1002 engine and (2) OfficeScan 7.0 with the
7.510.1002 engine allows remote attackers to bypass virus scanning via
a file such as BAT, HTML, and EML with an "MZ" magic byte sequence
which is normally associated with EXE, which causes the file to be
treated as a safe type that could still be executed as a dangerous
file type by applications on the end system, as demonstrated by a
"triple headed" program that contains EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka
the "magic byte bug."
