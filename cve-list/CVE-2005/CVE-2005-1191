The Web View DLL (webvw.dll), as used in Windows Explorer on Windows
2000 systems, does not properly filter an apostrophe ("'") in the
author name in a document, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary
script via extra attributes when Web View constructs a mailto: link
for the preview pane when the user selects the file.
