** DISPUTED ** Buffer overflow in mIRC 5.91, 6.03, 6.12, and 6.16
allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long string that is
entered after reaching the DCC Get Folder Dialog.  NOTE: this issue
has been disputed by the vendor, saying "as far as I can tell, this is
neither an exploit nor a vulnerability. The above report describes a
local bug in mIRC."  It could be that this is only exploitable by the
user of the application, and thus would not cross privilege boundaries
unless under an otherwise restrictive environment such as a kiosk.
