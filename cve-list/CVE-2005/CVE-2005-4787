** DISPUTED **

Turnkey Web Tools SunShop Shopping Cart allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via a phpinfo action to (1) index.php,
(2) admin/index.php, and (3) admin/adminindex.php, which executes the
PHP phpinfo function.  NOTE: The vendor has disputed this issue,
saying that "Having this in the code makes it easier for us to
troubleshoot when issues arise on individual carts. For someone to
have a script to do this type of search would require that they know
where your shop is actually located. I dont think it really can be
construde [sic] as a security issue."
