** SPLIT ** The jlucaller program in LiveUpdate for Symantec Norton
AntiVirus 9.0.3 on Macintosh runs setuid when executing Java programs,
which allows local users to gain privileges.  NOTE: due to a CNA
error, this candidate was also originally assigned to an issue in
DiskMountNotify.  Use CVE-2005-3270 for the DiskMountNotify issue, and
CVE-2005-2759 for the LiveUpdate issue.
