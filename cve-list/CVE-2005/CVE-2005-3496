Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in PHP Handicapper allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the msg
parameter to msg.php.  NOTE: some sources identify a second vector in
the login parameter to process_signup.php, but the original source
says that it is for CRLF injection (CVE-2005-4712).  Also note: the
vendor has disputed CVE-2005-3497, and it is possible that the dispute
was intended to include this issue as well.  If so, followup
investigation strongly suggests that the original report is correct.
