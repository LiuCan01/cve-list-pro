Heap-based buffer overflow in the get_bhead function in readfile.c in
Blender BlenLoader 2.0 through 2.40pre allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a .blend file with a negative bhead.len value,
which causes less memory to be allocated than expected, possibly due
to an integer overflow.
