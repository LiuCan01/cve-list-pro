** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in FishCart 3.1 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) cartid
parameter to upstnt.php or (2) psku parameter to display.php.  NOTE:
the vendor disputes this report, saying that they are forced SQL
errors.  The original researcher is known to be unreliable.
