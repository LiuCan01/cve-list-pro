Trend Micro ServerProtect EarthAgent for Windows Management Console
5.58 and possibly earlier versions, when running with Trend Micro
Control Manager 2.5 and 3.0, and Damage Cleanup Server 1.1, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a
flood of crafted packets with a certain "magic value" to port 5005,
which also leads to a memory leak.
