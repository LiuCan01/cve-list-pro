Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in FishCart 3.1 allow
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1)
trackingnum, (2) reqagree, or (3) m parameter to upstracking.php or
(4) nlst parameter to display.php.  NOTE: the vendor was not able to
reproduce some of the reported vectors but believes that they have
been addressed.  The original researcher is known to be unreliable.
