Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in ZipGenius 5.5.1.468 and
6.0.2.1041, and other versions before 6.0.2.1050, allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a ZIP archive that
contains a file with a long filename, which is not properly handled by
(a) zipgenius.exe, (b) zg.exe, (c) zgtips.dll, and (d) contmenu.dll;
(2) a long original name in a (a) UUE, (b) XXE, or (c) MIM file, which
is not properly handled by zipgenius.exe; or (3) an ACE archive with a
file with a long filename, which is not properly handled by
unacev2.dll.
