Reference: BUGTRAQ:20050822 SQL Injection and PHP Code Injection Vulnerabilities in PHPKit 1.6.1
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=112474427221031&w=2

Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in admin/admin.php in PHPKit
1.6.1 allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary
PHP code by uploading a .php file to the content/images/ directory
using images.php.  NOTE: if a PHPKit administrator must already have
access to the end system to install or modify configuration of the
product, then this issue might not cross privilege boundaries, and
should not be included in CVE.
