Buffer overflow in the "Add to archive" command in WinRAR 3.51 allows
user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code by tricking the user into adding a
file whose filename contains a non-default code page and non-ANSI
characters, as demonstrated using a Chinese filename, possibly due to
buffer expansion when using the WideCharToMultiByte API.  NOTE: it is
not clear whether this problem can be exploited for code execution.
If not, then perhaps the user-assisted nature of the attack should
exclude the issue from inclusion in CVE.
