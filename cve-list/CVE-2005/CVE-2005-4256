Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in forum.asp in ASP-DEV XM
Forum RC3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the forum_title parameter.  NOTE: the provenance of this
issue is unknown; the details are obtained solely from the BID.  In
addition, its accuracy is in question because "forum_title" does not
appear to be specified in the source code for XM Forum RC3.  It is
possible, but not certain, that this is CVE-2004-2211.
