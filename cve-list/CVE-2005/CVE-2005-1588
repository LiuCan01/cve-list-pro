** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in index.php for Quick.cart 0.3.0 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the iCategory
parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has privately disputed this issue, saying
that Quick.cart does not even use SQL and therefore can not be
vulnerable to SQL injection.
