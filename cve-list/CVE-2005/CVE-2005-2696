Reference: BUGTRAQ:20050820 IBM Lotus Notes multiple disclosures of password hashes
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=112456040418543&w=2
Reference: MISC:http://www.venera.com/downloads/Lotus_password_disclosures.pdf

IBM Lotus Notes does not properly restrict access to password hashes
in the Notes Address Book (NAB), which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via the (1) password digest field in the
Administration tab of a Lotus Notes client, (2) "PasswordDigest" and
"HTTPPassword" fields in the document properties in the NAB, or (3) a
direct query to the Domino LDAP server, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2005-2428.
