Interpretation conflict in Fortinet FortiGate 2.8, running FortiOS
2.8MR10 and v3beta, allows remote attackers to bypass the URL blocker
via an (1) HTTP request terminated with a line feed (LF) and not
carriage return line feed (CRLF) or (2) HTTP request with no Host
field, which is still processed by most web servers without violating
RFC2616.
