IBM WebSphere Application Server 6.0 and earlier, when sharing the
document root of the web server, allows remote attackers to obtain the
source code for Java Server Pages (.jsp) via an HTTP request with an
invalid Host header, which causes the page to be processed by the web
server instead of the JSP engine.
