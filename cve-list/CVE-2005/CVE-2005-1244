** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in the third party tool from NetIQ,
as used to secure the iSeries AS/400 FTP server, allows remote
attackers to access arbitrary files, including those from qsys.lib,
via ".." sequences in a GET request.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed
this issue, saying that "neither NetIQ Security Manager nor our
iSeries Security Solutions are vulnerable."
