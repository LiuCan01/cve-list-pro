The YMSGR URL handler in Yahoo! Messenger 5.x through 6.0 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disconnect) via a room
login or a room join request packet with a third : (colon) and an &
(ampersand), which causes Messenger to send a corrupted packet to the
server, which triggers a disconnect from the server.
