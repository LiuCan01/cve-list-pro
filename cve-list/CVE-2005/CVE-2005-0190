Directory traversal vulnerability in RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040) and
earlier allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via a Real
Metadata Packages (RMP) file with a FILENAME tag containing .. (dot
dot) sequences in a filename that ends with a ? (question mark) and an
allowed file extension (e.g. .mp3), which bypasses the check for the
file extension.
