Cisco IOS 12.0 to 12.4 might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a heap-based buffer overflow in system timers.
NOTE: this issue does not correspond to a specific vulnerability,
rather a general weakness that only increases the feasibility of
exploitation of any vulnerabilities that might exist.  Such
design-level weaknesses normally are not included in CVE, so perhaps
this issue should be REJECTed.
