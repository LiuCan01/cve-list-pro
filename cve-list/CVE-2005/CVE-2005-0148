Reference: XF:thunderbird-javascript-handler-launch(19173)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/19173

Thunderbird before 0.9, when running on Windows systems, uses the
default handler when processing javascript: links, which invokes
Internet Explorer and may expose the Thunderbird user to
vulnerabilities in the version of Internet Explorer that is installed
on the user's system.  NOTE: since the invocation between multiple
products is a common practice, and the vulnerabilities inherent in
multi-product interactions are not easily enumerable, this issue might
be REJECTED in the future.
