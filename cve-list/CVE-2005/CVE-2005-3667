Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in multiple unspecified
implementations of Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) have
multiple unspecified attack vectors and impacts related to denial of
service, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.
NOTE: due to the lack of information in the original sources, it is
likely that this candidate will be REJECTed once it is known which
implementations are actually vulnerable.  In addition, since "denial
of service" is an impact and not a vulnerability, it is unknown which
underlying vulnerabilities are actually covered by this particular
candidate.
