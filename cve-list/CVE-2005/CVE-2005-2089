Microsoft IIS 5.0 and 6.0 allows remote attackers to poison the web
cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS
attacks via an HTTP request with both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
header and a Content-Length header, which causes IIS to incorrectly
handle and forward the body of the request in a way that causes the
receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP request, aka "HTTP
Request Smuggling."
