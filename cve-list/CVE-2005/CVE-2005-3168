The SECEDIT command on Microsoft Windows 2000 before Update Rollup 1
for SP4, when using a security template to set Access Control Lists
(ACLs) on folders, does not apply ACLs on folders that are listed
after a long folder entry, which could result in less secure
permissions than specified by the template.
