The Downloads page in MAXdev MD-Pro 1.0.73, and possibly earlier
versions, uses an incomplete blacklist to check for dangerous file
extensions, which could allow remote attackers to bypass file
extension checks and execute arbitrary commands by uploading a file
with a different extension, as demonstrated using .inc files.
