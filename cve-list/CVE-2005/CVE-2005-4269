mshtml.dll in Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003, and Internet Explorer
6.0 SP1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (access
violation) by causing mshtml.dll to process button-focus events at the
same time that a document is reloading, as seen in Microsoft Office
InfoPath 2003 by repeatedly clicking the "Delete" button in a
repeating section in a form.  NOTE: the normal operation of InfoPath
appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries, so
this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath.  If no realistic
scenarios exist for this problem in other products, then perhaps it
should be excluded from CVE.
