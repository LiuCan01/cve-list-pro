Reference: MISC:http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/mtpbugs-adv.txt

Integer signedness error in certain older versions of the NeL library,
as used in Mtp-Target 1.2.2 and earlier, and possibly other products,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption or server crash) via a negative value in a STLport call,
which is not caught by a signed comparison.
