PNP_GetDeviceList (upnp_getdevicelist) in UPnP for Microsoft Windows
2000 SP4 and earlier, and possibly Windows XP SP1 and earlier, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via
a DCE RPC request that specifies a large output buffer size, a variant
of CVE-2006-6296, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2120.
