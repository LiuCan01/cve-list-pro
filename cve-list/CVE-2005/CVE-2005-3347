Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in
phpSysInfo 2.4 and earlier, as used in phpgroupware 0.9.16 and
earlier, and egrouwpware before 1.0.0.009, allow remote attackers to
include arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences in the (1)
sensor_program parameter or the (2) _SERVER[HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE]
parameter, which overwrites an internal variable, a variant of
CVE-2003-0536.  NOTE: due to a typo in an advisory, an issue in osh
was inadvertently linked to this identifier; the proper identifier for
the osh issue is CVE-2005-3346.
