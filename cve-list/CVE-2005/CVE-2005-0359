The Legato PortMapper in EMC Legato NetWorker, Sun Solstice Backup 6.0
and 6.1, and StorEdge Enterprise Backup 7.0 through 7.2 does not
restrict access to the pmap_set and pmap_unset commands, which allows
remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service by using pmap_unset
to un-register a NetWorker service, or (2) obtain sensitive
information from NetWorker services by using pmap_set to register a
new service.
