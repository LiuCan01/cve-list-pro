The management interface for Siemens SANTIS 50 running firmware
4.2.8.0, and possibly other products including Ericsson HN294dp and
Dynalink RTA300W, allows remote attackers to access the Telnet port
without authentication via certain packets to the web interface that
cause the interface to freeze.
