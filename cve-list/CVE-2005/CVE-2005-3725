Zyxel P2000W Version 1 VOIP WIFI Phone Wj.00.10 uses hardcoded IP
addresses for its DNS servers, which could allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or hijack Zyxel phones by attacking or
spoofing the hardcoded DNS servers.  NOTE: it could be argued that
this issue reflects an inherent limitation of DNS itself, so perhaps
it should not be included in CVE.
