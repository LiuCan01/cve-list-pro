Secure Shell (SSH) 2 in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.3 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) (1) via a
username that contains a domain name when using a TACACS+ server to
authenticate, (2) when a new SSH session is in the login phase and a
currently logged in user issues a send command, or (3) when IOS is
logging messages and an SSH session is terminated while the server is
sending data.
