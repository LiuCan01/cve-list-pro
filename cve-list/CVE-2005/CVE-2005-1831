** DISPUTED **

Sudo 1.6.8p7 on SuSE Linux 9.3, and possibly other Linux
distributions, allows local users to gain privileges by using sudo to
call su, then entering a blank password and hitting CTRL-C. NOTE: SuSE
and multiple third-party researchers have not been able to replicate
this issue, stating "Sudo catches SIGINT and returns an empty string
for the password so I don't see how this could happen unless the
user's actual password was empty."
