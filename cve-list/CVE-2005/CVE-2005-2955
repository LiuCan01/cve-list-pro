Reference: MISC:http://rgod.altervista.org/atutor151.html

config.inc.php in ATutor 1.5.1, and possibly earlier versions, uses an
incomplete blacklist to check for dangerous file extensions, which
allows authenticated administrators or educators to execute arbitrary
code by uploading files with other executable extensions such as .inc,
.php4, or others.
