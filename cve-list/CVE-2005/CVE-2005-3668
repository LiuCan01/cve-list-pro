Multiple buffer overflows in multiple unspecified implementations of
Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) have multiple unspecified
attack vectors and impacts related to denial of service, as
demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due to
the lack of information in the original sources, it is likely that
this candidate will be REJECTed once it is known which implementations
are actually vulnerable.
