Reference: IDEFENSE:20050913 Linksys WRT54G Router Remote Administration Fixed Encryption Key Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=304&type=vulnerabilities

ezconfig.asp in Linksys WRT54G router 3.01.03, 3.03.6, non-default
configurations of 2.04.4, and possibly other versions, does not use an
authentication initialization function, which allows remote attackers
to obtain encrypted configuration information and, if the key is
known, modify the configuration.
