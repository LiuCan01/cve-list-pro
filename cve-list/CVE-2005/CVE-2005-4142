The web interface for subscribing new users in Lyris ListManager 5.0
through 8.8b, in combination with a line wrap feature, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary list administration commands via LFCR
(%0A%0D) sequences in the pw parameter.  NOTE: it is not clear whether
this is a variant of a CRLF injection vulnerability.
