Sudo before 1.6.8 p12, when the Perl taint flag is off, does not clear
the (1) PERLLIB, (2) PERL5LIB, and (3) PERL5OPT environment variables,
which allows limited local users to cause a Perl script to include and
execute arbitrary library files that have the same name as library
files that are included by the script.
