CitrusDB 0.3.6 and earlier generates easily predictable MD5 hashes of
the user name for the id_hash cookie, which allows remote attackers to
bypass authentication and gain privileges by calculating the MD5
checksum of the user name combined with the "boogaadeeboo" string,
which is hard-coded in the $hidden_hash variable.
