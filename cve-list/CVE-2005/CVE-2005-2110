WordPress 1.5.1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via (1) a direct request to menu-header.php or a
"1" value in the feed parameter to (2) wp-atom.php, (3) wp-rss.php, or
(4) wp-rss2.php, which reveal the path in an error message.  NOTE:
vector [1] was later reported to also affect WordPress 2.0.1.
