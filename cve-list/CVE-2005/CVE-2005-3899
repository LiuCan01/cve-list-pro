The automatic update feature in Google Talk allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) by poisoning a
target's DNS cache and causing a large update file to be sent, which
consumes large amounts of CPU and memory during the signature
verification, aka BenjiBug.
