Reference: BUGTRAQ:20051216 phpCOIN-1.2.2-Full-2005 SQL Injection
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/419637/100/0/threaded

SQL injection vulnerability in articlesarticles_funcs.php in phpCOIN
1.2.2 allows remote attackers to modify SQL syntax and possibly
execute SQL in limited circumstances via the rec_next parameter.
NOTE: the original disclosure suggests that command injection is not
feasible because the injection occurs after an "ORDER BY" clause, but
it is likely that this bug could result in an error message path
disclosure due to a syntax error, in some environments.  Therefore
this is an exposure and should be included in CVE.
