scponlyc in scponly 4.1 and earlier, when the operating system
supports LD_PRELOAD mechanisms, allows local users to execute
arbitrary code with root privileges by creating a chroot directory in
their home directory, hard linking to a system setuid application, and
using a modified LD_PRELOAD to modify expected function calls in the
setuid application.
