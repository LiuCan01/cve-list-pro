Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Autonomy (formerly Verity)
KeyView SDK before 9.2.0, as used in Lotus Notes 6.5.4 and 7.0, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a UUE file
containing an encoded file with a long filename handled by uudrdr.dll,
(2) a compressed ZIP file with a long filename handled by kvarcve.dll,
(3) a TAR archive with a long filename that is extracted to a
directory with a long path handled by the TAR reader (tarrdr.dll), (4)
an email that contains a long HTTP, FTP, or // link handled by the
HTML speed reader (htmsr.dll) or (5) an email containing a crafted
long link handled by the HTML speed reader (htmsr.dll).
