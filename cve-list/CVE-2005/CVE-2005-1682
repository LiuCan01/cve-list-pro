** DISPUTED **

JavaMail API, as used by Solstice Internet Mail Server POP3 2.0, does
not properly validate the message number in the MimeMessage
constructor in javax.mail.internet.InternetHeaders, which allows
remote authenticated users to read other users' e-mail messages by
modifying the msgno parameter.  NOTE: Sun disputes this issue, stating
"The report makes references to source code and files that do not
exist in the mentioned products."
