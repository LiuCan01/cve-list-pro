CRLF injection vulnerability in FlatNuke 2.5.5 and possibly earlier
versions allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP commands via
an ASCII char 13 (carriage return) in the signature field, which is
injected into a PHP script without a preceding comment character,
which can then be executed by a direct request.
