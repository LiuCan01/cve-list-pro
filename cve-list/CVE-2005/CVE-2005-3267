Integer overflow in Skype client before 1.4.x.84 on Windows, before
1.3.x.17 on Mac OS, before 1.2.x.18 on Linux, and 1.1.x.6 and earlier
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
crafted network data with a large Object Counter value, which leads to
a resultant heap-based buffer overflow.
