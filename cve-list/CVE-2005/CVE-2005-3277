The LPD service in HP-UX 10.20 11.11 (11i) and earlier allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters ("`" or
single backquote) in a request that is not properly handled when an
error occurs, as demonstrated by killing the connection, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2002-1473.
