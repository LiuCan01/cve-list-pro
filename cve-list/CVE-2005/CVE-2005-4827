Internet Explorer 6.0, and possibly other versions, allows remote
attackers to bypass the same origin security policy and make requests
outside of the intended domain by calling open on an XMLHttpRequest
object (Microsoft.XMLHTTP) and using tab, newline, and carriage return
characters within the first argument (method name), which is supported
by some proxy servers that convert tabs to spaces.  NOTE: this issue
can be leveraged to conduct referer spoofing, HTTP Request Smuggling,
and other attacks.
