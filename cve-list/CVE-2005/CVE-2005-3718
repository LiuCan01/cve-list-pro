UTStarcom F1000 VOIP WIFI Phone s2.0 running VxWorks 5.5.1 with kernel
WIND 2.6 does not allow users to disable access to (1) SNMP or (2) the
rlogin port TCP 513, which allows remote attackers to exploit other
vulnerabilities such as CVE-2005-3716, or execute arbitrary shell
commands via rlogin, which does not require authentication.
