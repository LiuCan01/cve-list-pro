The AppleScript Editor in Mac OS X 10.3.9 does not properly display
script code for an applescript: URI, which can result in code that is
different than the actual code that would be run, which could allow
remote attackers to trick users into executing malicious code via
certain URI characters such as NULL, control characters, and
homographs.
