The 802.1q VLAN protocol allows remote attackers to bypass network
segmentation and spoof VLAN traffic via a message with two 802.1q
tags, which causes the second tag to be redirected from a downstream
switch after the first tag has been stripped, as demonstrated by
Yersinia, aka "double-tagging VLAN jumping attack."
