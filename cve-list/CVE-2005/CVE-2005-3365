Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in DCP-Portal 6 and earlier
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, possibly
requiring encoded characters, via (1) the name parameter in
register.php, (2) the email parameter in lostpassword.php, (3) the
year parameter in calendar.php, and the (4) cid parameter to
index.php.  NOTE: the mid parameter for forums.php is already
associated with CVE-2005-0454.  NOTE: the index.php/cid vector was
later reported to affect 6.11.
