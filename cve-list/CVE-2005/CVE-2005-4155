registration.PHP in ATutor 1.5.1 pl2 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary SQL commands via an e-mail address that ends in a
NULL character, which bypasses the PHP regular expression check.
NOTE: it is possible that this is actually a bug in PHP code, in which
case this should not be treated as a vulnerability in ATutor.
