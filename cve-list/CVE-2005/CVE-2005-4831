viewcvs in ViewCVS 0.9.2 allows remote attackers to set the
Content-Type header to arbitrary values via the content-type
parameter, which can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) and
other attacks, as demonstrated using (1) "text/html", or (2)
"image/jpeg" with an image that is rendered as HTML by Internet
Explorer, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1062.  NOTE: it was
later reported that 0.9.4 is also affected.
