SaveWebPortal 3.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a direct request to admin/PhpMyExplorer/editerfichier.php,
then editing the desired file to contain the PHP code, as demonstrated
using header.php in the fichier parameter.  NOTE: it is possible that
this vulnerability stems from PhpMyExplorer, which is a separate
package.
