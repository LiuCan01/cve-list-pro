Race condition in the ia32 compatibility code for the execve system
call in Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.31 and 2.6 before 2.6.6 allows
local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via a concurrent thread that increments a
pointer count after the nargs function has counted the pointers, but
before the count is copied from user space to kernel space, which
leads to a buffer overflow.
