The URL parser in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.1 on
Windows XP Professional SP2 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via multiple requests to ".dll" followed by arguments
such as "~0" through "~9", which causes ntdll.dll to produce a return
value that is not correctly handled by IIS, as demonstrated using
"/_vti_bin/.dll/*/~0".  NOTE: the consequence was originally believed
to be only a denial of service (application crash and reboot).
