** REJECT **

cart.php in LiteCommerce might allow remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via invalid (1) category_id or (2) product_id
parameters.  NOTE: this issue was originally claimed to be due to SQL
injection, but the original researcher is known to be frequently
inaccurate with respect to bug type and severity.  The vendor has
disputed this issue, saying "These reports are credited to malicious
person we refused to hire. We have not taken legal action against him
only because he is located in India.  The vulnerabilites reported can
not be reproduced, hence information you provide is contrary to fact."
Further investigation by CVE personnel shows that an invalid SQL
syntax error could be generated, but it only reveals portions of
underlying database structure, which is already available in
documentation from the vendor, and it does not appear to lead to path
disclosure.  Therefore, this issue is not a vulnerability or an
exposure, and it probably should be REJECTED.
