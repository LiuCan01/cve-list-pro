betaparticle blog (bp blog) stores the database under the web root,
which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a
direct request to (1) dbBlogMX.mdb for versions before 3.0, or (2)
Blog.mdb for versions 3.0 and later.  NOTE: it was later reported that
vector 2 also affects versions 6.0 through 9.0.
