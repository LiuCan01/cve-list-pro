Race condition in IPCop (aka IPCop Firewall) before 1.4.10 might allow
local users to overwrite system configuration files and gain
privileges by replacing a backup archive during the time window when
the archive is owned by "nobody" but not yet encrypted, then executing
ipcoprscfg to restore from this backup.
