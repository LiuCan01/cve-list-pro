Stack-based buffer overflow in JDBC Applet Server in IBM DB2 8.1
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary by connecting and sending
a long username, then disconnecting gracefully and reconnecting and
sending a short username and an unexpected db2java.zip version, which
causes a null terminator to be removed and leads to the overflow.
