** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in Quantum Art QP7.Enterprise (formerly
Q-Publishing) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the p_news_id parameter to (1) news_and_events_new.asp
and (2) news.asp.  NOTE: on 20060227, the vendor disputed the accuracy
of this report, saying that the p_news_id, news_and_events_new.asp,
and news.asp are not specifically part of their product, although they
could be dynamically generated through use of the product.  Some
investigation by CVE suggests evidence that the
news_and_events_new.asp page has at least a forced invalid SQL syntax
error, but this could not be repeated for news.asp.
