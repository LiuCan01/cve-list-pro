SHA-1 is not collision resistant, which makes it easier for
context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks, as
demonstrated by attacks on the use of SHA-1 in TLS 1.2.  NOTE: this CVE
exists to provide a common identifier for referencing this SHA-1
issue; the existence of an identifier is not, by itself, a technology
recommendation.
