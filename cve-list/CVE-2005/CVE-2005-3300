The register_globals emulation layer in grab_globals.php for
phpMyAdmin before 2.6.4-pl3 does not perform safety checks on values
in the _FILES array for uploaded files, which allows remote attackers
to include arbitrary files by using direct requests to library scripts
that do not use grab_globals.php, then modifying certain configuration
values for the theme.
