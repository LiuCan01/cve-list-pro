Reference: IDEFENSE:20050913 Linksys WRT54G 'upgrade.cgi' Firmware Upload Design Error Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=307&type=vulnerabilities

Linksys WRT54G 3.01.03, 3.03.6, 4.00.7, and possibly other versions
before 4.20.7, does not verify user authentication until after an HTTP
POST request has been processed, which allows remote attackers to (1)
modify configuration using restore.cgi or (2) upload new firmware
using upgrade.cgi.
