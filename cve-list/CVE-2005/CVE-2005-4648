Buffer overflow in Illustrate dBpowerAMP Music Converter 11.5 and
earlier, possibly including (1) MusicConverter.exe, (2) playlist.exe,
and (3) amp.exe, allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of
service or execute arbitrary code via a .m3u playlist with a long
entry, possibly involving large field names, as demonstrated by
SecuBox.Labs.m3u.  NOTE: this issue might be the same as the .m3u
vulnerability in CVE-2004-1569, but if so, then CD:SF-LOC suggests
creating a different identifier since the .m3u issue would affect
different versions than the .pls issue.
