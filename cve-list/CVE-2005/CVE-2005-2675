** DISPUTED ** Note: the vendor has disputed this issue.
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Land Down Under (LDU) 800
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) s
or (2) m parameter to forums.php, (3) o, (4) w, (5) s, or (6) p
parameter to list.php, (7) m parameter to journal.php, (8) x or (9) n
parameter to forums.php, or (10) w parameter to links.php.  NOTE: this
issue has been disputed by the vendor, who says "None of the tricks
written there are working, the variables are properly sanitized and no
LDU version is affected."
