** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Polopoly 9 and earlier
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
unspecified search parameters. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this
vulnerability, stating that the "XSS flaw was only part of the custom
implementation of the [polopoly] site".  As of 20061003, CVE has no
further information on this issue, except that the original researcher
has a history of testing live sites and assuming that discoveries
indicate vulnerabilities in the associated package.
