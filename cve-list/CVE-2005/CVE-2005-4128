DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2005-4092.  Reason:
This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2005-4092.  This candidate was
originally published to handle a pre-patch vague announcement, but
multiple simultaneous pre-patch announcements resulted in duplicate
CVEs that could not be identified until a full patch was released.
