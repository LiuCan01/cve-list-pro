Reference: BUGTRAQ:20050415 [Overflow.pl] GOCR - Multiple vulnerabilities
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=111358557823673&w=2
Reference: MISC:http://www.overflow.pl/adv/gocr.txt

Integer overflow in the readpgm function in pnm.c for GOCR 0.40, when
using the netpbm library, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a PNM file with large width and height values, which leads to
a heap-based buffer overflow.
