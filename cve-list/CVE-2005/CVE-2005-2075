PHP-Fusion 5.0 and 6.0 stores the database file with a predictable
filename under the web document root with insufficient access control,
which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a
direct request to the filename in the administration/db_backups
directory in PHP-Fusion 6.0 or the fusion_admin/db_backups directory
in 5.0.
