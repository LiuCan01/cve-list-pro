Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Yet Another PHP
Image Gallery (YaPIG) 0.95b and earlier allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the Homepage field (aka
the Website field) in an "image-related comment" and (2) the img_size
field in view.php.  NOTE: due to lack of details from the researcher,
it is not clear whether the comment vector overlaps CVE-2005-1886.
