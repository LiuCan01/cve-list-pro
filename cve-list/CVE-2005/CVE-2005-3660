Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion and panic) by creating a large number of connected
file descriptors or socketpairs and setting a large data transfer
buffer, then preventing Linux from being able to finish the transfer
by causing the process to become a zombie, or closing the file
descriptor without closing an associated reference.
