The Downloadable RADIUS ACLs feature in Cisco PIX and VPN 3000
concentrators, when creating an ACL on the Cisco Secure Access Control
Server (CS ACS), generates a random internal name for an ACL that is
also used as a hidden user name and password, which allows remote
attackers to gain privileges by sniffing the username from the
cleartext portion of a RADIUS session, then using the password to log
in to another device that uses CS ACS.
