The user interface in the Windows Firewall does not properly display
certain malformed entries in the Windows Registry, which makes it
easier for attackers with administrator privileges to hide activities
if the administrator only uses the Windows Firewall interface to
monitor exceptions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that
since administrative privileges are already required, it is not a
vulnerability.  CVE has not yet formally decided if such "information
hiding" issues should be included.
