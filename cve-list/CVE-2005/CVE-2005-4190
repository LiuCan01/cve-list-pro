Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Horde
Application Framework before 3.0.8 allow remote authenticated users to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via multiple vectors, as
demonstrated by (1) the identity field, (2) Category and (3) Label
search fields, (4) the Mobile Phone field, and (5) Date and (6) Time
fields when importing CSV files, as exploited through modules such as
(a) Turba Address Book, (b) Kronolith, (c) Mnemo, and (d) Nag.
