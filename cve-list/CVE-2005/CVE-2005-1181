** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.  PHP remote code
injection vulnerability in loader.php for Ariadne CMS 2.4 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by modifying the
ariadne parameter to reference a URL on a remote web server that
contains the code.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying
that loader.php first requires the "ariadne.inc" file, which defines
the $ariadne variable, and thus it cannot be modified by an attacker.
In addition, CVE personnel have partially verified the dispute via
source code inspection of Ariadne 2.4 as available on July 5, 2005.
