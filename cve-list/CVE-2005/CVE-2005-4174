eFiction 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, in unspecified environments, might allow
remote attackers to conduct unauthorized operations by directly
accessing (1) install.php or (2) upgrade.php.  NOTE: it is unclear
whether this is a vulnerability in eFiction itself or the result of
incorrect system administration practices, e.g. by not removing
utility scripts once they have been used.
