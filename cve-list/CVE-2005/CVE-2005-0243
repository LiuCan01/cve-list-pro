Yahoo! Messenger 6.0.0.1750, and possibly other versions before
6.0.0.1921, does not properly display long filenames in file dialog
boxes, which could allow remote attackers to trick users into
downloading and executing programs via file names containing a large
number of spaces and multiple file extensions.
