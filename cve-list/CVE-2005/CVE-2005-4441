The PVLAN protocol allows remote attackers to bypass network
segmentation and spoof PVLAN traffic via a PVLAN message with a target
MAC address that is set to a gateway router, which causes the packet
to be sent to the router, where the source MAC is modified, aka
"Modification of the MAC spoofing PVLAN jumping attack," as
demonstrated by pvlan.c.
