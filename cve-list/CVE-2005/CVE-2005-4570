The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementations in
Fortinet FortiOS 2.50, 2.80 and 3.0, FortiClient 2.0,; and
FortiManager 2.80 and 3.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (termination of a process that is automatically restarted) via
IKE packets with invalid values of certain IPSec attributes, as
demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due to
the lack of details in the vendor advisory, it is unclear which of
CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or CVE-2005-3668 this issue applies
to.
