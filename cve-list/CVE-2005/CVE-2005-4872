Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.2 does not
properly count the number of named capturing subpatterns, which allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
regular expression with a large number of named subpatterns, which
triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed
by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
