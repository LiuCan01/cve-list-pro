Cacti 0.8.6e and earlier does not perform proper input validation to
protect against common attacks, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands or SQL by sending a legitimate value in a
POST request or cookie, then specifying the attack string in the URL,
which causes the get_request_var function to return the wrong value in
the $_REQUEST variable, which is cleansed while the original malicious
$_GET value remains unmodified, as demonstrated in (1) graph_image.php
and (2) graph.php.
