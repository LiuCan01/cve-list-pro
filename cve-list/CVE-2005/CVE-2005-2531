OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with "verb 0" and without TLS
authentication, does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a
client fails certificate authentication to the server and causes the
error to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via a
large number of failed authentication attempts.
