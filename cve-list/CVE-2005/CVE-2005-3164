The AJP connector in Apache Tomcat 4.0.1 through 4.0.6 and 4.1.0
through 4.1.36, as used in Hitachi Cosminexus Application Server and
standalone, does not properly handle when a connection is broken
before request body data is sent in a POST request, which can lead to
an information leak when "unsuitable request body data" is used for a
different request, possibly related to Java Servlet pages.
