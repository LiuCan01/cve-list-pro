Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 4.5.0
through 4.5.5 and 4.6.0 through 4.6.3 allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via various HTML tags and values, such as
the (1) legend tag and the value parameter used in (2) label and (3)
input tags, possibly due to an incomplete blacklist.
