PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in CzarNews 1.13b allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the tpath parameter
to (1) headlines.php or (2) news.php.  NOTE: some sources have
reported the "dir" parameter as being affected; however, this is
likely a cut-and-paste error from the wrong section of the original
vulnerability report.  Also, the news.php version was later reported
to be in 1.12 through 1.14.
