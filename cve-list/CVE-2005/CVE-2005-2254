Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in PhpAuction 2.5
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
lan parameter to (1) index.php or (2) admin/index.php, or (3) the
auction_id parameter to profile.php.  NOTE: there is evidence that
viewnews.php and login.php may not be part of the PhpAuction product,
so they are not included in this description.
