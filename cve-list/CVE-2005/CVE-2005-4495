** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in index.cfm in SpireMedia mx7 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the cid
parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, stating "This
information is incorrect, unproven, and potentially slanderous."
However, CVE and OSVDB have both performed additional research that
suggests that this might be path disclosure from invalid SQL syntax.
