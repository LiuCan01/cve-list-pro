BibORB 1.3.2, and possibly earlier versions, does not properly enforce
a restriction for uploading only PDF and PS files, which allows remote
attackers to upload arbitrary files that are presented to other users
with PDF or PS icons, which may trick some users into downloading and
executing those files.
