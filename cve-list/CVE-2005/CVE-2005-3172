The WideCharToMultiByte function in Microsoft Windows 2000 before
Update Rollup 1 for SP4 does not properly convert strings with
Japanese composite characters in the last character, which could
prevent the string from being null terminated and lead to data
corruption or enable buffer overflow attacks.
