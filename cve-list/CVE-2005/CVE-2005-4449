verify.php in FlatNuke 2.5.6 allows remote authenticated
administrators to modify arbitrary PHP files by setting the file
parameter to an arbitrary file and injecting the code into the body
parameter.  NOTE: if a FlatNuke administrator is normally assumed to
be able to modify arbitrary content, then this issue does not cross
privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.
