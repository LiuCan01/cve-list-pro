Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and earlier on Linux allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (client crash) via an IFRAME element with a
large value of the WIDTH attribute, which triggers a problem related
to representation of floating-point numbers, leading to an infinite
loop of widget resizes and a corresponding large number of function
calls on the stack.
