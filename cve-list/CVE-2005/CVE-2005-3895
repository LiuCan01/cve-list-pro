Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) 1.0.0 through 1.3.2 and 2.0.0
through 2.0.3, when AttachmentDownloadType is set to inline, renders
text/html e-mail attachments as HTML in the browser when the queue
moderator attempts to download the attachment, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML.  NOTE: this
particular issue is referred to as XSS by some sources.
