** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in OvBB 0.08a allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) threadid
parameter to thread.php and (2) userid parameter to profile.php.
NOTE: the vendor disputes these issues, saying "these reports are
completely unsubstantial."
