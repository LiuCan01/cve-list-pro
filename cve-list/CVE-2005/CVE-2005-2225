Microsoft MSN Messenger allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service via a plaintext message containing the ".pif" string, which is
interpreted as a malicious file extension and causes users to be
kicked from a group conversation.  NOTE: it has been reported that
Gaim is also affected, so this may be an issue in the protocol or MSN
servers.
