Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ProductCart 2.7 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the Category or
resultCnt parameters to advSearch_h.asp, and possibly (2) the offset
parameter to tarinasworld_butterflyjournal.asp.  NOTE: it is possible
that item (2) is the result of a typo or editing error from the
original research report.
