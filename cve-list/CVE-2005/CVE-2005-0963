An error in the Toshiba ACPI BIOS 1.6 causes the BIOS to only examine
the first slot in the Master Boot Record (MBR) table for an active
partition, which prevents the system from booting even though the MBR
is not malformed.  NOTE: it has been debated as to whether or not this
issue poses a security vulnerability, since administrative privileges
would be required, and other DoS attacks are possible with such
privileges.
