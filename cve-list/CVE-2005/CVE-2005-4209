WorldClient webmail in Alt-N MDaemon 8.1.3 allows remote attackers to
prevent arbitrary users from accessing their inboxes via script tags
in the Subject header of an e-mail message, which prevents the user
from being able to access the Inbox folder, possibly due to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
