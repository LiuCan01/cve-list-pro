index.php in ezDatabase 2.1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via an invalid cat_id parameter, which
leaks the full pathname in an error message.  NOTE: these details are
uncertain because the original report has terminology problems and
lack of relevant details.  The description is based partially on
feedback comments.
