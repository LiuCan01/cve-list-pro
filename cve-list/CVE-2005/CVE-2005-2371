Directory traversal vulnerability in Oracle Reports 6.0, 6i, 9i, and
10g allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via (1) "..",
(2) Windows drive letter (C:), and (3) absolute path sequences in the
desname parameter.  NOTE: this issue was probably fixed by REP06 in
CPU Jan 2006, in which case it overlaps CVE-2006-0289.
