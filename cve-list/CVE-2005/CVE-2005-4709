The popSubjectContext method in the SecurityAssociation class in JBoss
Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 3.0 RC3 maintains the threadPrincipal and
threadCredential values from a previous client's authentication after
termination of a client session, which allows remote attackers to gain
the roles of an arbitrary previous client who had the same JBoss
server thread.
