The NPSVG3.dll ActiveX control for Adobe SVG Viewer 3.02 and earlier,
when running on Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to
determine the existence of arbitrary files by setting the src property
to the target filename and using Javascript to determine if the web
page immediately stops loading, which indicates whether the file
exists or not.
