** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the login command in
calendar.pl in CalendarScript 3.21 allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2005-1145.
