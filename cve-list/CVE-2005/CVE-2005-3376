Multiple interpretation error in Kaspersky 5.0.372 allows remote
attackers to bypass virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML, and
EML with an "MZ" magic byte sequence which is normally associated with
EXE, which causes the file to be treated as a safe type that could
still be executed as a dangerous file type by applications on the end
system, as demonstrated by a "triple headed" program that contains
EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the "magic byte bug."
