Heap-based buffer overflow in bogofilter 0.96.2, 0.95.2, 0.94.14,
0.94.12, and other versions from 0.93.5 to 0.96.2, when using Unicode
databases, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via "invalid input
sequences" that lead to heap corruption when bogofilter or bogolexer
converts character sets.
