Kolab Server 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 does not properly handle when a large
email is sent with a "." in the wrong place, which causes kolabfilter
to add another ".", which might break clear-text signatures and
attachments.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses
privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability.
