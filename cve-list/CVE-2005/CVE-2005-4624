The m_join function in channel.c for PTnet ircd 1.5 and 1.6 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion that
triggers a daemon restart) via a large number of requests to join a
"charmed channel" such as PTnet, #PTnoticias and #*.log, which causes
ircd to open the channel even though it does not have any valid users.
