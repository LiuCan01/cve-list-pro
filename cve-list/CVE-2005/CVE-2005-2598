Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Dokeos 1.6 and
earlier, and possibly Claroline, allow remote attackers to (1) delete
arbitrary files or directories via the delete parameter to
claroline/scorm/scormdocument.php, (2) move arbitrary files via the
move_to and move_file parameters to claroline/document/document.php,
or determine the existence of arbitrary files via the file parameter
to (3) claroline/scorm/showinframes.php or (4)
claroline/scorm/contents.php.
