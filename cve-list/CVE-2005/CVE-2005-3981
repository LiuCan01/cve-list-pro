** DISPUTED **

NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties.  Microsoft
Windows XP, 2000, and 2003 allows local users to kill a writable
process by using the CreateRemoteThread function with certain
arguments on a process that has been opened using the OpenProcess
function, possibly involving an invalid address for the start routine.
NOTE: followup posts have disputed this issue, saying that if a user
already has privileges to write to a process, then other functions
could be called or the process could be terminated using
PROCESS_TERMINATE.
