Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cisco IOS Web Server for
IOS 12.0(2a) allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML by (1) packets containing HTML that an administrator views via an
HTTP interface to the contents of memory buffers, as demonstrated by
the URI /level/15/exec/-/buffers/assigned/dump; or (2) sending the
router Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets with HTML payload that
an administrator views via the CDP status pages.  NOTE: these vectors
were originally reported as being associated with the dump and packet
options in /level/15/exec/-/show/buffers.
