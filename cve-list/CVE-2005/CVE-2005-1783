BookReview beta 1.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the path of the
web server via certain parameters to search.htm, possibly due to a
search[string] parameter with a missing value or an incorrect
submit[type] value, which reveals the path in the resulting error
message.  NOTE: it is not clear whether BookReview is available to the
public.  If not, then it should not be included in CVE.
