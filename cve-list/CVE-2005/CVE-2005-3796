Direct static code injection vulnerability in admin_options_manage.php
in AlstraSoft Affiliate Network Pro 7.2 allows attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via the number parameter.  NOTE: it is not clear
from the original report whether administrator privileges are
required.  If not, then this does not cross privilege boundaries and
is not a vulnerability.
