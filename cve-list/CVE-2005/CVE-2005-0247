Multiple buffer overflows in gram.y for PostgreSQL 8.0.1 and earlier
may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a large number
of variables in a SQL statement being handled by the
read_sql_construct function, (2) a large number of INTO variables in a
SELECT statement being handled by the make_select_stmt function, (3) a
large number of arbitrary variables in a SELECT statement being
handled by the make_select_stmt function, and (4) a large number of
INTO variables in a FETCH statement being handled by the
make_fetch_stmt function, a different set of vulnerabilities than
CVE-2005-0245.
