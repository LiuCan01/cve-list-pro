Zyxel P310, P314, P324 and Netgear RT311, RT314 running the latest
firmware, allows remote attackers on the WAN to obtain the IP address
of the LAN side interface by pinging a valid LAN IP address, which
generates an ARP reply from the WAN address side that maps the LAN IP
address to the WAN's MAC address.
