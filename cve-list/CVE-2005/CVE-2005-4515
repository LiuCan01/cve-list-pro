** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in WebDB 1.1 and earlier allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified search
parameters, possibly Search0.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this
issue, saying that "WebDB is a generic online database system used by
many of the clients of Lois Software. The flaw that was identified was
some code that was added for a client to do some testing of his system
and only certain safe commands were allowed. This code has now been
removed and it is not now possible to use SQL queries as part of the
query string.  No installation or patch is required All clients use a
common code library and have their own front end and databases and
connections. So as soon as a change / upgrade / enhancement is made to
the code, all users of the software begin to use the latest changes
immediately."  Since the issue appeared in a custom web site and no
action is required on the part of customers, this issue should not be
included in CVE.
