PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in mail_autocheck.php in the
Email This Entry add-on for pMachine Pro 2.4, and possibly other
versions including pMachine Free, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code by directly requesting mail_autocheck.php and
modifying the pm_path parameter to reference a URL on a remote web
server that contains the code, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2003-1086.
