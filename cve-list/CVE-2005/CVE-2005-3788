Race condition in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 7.0(0),
7.0(2), and 7.0(4), when running with an Active/Standby configuration
and when the failover LAN interface fails, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (standby firewall failure) by sending
spoofed ARP responses from an IP address of an active firewall, which
prevents the standby firewall from becoming active, aka "failover
denial of service."
