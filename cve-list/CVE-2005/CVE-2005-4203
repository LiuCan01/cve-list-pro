LogiSphere 0.9.9j does not restrict the number of messages that can be
sent, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by
sending a large number of messages via the msg command.  NOTE: due to
lack of appropriate details by the original researcher, it is unclear
whether this description accurately reflects the discloser's claim and
is distinct from the XSS issue.
