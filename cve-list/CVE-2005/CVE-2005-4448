FlatNuke 2.5.6 verifies authentication credentials based on an MD5
checksum of the admin name and the hashed password rather than the
plaintext password, which allows attackers to gain privileges by
obtaining the password hash (possibly via CVE-2005-2813), then
calculating the credentials and including them in the secid cookie.
