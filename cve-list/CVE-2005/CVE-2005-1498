Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/20436

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in myBloggie 2.1.1
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
(1) year parameter in viewmode.php, or the (2) cat_id, (3) month_no,
or (4) post_id parameter in index.php, which are not properly
sanitized before they are displayed in an error message.  NOTE: issues
2, 3, and 4 may be due to a problem in associated products rather than
myBloggie itself.
