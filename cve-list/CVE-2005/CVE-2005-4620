Buffer overflow in WinRAR 3.50 and earlier allows local users to
execute arbitrary code via a long command-line argument.  NOTE:
because this program executes with the privileges of the invoking
user, and because remote programs do not normally have the ability to
specify a command-line argument for this program, there may not be a
typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries.
Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
