Interpretation conflict in phpBB 2.0.17, with remote avatars and
avatar uploading enabled, allows remote authenticated users to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via an HTML file with a GIF or JPEG file
extension, which causes the HTML to be executed by a victim who views
the file in Internet Explorer, which renders malformed image types as
HTML, enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  NOTE: it could be
argued that this vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Internet
Explorer (CVE-2005-3312) and the proper fix should be in that browser;
if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpBB.
