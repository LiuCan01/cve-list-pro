The search_binary_handler function in exec.c in Linux 2.4 kernel on
64-bit x86 architectures does not check a return code for a particular
function call when virtual memory is low, which allows local users to
cause a denial of service (panic), as demonstrated by running a
process using the bash ulimit -v command.
