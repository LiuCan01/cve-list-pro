Electric Sheep 2.6.3 does not require authentication or integrity
checks from the server to the client, which allows remote attackers to
download and display arbitrary MPEG movie files via (1) DNS spoofing,
(2) a URL on the command line, or (3) a URL in the configuration file.
NOTE: the same attack vectors apply to common web browsers that are
able to communicate with untrusted web servers, and other problems
related to DNS design issues.  Therefore this may not be a specific
vulnerability.  However, a client would reasonably expect to receive
content only from the server.
