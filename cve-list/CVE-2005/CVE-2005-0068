Name: CVE-2005-0068
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0068
Phase: Assigned (20050113)
Category: SF
Reference: MISC:http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html
Reference: BID:13124
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/13124

The original design of ICMP does not require authentication for
host-generated ICMP error messages, which makes it easier for
attackers to forge ICMP error messages for specific TCP connections
and cause a denial of service, as demonstrated using (1) blind
connection-reset attacks with forged "Destination Unreachable"
messages, (2) blind throughput-reduction attacks with forged "Source
Quench" messages, or (3) blind throughput-reduction attacks with
forged ICMP messages that cause the Path MTU to be reduced.  NOTE:
CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based
on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and
CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the
underlying vulnerability.  While CVE normally SPLITs based on
vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety
and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the
attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.
