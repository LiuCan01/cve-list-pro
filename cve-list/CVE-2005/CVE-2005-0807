Multiple buffer overflows in Cain & Abel before 2.67 allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) an IKE packet with a large ID
field that is not properly handled by the PSK sniffer filter, (2) the
HTTP sniffer filter, or the (3) POP3, (4) SMTP, (5) IMAP, (6) NNTP, or
(7) TDS sniffer filters.
