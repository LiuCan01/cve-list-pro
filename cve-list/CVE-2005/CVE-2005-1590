The Altiris Client Service for Windows (ACLIENT.EXE) 6.0.88 allows
local users to disable password protection and access the
administrative interface by finding and showing the "Altiris Client
Service" hidden window, disabling the password protection, disabling
the "Hide client tray icon box" option, then opening the AClient tray
icon and using the View Log File option, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2004-2070.
