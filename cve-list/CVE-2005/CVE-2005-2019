ipfw in FreeBSD 5.4, when running on Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP)
or Uni Processor (UP) systems with the PREEMPTION kernel option
enabled, does not sufficiently lock certain resources while performing
table lookups, which can cause the cache results to be corrupted
during multiple concurrent lookups, allowing remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions.
