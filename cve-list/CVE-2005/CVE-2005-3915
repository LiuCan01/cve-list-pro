The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in
Clavister Client Web allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted IKE packets,
as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due
to the lack of details in the advisory, it is unclear which of
CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or CVE-2005-3668 this issue applies
to.
