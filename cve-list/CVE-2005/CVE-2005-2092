BEA Systems WebLogic 8.1 SP1 allows remote attackers to poison the web
cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS
attacks via an HTTP request with both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
header and a Content-Length header, which causes WebLogic to
incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in a way that
causes the receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP request,
aka "HTTP Request Smuggling."
