Multiple buffer overflows in Orenosv HTTP/FTP Server 0.8.1 allow
remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via long arguments to FTP commands
such as MKD, RMD, or DELE, which are processed by the (1)
ftp_xlate_path, (2) ftp_is_canonical, or (3) os_fn_nativize functions,
or (4) a long SSI command that is processed by the parse_cmd function
in cgissi.exe.
