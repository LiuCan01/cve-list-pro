IceWarp Web Mail 5.5.1, as used by Merak Mail Server 8.3.0r and
VisNetic Mail Server version 8.3.0 build 1, does not properly restrict
acceptable values for the language parameter to mail/settings.html
before it is stored in a database, which can allow remote
authenticated users to include arbitrary PHP code via a URL in a
modified lang_settings parameter to mail/index.html.
