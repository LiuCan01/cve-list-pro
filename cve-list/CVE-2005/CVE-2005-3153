login.php in myBloggie 2.1.3 beta and earlier allows remote attackers
to bypass a whitelist regular expression and conduct SQL injection
attacks via a username parameter with SQL after a null character,
which causes the whitelist check to succeed but injects the SQL into a
query string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2838.  NOTE: it
is possible that this is actually a bug in PHP code, in which case
this should not be treated as a myBloggie vulnerability.
