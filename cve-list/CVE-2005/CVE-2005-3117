** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2005-3150.  Reason:
This candidate was privately assigned by a CNA to an issue, but the
issue was published through separate channels and assigned a new
identifier by the MITRE CNA, so it is a duplicate of CVE-2005-3150.
Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2005-3150 instead of this
candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have
been removed to prevent accidental usage.
