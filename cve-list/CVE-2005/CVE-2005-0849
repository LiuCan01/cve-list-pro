Multiple games developed by FUN labs, including 4X4 Off-road Adventure
III, Big Game Hunter, Dangerous Hunts, Deer Hunt, Revolution, Secret

cause a denial of service (crash from invalid memory access) via a
malformed join packet with values that cause the server to copy more
memory than was actually provided in the packet.
