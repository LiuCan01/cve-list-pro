Buffer overflow in Electric Sheep 2.6.3 client allows local users to
execute arbitrary code via a long window-id parameter. NOTE: because
the program is not setuid and not normally called from remote
programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that
crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a
vulnerability.
