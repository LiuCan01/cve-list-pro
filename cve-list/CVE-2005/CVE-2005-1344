Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 2.0.52 may allow attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a long realm argument.  NOTE: since
htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid,
there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of
privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program.  Therefore
this may not be a vulnerability.
