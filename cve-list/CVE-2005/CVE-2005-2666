SSH, as implemented in OpenSSH before 4.0 and possibly other
implementations, stores hostnames, IP addresses, and keys in plaintext
in the known_hosts file, which makes it easier for an attacker that
has compromised an SSH user's account to generate a list of additional
targets that are more likely to have the same password or key.
