BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 8.1 SP4 and earlier and 7.0
SP6 and earlier, when using the weblogic.Deployer command with the t3
protocol, does not use the secure t3s protocol even when an
Administration port is enabled on the Administration server, which
might allow remote attackers to sniff the connection.
