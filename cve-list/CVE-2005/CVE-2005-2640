Behavioral discrepancy information leak in Juniper Netscreen VPN
running ScreenOS 5.2.0 and earlier, when using IKE with pre-shared key
authentication, allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames
via an IKE Aggressive Mode packet, which generates a response if the
username is valid but does not respond when the username is invalid.
