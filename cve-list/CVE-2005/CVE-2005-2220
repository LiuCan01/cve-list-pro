** DISPUTED **

Dragonfly Commerce allows remote attackers to change a product price
by modifying the x_DragonflyCartProductPrice hidden field to (1)
dc_Categorieslist.asp, (2) dc_Categoriesview.asp, (3)
dc_productslist.asp, and (4) dc_productslist_Clearance.asp.  NOTE: the
vendor has disputed this issue, saying that "Dragonfly Commerce does
not allow for editing prices nor does it allow for viewing information
about clients stored in the database except by the store owner and
authorized staff as appointed in the store administration."  However,
SecurityTracker claims that they have been able to confirm the
problem.
