MD5 Neighbor Authentication in Extended Interior Gateway Routing
Protocol (EIGRP) 1.2, as implemented in Cisco IOS 11.3 and later, does
not include the Message Authentication Code (MAC) in the checksum,
which allows remote attackers to sniff message hashes and (1) replay
EIGRP HELLO messages or (2) cause a denial of service by sending a
large number of spoofed EIGRP neighbor announcements, which results in
an ARP storm on the local network.
