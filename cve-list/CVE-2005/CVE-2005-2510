The Server Admin tool in servermgr_ipfilter for Mac OS X 10.4 to
10.4.2, when using multiple subnets and Address Groups, does not
always properly write firewall rules to the Active Rules when certain
conditions occur, which could result in firewall policies that are
less restrictive than intended by the administrator.
