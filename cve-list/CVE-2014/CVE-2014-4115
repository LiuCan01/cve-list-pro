fastfat.sys (aka the FASTFAT driver) in the kernel-mode drivers in
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Vista SP2, and Server 2008 SP2 does
not properly allocate memory, which allows physically proximate
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(reserved-memory write) by connecting a crafted USB device, aka
"Microsoft Windows Disk Partition Driver Elevation of Privilege
Vulnerability."
