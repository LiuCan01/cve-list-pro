The ThemePunch Slider Revolution (revslider) plugin before 3.0.96 for
WordPress and Showbiz Pro plugin 1.7.1 and earlier for Wordpress does
not properly restrict access to administrator AJAX functionality,
which allows remote attackers to (1) upload and execute arbitrary
files via an update_plugin action; (2) delete arbitrary sliders via a
delete_slider action; and (3) create, (4) update, (5) import, or (6)
export arbitrary sliders via unspecified vectors.
