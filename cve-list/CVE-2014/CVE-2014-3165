Use-after-free vulnerability in
modules/websockets/WorkerThreadableWebSocketChannel.cpp in the Web

36.0.1985.143, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an
unexpectedly long lifetime of a temporary object during method
completion.
