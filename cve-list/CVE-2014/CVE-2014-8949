The iMember360 plugin 3.8.012 through 3.9.001 for WordPress allows
remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary commands via
shell metacharacters in the i4w_trace parameter.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged with CVE-2014-8948 to allow remote attackers to execute
code.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue itself crosses
privileges.
