The iCloud subsystem in Apple iOS before 7.1 allows physically
proximate attackers to bypass an intended password requirement, and
turn off the Find My iPhone service or complete a Delete Account
action and then associate this service with a different Apple ID
account, by entering an arbitrary iCloud Account Password value and a
blank iCloud Account Description value.
