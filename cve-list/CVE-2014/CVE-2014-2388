The Storage and Access service in BlackBerry OS 10.x before
10.2.1.1925 on Q5, Q10, Z10, and Z30 devices does not enforce the
password requirement for SMB filesystem access, which allows
context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary files via (1) a session
over a Wi-Fi network or (2) a session over a USB connection in
Development Mode.
