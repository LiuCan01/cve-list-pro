Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101, does not
properly track JavaScript heap-memory allocations as allocations of
uninitialized memory and does not properly concatenate arrays of
double-precision floating-point numbers, which allows remote attackers
to obtain sensitive information via crafted JavaScript code, related
to the PagedSpace::AllocateRaw and NewSpace::AllocateRaw functions in
heap/spaces-inl.h, the LargeObjectSpace::AllocateRaw function in
heap/spaces.cc, and the Runtime_ArrayConcat function in runtime.cc.
