mod/lti/launch.php in the LTI module in Moodle through 2.4.11, 2.5.x
before 2.5.9, 2.6.x before 2.6.6, and 2.7.x before 2.7.3 performs
access control at the course level rather than at the activity level,
which allows remote authenticated users to bypass the mod/lti:view
capability requirement by viewing an activity instance.
