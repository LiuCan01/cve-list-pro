Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Command
School Student Management System 1.06.01 allow remote attackers to
hijack the authentication of (1) administrators for requests that
change the administrator password via an update action to
sw/admin_change_password.php or (2) unspecified victims for requests
that add a topic or blog entry to sw/add_topic.php.  NOTE: vector 2 can
be leveraged to bypass the authentication requirements for exploiting
vector 1 in CVE-2014-1914.
