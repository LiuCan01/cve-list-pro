The GenericConsumer class in the Consumer component in ZendOpenId
before 2.0.2 and the Zend_OpenId_Consumer class in Zend Framework 1
before 1.12.4 does not verify that the openid_op_endpoint value
identifies the same Identity Provider as the provider used in the
association handle, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication and spoof arbitrary OpenID identities by using a
malicious OpenID Provider that generates OpenID tokens with arbitrary
identifier and claimed_id values.
