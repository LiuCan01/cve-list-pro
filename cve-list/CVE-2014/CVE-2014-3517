api/metadata/handler.py in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.2.4,
2014.x before 2014.1.2, and Juno before Juno-2, when proxying metadata
requests through Neutron, makes it easier for remote attackers to
guess instance ID signatures via a brute-force attack that relies on
timing differences in responses to instance metadata requests.
