OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) 2014.2 through
2014.2.2 does not properly remove images, which allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by
creating a large number of images using the task v2 API and then
deleting them before the uploads finish, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2015-1881.
