AndroidManifest.xml in Android before 5.0.0 does not require the
SEND_SMS permission for the SmsReceiver receiver, which allows
attackers to send stored SMS messages, and consequently transmit
arbitrary new draft SMS messages or trigger additional per-message
charges from a network operator for old messages, via a crafted
application that broadcasts an intent with the
com.android.mms.transaction.MESSAGE_SENT action, aka Bug 17671795.
