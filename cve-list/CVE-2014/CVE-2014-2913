** DISPUTED ** Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in nrpe.c in Nagios
Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) 2.15 and earlier allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary commands via a newline character in the -a option
to libexec/check_nrpe.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by multiple
parties. It has been reported that the vendor allows newlines as
"expected behavior." Also, this issue can only occur when the
administrator enables the "dont_blame_nrpe" option in nrpe.conf
despite the "HIGH security risk" warning within the comments.
