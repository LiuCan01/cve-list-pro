WiFiMonitor in Android 4.4.4 as used in the Nexus 5 and 4, Android
4.2.2 as used in the LG D806, Android 4.2.2 as used in the Samsung
SM-T310, Android 4.1.2 as used in the Motorola RAZR HD, and
potentially other unspecified Android releases before 5.0.1 and 5.0.2
does not properly handle exceptions, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (reboot) via a crafted 802.11 probe response
frame.
