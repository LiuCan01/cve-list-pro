libnetcore in Apple iOS before 8.1.3, Apple OS X before 10.10.2, and
Apple TV before 7.0.3 does not verify that certain values have the
expected data type, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
in an _networkd context via a crafted XPC message from a sandboxed
app, as demonstrated by lack of verification of the XPC dictionary
data type.
