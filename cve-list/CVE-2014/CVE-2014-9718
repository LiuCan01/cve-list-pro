The (1) BMDMA and (2) AHCI HBA interfaces in the IDE functionality in
QEMU 1.0 through 2.1.3 have multiple interpretations of a function's
return value, which allows guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of
service (memory consumption or infinite loop, and system crash) via a
PRDT with zero complete sectors, related to the bmdma_prepare_buf and
ahci_dma_prepare_buf functions.
