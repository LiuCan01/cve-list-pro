The tm_adopt function in lib/Libifl/tm.c in Terascale Open-Source
Resource and Queue Manager (aka TORQUE Resource Manager) 5.0.x, 4.5.x,
4.2.x, and earlier does not validate that the owner of the process
also owns the adopted session id, which allows remote authenticated
users to kill arbitrary processes via a crafted executable.
