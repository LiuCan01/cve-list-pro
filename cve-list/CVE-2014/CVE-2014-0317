The Security Account Manager Remote (SAMR) protocol implementation in
Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows
Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012
Gold and R2 does not properly determine the user-lockout state, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass the account lockout
policy and obtain access via a brute-force attack, aka "SAMR Security
Feature Bypass Vulnerability."
