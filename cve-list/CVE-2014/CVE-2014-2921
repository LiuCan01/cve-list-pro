The getObjectByToken function in Newsletter.php in the
Pimcore_Tool_Newsletter module in pimcore 1.4.9 through 2.0.0 does not
properly handle an object obtained by unserializing Lucene search
data, which allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection
attacks and execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a
Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy object and a pathname with a trailing 0
character.
