The SSLSocket implementation in the (1) JSAFE and (2) JSSE APIs in EMC
RSA BSAFE SSL-J 5.x before 5.1.3 and 6.x before 6.0.2 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by
triggering application-data processing during the TLS handshake, a
time at which the data is internally buffered.
