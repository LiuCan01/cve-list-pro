The rftpcom.dll ActiveX control in Attachmate Reflection FTP Client
before 14.1.429 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) and execute arbitrary code via vectors related to
the (1) GetGlobalSettings or (2) GetSiteProperties3 methods, which
triggers a dereference of an arbitrary memory address.  NOTE: this
issue was MERGED with CVE-2014-0606 because it is the same type of
vulnerability, affecting the same set of versions, and discovered by
the same researcher.
