Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 through 11 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by Sebastian Apelt
and Andreas Schmidt during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2014.
NOTE: the original disclosure referred to triggering a kernel bug with
the Internet Explorer exploit payload, but this ID is not for a kernel
vulnerability.
