The auth_token middleware in the OpenStack Python client library for
Keystone (aka python-keystoneclient) before 0.7.0 does not properly
retrieve user tokens from memcache, which allows remote authenticated
users to gain privileges in opportunistic circumstances via a large
number of requests, related to an "interaction between eventlet and
python-memcached."
