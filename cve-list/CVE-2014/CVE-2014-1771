SChannel in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11 does not ensure
that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as
it was before renegotiation, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
to obtain sensitive information or modify TLS session data via a
"triple handshake attack," aka "TLS Server Certificate Renegotiation
Vulnerability."
