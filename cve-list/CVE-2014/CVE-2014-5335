Reference: BUGTRAQ:20140821 [CVE-2014-5335] CSRF in Innovaphone PBX
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/533197/100/0/threaded

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
innovaphone PBX 10.00 sr11 and earlier allow remote attackers to
hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that modify
configurations or user accounts, as demonstrated by (1) changing the
administrator password via a crafted request to CMD0/mod_cmd.xml or
(2) adding a new SIP user via a crafted request to
PBX0/ADMIN/mod_cmd_login.xml.
