Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/04/07/2
Reference: CONFIRM:http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=5678de3f15010b9022ee45673f33bcfc71d47b60
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1081589

The ioapic_deliver function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel
through 3.14.1 does not properly validate the kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic
return value, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service
(host OS crash) via a crafted entry in the redirection table of an I/O
APIC.  NOTE: the affected code was moved to the ioapic_service function
before the vulnerability was announced.
