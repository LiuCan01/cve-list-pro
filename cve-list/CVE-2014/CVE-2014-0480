The core.urlresolvers.reverse function in Django before 1.4.14, 1.5.x
before 1.5.9, 1.6.x before 1.6.6, and 1.7 before release candidate 3
does not properly validate URLs, which allows remote attackers to
conduct phishing attacks via a // (slash slash) in a URL, which
triggers a scheme-relative URL to be generated.
