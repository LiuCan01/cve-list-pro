content/renderer/device_sensors/device_orientation_event_pump.cc in
Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict access to
high-rate gyroscope data, which makes it easier for remote attackers
to obtain speech signals from a device's physical environment via a
crafted web site that listens for ondeviceorientation events, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1231.
