The MCollective aes_security plugin, as used in Puppet Enterprise
before 3.3.0 and Mcollective before 2.5.3, does not properly validate
new server certificates based on the CA certificate, which allows
local users to establish unauthorized Mcollective connections via
unspecified vectors related to a race condition.
