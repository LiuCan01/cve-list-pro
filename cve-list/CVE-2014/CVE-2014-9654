The Regular Expressions package in International Components for
Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ before 2014-12-03, as used in Google Chrome
before 40.0.2214.91, calculates certain values without ensuring that
they can be represented in a 24-bit field, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, a related issue to
CVE-2014-7923.
