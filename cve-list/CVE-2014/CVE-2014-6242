Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the All In One WP Security &
Firewall plugin before 3.8.3 for WordPress allow remote authenticated
users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) orderby or (2)
order parameter in the aiowpsec page to wp-admin/admin.php.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands.
