dpkg 1.15.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect
the patch program to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded
filenames" feature, but is supported in environments with noncompliant
patch programs, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote
attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files
outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic
constraints on the behavior of an external program.
