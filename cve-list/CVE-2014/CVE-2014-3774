Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in items.php in
TeamPass before 2.1.20 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the group parameter, which is not properly handled
in a (1) hid_cat or (2) open_folder form element, or (3) id parameter,
which is not properly handled in the open_id form element.
