Reference: BUGTRAQ:20140408 Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2014-04-08
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/531762

The password recovery service in Open-Xchange AppSuite before
7.2.2-rev20, 7.4.1 before 7.4.1-rev11, and 7.4.2 before 7.4.2-rev13
makes an improper decision about the sensitivity of a string
representing a previously used but currently invalid password, which
allows remote attackers to obtain potentially useful password-pattern
information by reading (1) a web-server access log, (2) a web-server
Referer log, or (3) browser history that contains this string because
of its presence in a GET request.
