Integer signedness error in the vt console driver (formerly Newcons)
in FreeBSD 9.3 before p10 and 10.1 before p6 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain privileges via a
negative value in a VT_WAITACTIVE ioctl call, which triggers an array
index error and out-of-bounds kernel memory access.
