Reference: BUGTRAQ:20140403 [softScheck] Denial of Service in Microsoft Office 2007-2013
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/531722/100/0/threaded

The XML parser in Microsoft Office 2007 SP3, 2010 SP1 and SP2, and
2013, and Office for Mac 2011, does not properly detect recursion
during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption and persistent application hang)
via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity
references, as demonstrated by a crafted text/plain e-mail message to
Outlook, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
