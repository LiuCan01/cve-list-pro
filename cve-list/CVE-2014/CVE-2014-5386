Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/ab6fdeb84fb090b48606b6f7933028cfe7bf3a5e

The mcrypt_create_iv function in
hphp/runtime/ext/mcrypt/ext_mcrypt.cpp in Facebook HipHop Virtual
Machine (HHVM) before 3.3.0 does not seed the random number generator,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
protection mechanisms by leveraging the use of a single initialization
vector.
