Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Project
Issue File Review module (PIFR) module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-2.17 for
Drupal allow (1) remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via a crafted patch, which triggers a PIFR client to test the
patch and return the results to the PIFR_Server test results page or
(2) remote authenticated users with the "manage PIFR environments"
permission to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors
involving a PIFR_Server administrative page.
