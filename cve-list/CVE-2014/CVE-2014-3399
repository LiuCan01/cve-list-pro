Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2014-3399

The SSL VPN implementation in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
Software 9.2(.2.4) and earlier does not properly manage session
information during creation of a SharePoint handler, which allows
remote authenticated users to overwrite arbitrary RAMFS cache files or
inject Lua programs, and consequently cause a denial of service
(portal outage or system reload), via crafted HTTP requests, aka Bug
ID CSCup54208.
