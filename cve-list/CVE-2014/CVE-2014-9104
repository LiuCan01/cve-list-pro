Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the
XML-RPC API in the Desktop Client in OpenVPN Access Server 1.5.6 and

administrators for requests that (1) disconnecting established VPN
sessions, (2) connect to arbitrary VPN servers, or (3) create VPN
profiles and execute arbitrary commands via crafted API requests.
