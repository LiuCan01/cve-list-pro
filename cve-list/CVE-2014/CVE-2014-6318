The audit logon feature in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) in Microsoft
Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1,
Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows
RT Gold and 8.1 does not properly log unauthorized login attempts
supplying valid credentials, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a series of
attempts, aka "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Failure to Audit
Vulnerability."
