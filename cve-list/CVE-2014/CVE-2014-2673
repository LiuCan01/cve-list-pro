The arch_dup_task_struct function in the Transactional Memory (TM)
implementation in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c in the Linux kernel
before 3.13.7 on the powerpc platform does not properly interact with
the clone and fork system calls, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (Program Check and system crash) via certain
instructions that are executed with the processor in the Transactional
state.
