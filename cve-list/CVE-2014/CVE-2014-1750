Open redirect vulnerability in nokia-mapsplaces.php in the Nokia Maps
& Places plugin 1.6.6 for WordPress allows remote attackers to
redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via
a URL in the href parameter to page/place.html.  NOTE: this was
originally reported as a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but
this may be inaccurate.
