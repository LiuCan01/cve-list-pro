Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit
after an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes
it easier for remote attackers to conduct traffic-confirmation attacks
by using the pattern of RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means of
communicating information about hidden service names.
