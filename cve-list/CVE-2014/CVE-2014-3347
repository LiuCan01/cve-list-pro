Cisco IOS 15.1(4)M2 on Cisco 1800 ISR devices, when the ISDN Basic
Rate Interface is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (device hang) by leveraging knowledge of the ISDN phone
number to trigger an interrupt timer collision during entropy
collection, leading to an invalid state of the hardware encryption
module, aka Bug ID CSCul77897.
