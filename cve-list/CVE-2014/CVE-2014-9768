** DISPUTED ** IBM Tivoli NetView Access Services (NVAS) allows remote
authenticated users to gain privileges by entering the ADM command and
modifying a "page ID" field to the EMSPG2 transaction code.  NOTE: the
vendor's perspective is that configuration and use of available
security controls in the NVAS product mitigates the reported
vulnerability.
