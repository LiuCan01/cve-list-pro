modules/webaudio/BiquadDSPKernel.cpp in the Web Audio API
implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94,
does not properly consider concurrent threads during attempts to
update biquad filter coefficients, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (read of uninitialized memory) via crafted
API calls.
