The Group Policy implementation in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2,
Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows
8.1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2 does not properly handle
distribution of passwords, which allows remote authenticated users to
obtain sensitive credential information and consequently gain
privileges by leveraging access to the SYSVOL share, as exploited in
the wild in May 2014, aka "Group Policy Preferences Password Elevation
of Privilege Vulnerability."
