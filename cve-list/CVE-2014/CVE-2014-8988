MantisBT before 1.2.18 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the
$g_download_attachments_threshold and $g_view_attachments_threshold
restrictions and read attachments for private projects by leveraging
access to a project that does not restrict access to attachments and a
request to the download URL.
