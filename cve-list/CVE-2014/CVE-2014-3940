The Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not properly consider the
presence of hugetlb entries, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption or system crash) by accessing
certain memory locations, as demonstrated by triggering a race
condition via numa_maps read operations during hugepage migration,
related to fs/proc/task_mmu.c and mm/mempolicy.c.
