FileMaker Pro before 13 and Pro Advanced before 13 does not verify
X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a
crafted certificate.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incorrect fix for CVE-2013-2319.
