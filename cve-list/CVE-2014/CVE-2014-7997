The DHCP implementation in Cisco IOS on Aironet access points does not
properly handle error conditions with short leases and unsuccessful
lease-renewal attempts, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (device restart) by triggering a transition into a
recovery state that was intended to involve a network-interface
restart but actually involves a full device restart, aka Bug ID
CSCtn16281.
