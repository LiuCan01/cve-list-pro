Reference: CONFIRM:https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/express-no-charset-in-content-type-header

The Express web framework before 3.11 and 4.x before 4.5 for Node.js
does not provide a charset field in HTTP Content-Type headers in 400
level responses, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via characters in a non-standard
encoding.
