The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation in Microsoft Windows
7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2
does not properly encrypt sessions, which makes it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information by
sniffing the network or modify session content by sending crafted RDP
packets, aka "RDP MAC Vulnerability."
