CA 2E Web Option r8.1.2 accepts a predictable substring of a W2E_SSNID
session token in place of the entire token, which allows remote
attackers to hijack sessions by changing characters at the end of this
substring, as demonstrated by terminating a session via a modified
SSNID parameter to web2edoc/close.htm.
