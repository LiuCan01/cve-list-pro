The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.2 through 2013.2.2
does not properly put VMs into RESCUE status, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of
service (resource consumption) by requesting the VM be put into rescue
and then deleting the image.
