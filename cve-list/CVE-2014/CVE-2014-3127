dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style
encoded filenames" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch
program lacks this feature, which triggers an interaction error that
allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and
modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source
package.  NOTE: this can be considered a release engineering problem
in the effort to fix CVE-2014-0471.
