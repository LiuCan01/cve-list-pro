The IPv6 implementation in Microsoft Windows 8, Windows Server 2012,
and Windows RT does not properly validate packets, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (system hang) via crafted
ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets, aka "TCP/IP Version 6 (IPv6)
Denial of Service Vulnerability."
