Libgcrypt before 1.5.4, as used in GnuPG and other products, does not
properly perform ciphertext normalization and ciphertext
randomization, which makes it easier for physically proximate
attackers to conduct key-extraction attacks by leveraging the ability
to collect voltage data from exposed metal, a different vector than
CVE-2013-4576.
