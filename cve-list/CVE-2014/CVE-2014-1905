Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in ls/vw_snapshots.php in the
VideoWhisper Live Streaming Integration plugin before 4.29.5 for
WordPress allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by
uploading a file with a double extension, and then accessing the file
via a direct request to a
wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-live-streaming-integration/ls/snapshots/
pathname, as demonstrated by a .php.jpg filename.
