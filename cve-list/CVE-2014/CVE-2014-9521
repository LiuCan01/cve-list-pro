Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in uploadScript.php in
InfiniteWP Admin Panel before 2.4.4, when the allWPFiles query
parameter is set, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
uploading a file with a double extension, then accessing it via a
direct request to the file in the uploads directory, as demonstrated
by the .php.swp filename.
