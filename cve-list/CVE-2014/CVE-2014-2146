The Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW) functionality in Cisco IOS, possibly
15.4 and earlier, and IOS XE, possibly 3.13 and earlier, mishandles
zone checking for existing sessions, which allows remote attackers to
bypass intended resource-access restrictions via spoofed traffic that
matches one of these sessions, aka Bug IDs CSCun94946 and CSCun96847.
