A certain Apple patch for OpenSSL in Apple OS X 10.9.2 and earlier
uses a Trust Evaluation Agent (TEA) feature without terminating
certain TLS/SSL handshakes as specified in the SSL_CTX_set_verify
callback function's documentation, which allows remote attackers to
bypass extra verification within a custom application via a crafted
certificate chain that is acceptable to TEA but not acceptable to that
application.
