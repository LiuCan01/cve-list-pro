Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1,
Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and
R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 do not properly restrict the exchange
of keyboard and mouse data between programs at different integrity
levels, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
by leveraging control over a low-integrity process to launch the
On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) and then upload a crafted application, aka
"On-Screen Keyboard Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability."
