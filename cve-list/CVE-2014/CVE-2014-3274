Cisco TelePresence System (CTS) 6.0(.5)(5) and earlier falls back to
HTTP when certain HTTPS sessions cannot be established, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive directory information
by leveraging a network position between CTS and Cisco Unified
Communications Manager (UCM) to block HTTPS traffic, aka Bug ID
CSCuj26326.
