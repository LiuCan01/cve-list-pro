The Meeting Server in IBM Sametime 8.x through 8.5.2.1 and 9.x through
9.0.0.1 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for
an unspecified cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this
cookie, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-3984.
