The IBM Notes Traveler Companion application 1.0 and 1.1 before
201411010515 for Window Phone, as distributed in IBM Notes Traveler
9.0.1, does not properly restrict the number of executions of the
automatic configuration option, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to capture credentials by conducting a phishing attack
involving an encrypted e-mail message.
