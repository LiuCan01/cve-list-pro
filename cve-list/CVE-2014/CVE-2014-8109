mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and
2.4.x through 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which
the same Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments
within different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by
leveraging multiple Require directives, as demonstrated by a
configuration that specifies authorization for one group to access a
certain directory, and authorization for a second group to access a
second directory.
