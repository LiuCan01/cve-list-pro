sosreport in Red Hat sos 1.7 and earlier on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) 5 produces an archive with an fstab file potentially containing
cleartext passwords, and lacks a warning about reviewing this archive
to detect included passwords, which might allow remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to a
technical-support data stream.
