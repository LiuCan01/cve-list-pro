Node.js 0.8 before 0.8.28 and 0.10 before 0.10.30 does not consider
the possibility of recursive processing that triggers V8 garbage
collection in conjunction with a V8 interrupt, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
application crash) via deep JSON objects whose parsing lets this
interrupt mask an overflow of the program stack.
