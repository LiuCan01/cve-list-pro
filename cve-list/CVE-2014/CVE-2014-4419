The network-statistics interface in the kernel in Apple iOS before 8
and Apple TV before 7 does not properly initialize memory, which
allows attackers to obtain sensitive memory-content and memory-layout
information via a crafted application, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2014-4371, CVE-2014-4420, and CVE-2014-4421.
