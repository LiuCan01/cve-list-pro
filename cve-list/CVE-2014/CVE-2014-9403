The CWebAdminMod::ChanPage function in modules/webadmin.cpp in ZNC
before 1.4 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) by adding a channel with
the same name as an existing channel but without the leading #
character, related to a "use-after-delete" error.
