webservice/upload.php in Moodle 2.6.x before 2.6.6 and 2.7.x before
2.7.3 does not ensure that a file upload is for a private or draft
area, which allows remote authenticated users to upload files
containing JavaScript, and consequently conduct cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks, by specifying the profile-picture area.
