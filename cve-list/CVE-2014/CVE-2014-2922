The getObjectByToken function in Newsletter.php in the
Pimcore_Tool_Newsletter module in pimcore 1.4.9 through 2.1.0 does not
properly handle an object obtained by unserializing a pathname, which
allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks and
delete arbitrary files via vectors involving a
Zend_Http_Response_Stream object.
