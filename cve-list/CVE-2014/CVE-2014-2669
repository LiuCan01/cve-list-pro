Multiple integer overflows in contrib/hstore/hstore_io.c in PostgreSQL
9.0.x before 9.0.16, 9.1.x before 9.1.12, 9.2.x before 9.2.7, and
9.3.x before 9.3.3 allow remote authenticated users to have
unspecified impact via vectors related to the (1) hstore_recv, (2)
hstore_from_arrays, and (3) hstore_from_array functions in
contrib/hstore/hstore_io.c; and the (4) hstoreArrayToPairs function in
contrib/hstore/hstore_op.c, which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE:
this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2014-0064 because it has a different set
of affected versions.
