The NavigationScheduler::schedulePageBlock function in
core/loader/NavigationScheduler.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome
before 38.0.2125.101, does not properly provide substitute data for
pages blocked by the XSS auditor, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via a crafted web site.
