stunnel before 5.00, when using fork threading, does not properly
update the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG),
which causes subsequent children with the same process ID to use the
same entropy pool and allows remote attackers to obtain private keys
for EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates.
