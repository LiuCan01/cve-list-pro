Reference: MISC:http://websecurity.com.ua/7112

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in D-Link
DAP 1150 with firmware 1.2.94 allow remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of administrators for requests that (1) enable or (2)
disable the DMZ in the Firewall/DMZ section via a request to index.cgi
or (3) add, (4) modify, or (5) delete URL-filter settings in the
Control/URL-filter section via a request to index.cgi, as demonstrated
by adding a rule that blocks access to google.com.
