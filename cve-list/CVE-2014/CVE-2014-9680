sudo before 1.8.12 does not ensure that the TZ environment variable is
associated with a zoneinfo file, which allows local users to open
arbitrary files for read access (but not view file contents) by
running a program within an sudo session, as demonstrated by
interfering with terminal output, discarding kernel-log messages, or
repositioning tape drives.
