Use-after-free vulnerability in the V8 bindings in Blink, as used in
Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by
leveraging improper use of HashMap add operations instead of HashMap
set operations, related to bindings/core/v8/DOMWrapperMap.h and
bindings/core/v8/SerializedScriptValue.cpp.
