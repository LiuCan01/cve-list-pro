** DISPUTED ** The openssl extension in Ruby 2.x does not properly
maintain the state of process memory after a file is reopened, which
allows remote attackers to spoof signatures within the context of a
Ruby script that attempts signature verification after performing a
certain sequence of filesystem operations.  NOTE: this issue has been
disputed by the Ruby OpenSSL team and third parties, who state that
the original demonstration PoC contains errors and redundant or
unnecessarily-complex code that does not appear to be related to a
demonstration of the issue. As of 20140502, CVE is not aware of any
public comment by the original researcher.
