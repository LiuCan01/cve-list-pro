The needSamples method in AudioOutputSpeech.cpp in the client in
Mumble 1.2.4 and the 1.2.3 pre-release snapshots, Mumble for iOS 1.1
through 1.2.2, and MumbleKit before commit
fd190328a9b24d37382b269a5674b0c0c7a7e36d does not check the return
value of the opus_decode_float function, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a crafted Opus voice packet, which triggers an error in
opus_decode_float, a conversion of a negative integer to an unsigned
integer, and a heap-based buffer over-read and over-write.
