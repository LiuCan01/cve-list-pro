The LDAPLoginModule implementation in the Java Authentication and
Authorization Service (JAAS) in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.10.1
allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with an
empty password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated
bind. NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT2 due to different
vulnerability types. See CVE-2015-6524 for the use of wildcard
operators in usernames.
