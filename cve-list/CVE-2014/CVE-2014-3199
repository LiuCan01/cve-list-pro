The wrap function in bindings/core/v8/custom/V8EventCustom.cpp in the
V8 bindings in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101,
has an erroneous fallback outcome for wrapper-selection failures,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors
that trigger stopping a worker process that had been handling an Event
object.
