Reference: FULLDISC:20140902 Reflected XSS Attacks vulnerabilities used MIME Sniffing in Facebook Messenger and Facebook App for iOS.
Reference: URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/13

** DISPUTED ** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
Facebook app 14.0 and the Facebook Messenger app 10.0 for iOS allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted
filename extension that is improperly handled during MIME sniffing of
chat traffic.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this
report, because the user must accept an interstitial warning before
the HTML file content is rendered, and because the HTML content's
origin is a sandbox domain.
