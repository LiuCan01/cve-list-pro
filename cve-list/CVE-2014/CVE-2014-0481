The default configuration for the file upload handling system in
Django before 1.4.14, 1.5.x before 1.5.9, 1.6.x before 1.6.6, and 1.7
before release candidate 3 uses a sequential file name generation
process when a file with a conflicting name is uploaded, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by
unloading a multiple files with the same name.
