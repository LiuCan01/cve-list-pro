EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7 SP2 P17, 7.0 through P15, and
7.1 before P08 does not properly check authorization for subtypes of
protected system types, which allows remote authenticated users to
obtain super-user privileges for system-object creation, and bypass
intended restrictions on data access and server actions, via
unspecified vectors.
