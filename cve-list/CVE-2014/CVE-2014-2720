IZArc 4.1.8 displays a file's name on the basis of a ZIP archive's
Central Directory entry, but launches this file on the basis of a ZIP
archive's local file header, which allows user-assisted remote
attackers to conduct file-extension spoofing attacks via a modified
Central Directory, as demonstrated by unintended code execution
prompted by a .jpg extension in the Central Directory and a .exe
extension in the local file header.
