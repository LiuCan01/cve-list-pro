Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager (CDM) in Unified CDM
Platform Software before 4.4.2 has a hardcoded SSH private key, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to the support
and root accounts by extracting this key from a binary file found in a
different installation of the product, aka Bug ID CSCud41130.
