Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.241 and 14.x before 14.0.0.176 on
Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.400 on Linux, Adobe AIR before
14.0.0.178 on Windows and OS X and before 14.0.0.179 on Android, Adobe
AIR SDK before 14.0.0.178, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before
14.0.0.178 do not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows
remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
against JSONP endpoints, and obtain sensitive information, via a
crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set
requirements of a callback API, in conjunction with a manipulation
involving a '$' (dollar sign) or '(' (open parenthesis) character.
NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2014-4671.
