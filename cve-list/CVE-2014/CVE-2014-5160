** DISPUTED ** Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in crs.exe
in the Cell Request Service in HP Data Protector allow remote
attackers to create arbitrary files via an opcode-1091 request, or
create or delete arbitrary files via an opcode-305 request.  NOTE: the
vendor reportedly asserts that this behavior is "by design."
