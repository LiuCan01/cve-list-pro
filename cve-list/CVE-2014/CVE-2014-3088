stconf.nsf in IBM Sametime Meeting Server 8.5.1 relies on the client
to validate the file format used in wAttach?OpenForm
multipart/form-data POST requests, which allows remote authenticated
users to bypass intended upload restrictions by modifying the
Content-Type header and file extension, as demonstrated by replacing a
text/plain .txt upload with an application/octet-stream .exe upload.
