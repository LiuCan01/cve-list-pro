Use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through
11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service (memory corruption) via vectors related to the
CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup function, as exploited in the wild
in April 2014.  NOTE: this issue originally emphasized VGX.DLL, but
Microsoft clarified that "VGX.DLL does not contain the vulnerable code
leveraged in this exploit. Disabling VGX.DLL is an exploit-specific
workaround that provides an immediate, effective workaround to help
block known attacks."
