Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 6.2.2, when
using a Java Security Manager (JSM), does not properly apply
permissions defined by a policy file, which causes applications to be
granted the java.security.AllPermission permission and allows remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
