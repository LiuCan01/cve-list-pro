sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through 5.4.36, 5.5.x
through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap is used to read a
.php file, does not properly consider the mapping's length during
processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks
a newline character, which causes an out-of-bounds read and might (1)
allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi
process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2)
trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in
memory locations adjacent to the mapping.
