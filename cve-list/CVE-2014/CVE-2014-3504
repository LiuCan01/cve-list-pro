The (1) serf_ssl_cert_issuer, (2) serf_ssl_cert_subject, and (3)
serf_ssl_cert_certificate functions in Serf 0.2.0 through 1.3.x before
1.3.7 does not properly handle a NUL byte in a domain name in the
subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a
crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
