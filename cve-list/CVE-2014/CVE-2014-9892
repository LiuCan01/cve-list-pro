The snd_compr_tstamp function in sound/core/compress_offload.c in the
Linux kernel through 4.7, as used in Android before 2016-08-05 on
Nexus 5 and 7 (2013) devices, does not properly initialize a timestamp
data structure, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information
via a crafted application, aka Android internal bug 28770164 and
Qualcomm internal bug CR568717.
