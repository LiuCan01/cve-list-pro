The boot_linux_from_mmc function in app/aboot/aboot.c in the Little
Kernel (LK) bootloader, as distributed with Qualcomm Innovation Center
(QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does
not properly validate a certain address value, which allows attackers
to write data to a controllable memory location by leveraging the
ability to initiate an attempted boot of an arbitrary image.
