Heap-based buffer overflow in the FFmpegVideoDecoder::GetVideoBuffer
function in media/filters/ffmpeg_video_decoder.cc in Google Chrome
before 35.0.1916.153 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging
VideoFrame data structures that are too small for proper interaction
with an underlying FFmpeg library.
