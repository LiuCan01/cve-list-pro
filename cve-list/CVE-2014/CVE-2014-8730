The SSL profiles component in F5 BIG-IP LTM, APM, and ASM 10.0.0
through 10.2.4 and 11.0.0 through 11.5.1, AAM 11.4.0 through 11.5.1,
AFM 11.3.0 through 11.5.1, Analytics 11.0.0 through 11.5.1, Edge
Gateway, WebAccelerator, and WOM 10.1.0 through 10.2.4 and 11.0.0
through 11.3.0, PEM 11.3.0 through 11.6.0, and PSM 10.0.0 through
10.2.4 and 11.0.0 through 11.4.1 and BIG-IQ Cloud and Security 4.0.0
through 4.4.0 and Device 4.2.0 through 4.4.0, when using TLS 1.x
before TLS 1.2, does not properly check CBC padding bytes when
terminating connections, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle
attackers to obtain cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack, a
variant of CVE-2014-3566 (aka POODLE).  NOTE: the scope of this
identifier is limited to the F5 implementation only. Other vulnerable
implementations should receive their own CVE ID, since this is not a
vulnerability within the design of TLS 1.x itself.
