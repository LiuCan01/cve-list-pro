Juniper JunosE before 13.3.3p0-1, 14.x before 14.3.2, and 15.x before
15.1.0, when DEBUG severity icmpTraffic logging is enabled, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (SRP reset) via a
crafted ICMP packet to the (1) interface or (2) loopback IP address,
which triggers a processor exception in ip_RxData_8.
