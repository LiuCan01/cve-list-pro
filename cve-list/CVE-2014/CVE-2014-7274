The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify
that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common
Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive
information via a crafted certificate from a recognized Certification
Authority.
