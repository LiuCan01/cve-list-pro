The Remote Mobile Access Subsystem in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager (CM) 10.0(1) and earlier does not properly validate the
Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of an X.509 certificate, which
allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof VCS core devices via a
crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority,
aka Bug ID CSCuq86376.
