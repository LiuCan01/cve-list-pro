Use-after-free vulnerability in the nfqnl_zcopy function in
net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue_core.c in the Linux kernel through
3.13.6 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel
memory by leveraging the absence of a certain orphaning operation.
NOTE: the affected code was moved to the skb_zerocopy function in
net/core/skbuff.c before the vulnerability was announced.
