IBM Cognos Mobile 10.1.1 before FP3 IF1, 10.2.0 before FP2 IF1, and
10.2.1 before FP4 IF1 preserves a session between the Cognos Mobile
server and the Cognos Business Intelligence server after a logoff
action on a mobile device, which makes it easier for remote attackers
to bypass intended Business Intelligence restrictions by leveraging
access to authentication data that was captured before this logoff.
