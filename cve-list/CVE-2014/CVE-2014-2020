ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 does not check data types, which
might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by using
a (1) string or (2) array data type in place of a numeric data type,
as demonstrated by an imagecrop function call with a string for the x
dimension value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-7226.
