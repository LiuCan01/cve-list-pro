The IRQ setup in Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when using device passthrough
and configured to support a large number of CPUs, frees certain memory
that may still be intended for use, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
hypervisor crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors
related to an out-of-memory error that triggers a (1) use-after-free
or (2) double free.
