curl and libcurl 7.27.0 through 7.35.0, when running on Windows and
using the SChannel/Winssl TLS backend, does not verify that the server
hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when accessing a URL
that uses a numerical IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
