The ConvolveHorizontally function in Skia, as used in Mozilla Firefox
before 31.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7, and Thunderbird before
24.7, does not properly handle the discarding of image data during
function execution, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code by triggering prolonged image scaling, as demonstrated by scaling
of a high-quality image.
