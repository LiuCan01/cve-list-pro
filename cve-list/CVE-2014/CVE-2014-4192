The Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-C Toolkits (aka Share
for C and C++) processes certain requests for output bytes by
considering only the requested byte count and not the use of cached
bytes, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext
from TLS sessions by recovering the algorithm's inner state, a
different issue than CVE-2007-6755.
