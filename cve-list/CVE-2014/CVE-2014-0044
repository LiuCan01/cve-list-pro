The opus_packet_get_samples_per_frame function in client in Mumble
1.2.4 and the 1.2.3 pre-release snapshots allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted length prefix value,
which triggers a NULL pointer dereference or a heap-based buffer
over-read (aka "out-of-bounds array access").
