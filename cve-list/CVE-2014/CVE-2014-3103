The Web component in IBM Rational ClearQuest 7.1 before 7.1.2.15,
8.0.0 before 8.0.0.12, and 8.0.1 before 8.0.1.5 does not set the
secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its
transmission within an http session.
