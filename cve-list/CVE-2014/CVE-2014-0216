The My Home implementation in the block_html_pluginfile function in
blocks/html/lib.php in Moodle through 2.3.11, 2.4.x before 2.4.10,
2.5.x before 2.5.6, and 2.6.x before 2.6.3 does not properly restrict
file access, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by visiting an HTML block.
