Reference: CONFIRM:https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/crumb_cors_token_disclosure

The Crumb plugin before 3.0.0 for Node.js does not properly restrict
token access in situations where a hapi route handler has CORS
enabled, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information, and potentially obtain the ability to spoof requests to
non-CORS routes, via a crafted web site that is visited by an
application consumer.
