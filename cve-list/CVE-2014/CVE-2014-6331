Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0, 2.1, and
3.0, when a configured SAML Relying Party lacks a sign-out endpoint,
does not properly process logoff actions, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to obtain access by leveraging an unattended
workstation, aka "Active Directory Federation Services Information
Disclosure Vulnerability."
