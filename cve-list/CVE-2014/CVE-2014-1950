Use-after-free vulnerability in the xc_cpupool_getinfo function in Xen
4.1.x through 4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not
properly handle a failure by the xc_cpumap_alloc function, which
allows local users with access to management functions to cause a
denial of service (heap corruption) and possibly gain privileges via
unspecified vectors.
