The default configuration of the Resources plugin 1.0.0 before 1.2.6
for Pivotal Grails 2.0.0 before 2.3.6 does not properly restrict
access to files in the WEB-INF directory, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request.  NOTE:
this identifier has been SPLIT due to different researchers and
different vulnerability types. See CVE-2014-2857 for the META-INF
variant and CVE-2014-2858 for the directory traversal.
