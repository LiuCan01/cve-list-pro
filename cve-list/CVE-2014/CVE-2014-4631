RSA Adaptive Authentication (On-Premise) 6.0.2.1 through 7.1 P3, when
using device binding in a Challenge SOAP call or using the RSA
Adaptive Authentication Integration Adapters with Out-of-Band Phone
(Authentify) functionality, conducts permanent device binding even
when authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication.
