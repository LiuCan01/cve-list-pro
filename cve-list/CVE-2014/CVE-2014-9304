Plex Media Server before 0.9.9.3 allows remote attackers to bypass the
web server whitelist, conduct SSRF attacks, and execute arbitrary
administrative actions via multiple crafted X-Plex-Url headers to
system/proxy, which are inconsistently processed by the request
handler in the backend web server.
