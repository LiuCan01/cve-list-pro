The netback driver in Xen, when using certain Linux versions that do
not allow sleeping in softirq context, allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service ("scheduling while atomic"
error and host crash) via a malformed packet, which causes a mutex to
be taken when trying to disable the interface.
