Ettercap 0.8.1 does not validate certain return values, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) name to the parse_line
function in mdns_spoof/mdns_spoof.c or (2) base64 encoded password to
the dissector_imap function in dissectors/ec_imap.c.
