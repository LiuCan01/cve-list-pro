The WebGL implementation in Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94 does not
ensure that clear calls interact properly with the state of a draw
buffer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(read of uninitialized memory) via a crafted CANVAS element, related
to gpu/command_buffer/service/framebuffer_manager.cc and
gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc.
