GE Healthcare Precision THUNIS-800+ has a default password of (1) 1973
for the factory default System Utilities menu, (2) TH8740 for
installation using TH8740_122_Setup.exe, (3) hrml for "Setup and
Activation" using DSASetup, and (4) an empty string for Shutter
Configuration, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.  NOTE:
since these passwords appear to be used to access functionality during
installation, this issue might not cross privilege boundaries and
might not be a vulnerability.
