Mule Enterprise Management Console (MMC) does not properly restrict
access to handler/securityService.rpc, which allows remote
authenticated users to gain administrator privileges and execute
arbitrary code via a crafted request that adds a new user.  NOTE: this
issue was originally reported for ESB Runtime 3.5.1, but it originates
in MMC.
