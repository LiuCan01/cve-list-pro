Yann Collet LZ4 before r119, when used on certain 32-bit platforms
that allocate memory beyond 0x80000000, does not properly detect
integer overflows, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted Literal Run, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2014-4611.
