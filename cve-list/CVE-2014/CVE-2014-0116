CookieInterceptor in Apache Struts 2.x before 2.3.16.3, when a
wildcard cookiesName value is used, does not properly restrict access
to the getClass method, which allows remote attackers to "manipulate"
the ClassLoader and modify session state via a crafted request.  NOTE:
this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2014-0113.
