WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 7.1.2, Apple Safari before 6.1.5
and 7.x before 7.0.5, and Apple TV before 6.1.2, allows remote

(memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted web site, a
different vulnerability than other WebKit CVEs listed in
APPLE-SA-2014-06-30-1, APPLE-SA-2014-06-30-3, and
APPLE-SA-2014-06-30-4.
