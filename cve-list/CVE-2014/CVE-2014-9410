The vfe31_proc_general function in
drivers/media/video/msm/vfe/msm_vfe31.c in the MSM-VFE31 driver for
the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC)
Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not
validate a certain id value, which allows attackers to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via an application
that makes a crafted ioctl call.
