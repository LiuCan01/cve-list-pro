The reverse-proxy feature in IBM Security Access Manager (ISAM) for
Web 8.0 with firmware 8.0.0.2 and 8.0.0.3 interprets the
jct-nist-compliance parameter in the opposite of the intended manner,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by leveraging weak SSL encryption settings that lack NIST
SP 800-131A compliance.
