Unity before 7.2.3 and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, as used in Ubuntu, does not
properly take focus of the keyboard when switching to the lock screen,
which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the lock screen
by (1) leveraging a machine that had text selected when locking or (2)
resuming from a suspension.
