Reference: FULLDISC:20141121 AST-2014-014: High call load may result in hung channels in ConfBridge.

ConfBridge in Asterisk 11.x before 11.14.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.6
before 11.6-cert8 does not properly handle state changes, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (channel hang and memory
consumption) by causing transitions to be delayed, which triggers a
state change from hung up to waiting for media.
