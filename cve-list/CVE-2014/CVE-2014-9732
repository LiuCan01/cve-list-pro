The cabd_extract function in cabd.c in libmspack before 0.5 does not
properly maintain decompression callbacks in certain cases where an
invalid file follows a valid file, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
crash) via a crafted CAB archive.
