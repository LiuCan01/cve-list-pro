The MSCAPI/MSCNG interface implementation in GSKit in IBM Rational
ClearCase 7.1.2.x before 7.1.2.17, 8.0.0.x before 8.0.0.14, and
8.0.1.x before 8.0.1.7 does not properly generate random numbers,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors.
