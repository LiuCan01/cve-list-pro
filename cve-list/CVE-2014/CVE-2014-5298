FileUploadsFilter.php in X2Engine 4.1.7 and earlier, when running on
case-insensitive file systems, allows remote attackers to bypass the
upload blacklist and conduct unrestricted file upload attacks by
uploading a file with an executable extension that contains uppercase
letters, as demonstrated using a PHP program.
