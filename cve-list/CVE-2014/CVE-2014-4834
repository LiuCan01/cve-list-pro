IBM WebSphere Commerce 6.x through 6.0.0.11 and 7.x through 7.0.0.8
does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
consumption, and application crash) via a crafted XML document
containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar issue
to CVE-2003-1564.
