The HTTP clients in the (1) httplib, (2) urllib, (3) urllib2, and (4)
xmlrpclib libraries in CPython (aka Python) 2.x before 2.7.9 and 3.x
before 3.4.3, when accessing an HTTPS URL, do not (a) check the
certificate against a trust store or verify that the server hostname
matches a domain name in the subject's (b) Common Name or (c)
subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate.
