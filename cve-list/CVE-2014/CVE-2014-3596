The getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly
verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's
Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a
certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field
that is not the CN field.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5784.
