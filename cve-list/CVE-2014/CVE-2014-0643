Reference: BUGTRAQ:20140512 ESA-2014-027: RSA NetWitness and RSA Security Analytics Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2014-05/0052.html

EMC RSA NetWitness before 9.8.5.19 and RSA Security Analytics before
10.2.4 and 10.3.x before 10.3.2, when Kerberos PAM is enabled, do not
require a password, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication by leveraging knowledge of a valid account name.
