The Festo CECX-X-C1 Modular Master Controller with CoDeSys and
CECX-X-M1 Modular Controller with CoDeSys and SoftMotion do not
require authentication for connections to certain TCP ports, which
allows remote attackers to (1) modify the configuration via a request
to the debug service on port 4000 or (2) delete log entries via a
request to the log service on port 4001.
