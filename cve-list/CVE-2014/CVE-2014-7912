The get_option function in dhcp.c in dhcpcd before 6.2.0, as used in
dhcpcd 5.x in Android before 5.1 and other products, does not validate
the relationship between length fields and the amount of data, which
allows remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service (memory corruption) via a large length value of an option
in a DHCPACK message.
