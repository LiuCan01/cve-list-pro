The chrome_pdf::CopyImage function in pdf/draw_utils.cc in the PDFium
component in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101 does not properly
validate image-data dimensions, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via unknown vectors.
