Buffer overflow in A10 Networks Advanced Core Operating System (ACOS)
before 2.7.0-p6 and 2.7.1 before 2.7.1-P1_55 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a long session id in the URI to sys_reboot.html.  NOTE: some
of these details are obtained from third party information.
