Reference: CONFIRM:http://code.lightwitch.org/metronome/rev/49f47277a411

plugins/mod_compression.lua in Lightwitch Metronome through 3.4 does
not properly restrict the processing of compressed XML elements, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via a crafted XMPP stream, aka an "xmppbomb" attack.
