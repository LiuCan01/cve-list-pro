The Expressway component in Cisco TelePresence Video Communication
Server (VCS) uses the same default X.509 certificate across different
customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers
to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL sessions by
leveraging the certificate's trust relationship, aka Bug ID
CSCue07471.
