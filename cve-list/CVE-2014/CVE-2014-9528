SQL injection vulnerability in the actionIndex function in
protected/modules_core/notification/controllers/ListController.php in
HumHub 0.10.0-rc.1 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to
execute arbitrary SQL commands via the from parameter to index.php.
NOTE: this can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
a request that causes an error.
