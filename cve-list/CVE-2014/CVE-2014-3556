The STARTTLS implementation in mail/ngx_mail_smtp_handler.c in the
SMTP proxy in nginx 1.5.x and 1.6.x before 1.6.1 and 1.7.x before
1.7.4 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP
sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is
in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar
issue to CVE-2011-0411.
