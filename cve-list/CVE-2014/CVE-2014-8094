Integer overflow in the ProcDRI2GetBuffers function in the DRI2
extension in X.Org Server (aka xserver and xorg-server) 1.7.0 through
1.16.x before 1.16.3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a
denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
crafted request, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.
