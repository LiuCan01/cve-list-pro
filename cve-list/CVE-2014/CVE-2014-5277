Docker before 1.3.1 and docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when
the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain
authentication and image data by leveraging a network position between
the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.
