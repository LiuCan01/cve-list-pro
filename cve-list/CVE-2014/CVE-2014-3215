seunshare in policycoreutils 2.2.5 is owned by root with 4755
permissions, and executes programs in a way that changes the
relationship between the setuid system call and the getresuid saved
set-user-ID value, which makes it easier for local users to gain
privileges by leveraging a program that mistakenly expected that it
could permanently drop privileges.
