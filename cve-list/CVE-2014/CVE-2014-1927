The shell_quote function in python-gnupg 0.3.5 does not properly quote
strings, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
code via shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors, as demonstrated
using "$(" command-substitution sequences, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2014-1928.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7323.
