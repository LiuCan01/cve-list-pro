IBM Curam Social Program Management (SPM) 5.2 before SP6 EP6, 6.0 SP2
before EP26, 6.0.4 before 6.0.4.6, and 6.0.5 before 6.0.5.6 requires
failed-login handling for web-service accounts to have the same
lockout policy as for standard user accounts, which makes it easier
for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (web-service outage)
by making many login attempts with a valid caseworker account name.
