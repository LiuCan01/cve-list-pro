** DISPUTED ** The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c
in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a
free operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the
standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation unreachable.
