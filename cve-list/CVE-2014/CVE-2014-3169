Use-after-free vulnerability in core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp in the DOM
implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact by leveraging script execution that occurs
before notification of node removal.
