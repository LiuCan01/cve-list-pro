SQL injection vulnerability in incl/create.inc.php in Installatron GQ
File Manager 0.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the create parameter to index.php.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by creating a file
that generates an error.  NOTE: this issue was originally incorrectly
mapped to CVE-2014-1137; see CVE-2014-1137 for more information.
