Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.32 do not consider
the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension in deciding whether to trust an
OCSP responder, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information by sniffing the network during a session in
which there was an incorrect decision to accept a compromised and
revoked certificate.
