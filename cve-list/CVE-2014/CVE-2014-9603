The vmd_decode function in libavcodec/vmdvideo.c in FFmpeg before
2.5.2 does not validate the relationship between a certain length
value and the frame width, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via crafted Sierra VMD video data.
