Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in ajax/upload.php in ownCloud
before 5.0, when running on Windows, allows remote authenticated users
to bypass intended access restrictions, upload files with arbitrary
names, and execute arbitrary code via an Alternate Data Stream (ADS)
syntax in the filename parameter, as demonstrated using
.htaccess::$DATA to upload a PHP program.
