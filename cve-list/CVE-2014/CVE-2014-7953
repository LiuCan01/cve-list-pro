Race condition in the bindBackupAgent method in the
ActivityManagerService in Android 4.4.4 allows local users with adb
shell access to execute arbitrary code or any valid package as system
by running "pm install" with the target apk, and simultaneously
running a crafted script to process logcat's output looking for a
dexopt line, which once found should execute bindBackupAgent with the
uid member of the ApplicationInfo parameter set to 1000.
