FreeBSD 9.1, 9.2, and 10.0, when compiling OpenSSH with Kerberos
support, uses incorrect library ordering when linking sshd, which
causes symbols to be resolved incorrectly and allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (sshd deadlock and prevention of new
connections) by ending multiple connections before authentication is
completed.
