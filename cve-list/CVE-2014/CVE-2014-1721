Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.116, does not

to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code, as demonstrated
by improper handling of a heap allocation of a number outside the
Small Integer (aka smi) range.
