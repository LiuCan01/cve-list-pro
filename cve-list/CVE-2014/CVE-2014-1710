The AsyncPixelTransfersCompletedQuery::End function in
gpu/command_buffer/service/query_manager.cc in Google Chrome, as used
in Google Chrome OS before 33.0.1750.152, does not check whether a
certain position is within the bounds of a shared-memory segment,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (GPU
command-buffer memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via unknown vectors.
