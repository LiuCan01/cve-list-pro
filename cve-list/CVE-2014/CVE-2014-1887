The DrinkedIn BarFinder application for Android, when Adobe PhoneGap
2.9.0 or earlier is used, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
JavaScript code, and consequently obtain sensitive fine-geolocation
information, by leveraging control over one of a number of adult
sites, as demonstrated by (1) freelifetimecheating.com and (2)
www.babesroulette.com.
