Huawei Eudemon8000E firewall with software V200R001C01SPC800 and
earlier versions allows users to log in to the device using Telnet or
SSH. When an attacker sends to the device a mass of TCP packets with
special structure, the logging process becomes slow and users may be
unable to log in to the device.
