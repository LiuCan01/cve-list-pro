The image_verify function in platform/msm_shared/image_verify.c in the
Little Kernel (LK) bootloader, as distributed with Qualcomm Innovation
Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other
products, does not check whether a certain digest size is consistent
with the RSA_public_decrypt API specification, which makes it easier
for attackers to bypass boot-image authentication requirements via
trailing data.
