Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Pods
plugin before 2.5 for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of administrators for requests that (1) conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the toggled parameter in a
toggle action in the pods-components page to wp-admin/admin.php, (2)
delete a pod in a delete action in the pods page to
wp-admin/admin.php, (3) reset pod settings and data via the pods_reset
parameter in the pod-settings page to wp-admin/admin.php, (4)
deactivate and reset pod data via the pods_reset_deactivate parameter
in the pod-settings page to wp-admin/admin.php, (5) delete the admin
role via the id parameter in a delete action in the
pods-component-roles-and-capabilities page to wp-admin/admin.php, or
(6) enable "roles and capabilities" in a toggle action in the
pods-components page to wp-admin/admin.php.
