Reference: BUGTRAQ:20140214 ESA-2014-009: RSA BSAFE SSL-J Multiple Vulnerabilities
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2014-02/0061.html

The (1) JSAFE and (2) JSSE APIs in EMC RSA BSAFE SSL-J 5.x before
5.1.3 and 6.x before 6.0.2 make it easier for remote attackers to
bypass intended cryptographic protection mechanisms by triggering
application-data processing during the TLS handshake, a time at which
the data is both unencrypted and unauthenticated.
