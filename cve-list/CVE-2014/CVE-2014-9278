The OpenSSH server, as used in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
and when running in a Kerberos environment, allows remote
authenticated users to log in as another user when they are listed in
the .k5users file of that user, which might bypass intended
authentication requirements that would force a local login.
