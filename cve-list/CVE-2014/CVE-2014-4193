The TLS implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-Java Toolkits (aka Share for
Java) supports the Extended Random extension during use of the
Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by requesting long nonces from a
server, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.
