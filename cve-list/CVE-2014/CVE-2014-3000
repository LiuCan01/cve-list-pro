The TCP reassembly function in the inet module in FreeBSD 8.3 before
p16, 8.4 before p9, 9.1 before p12, 9.2 before p5, and 10.0 before p2
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (undefined memory
access and system crash) or possibly read system memory via multiple
crafted packets, related to moving a reassemble queue entry to the
segment list when the queue is full.
