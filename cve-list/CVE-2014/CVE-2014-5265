The Incutio XML-RPC (IXR) Library, as used in WordPress before 3.9.2
and Drupal 6.x before 6.33 and 7.x before 7.31, permits entity
declarations without considering recursion during entity expansion,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and
CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number
of nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
