Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.131 on Windows
and OS X and before 34.0.1847.132 on Linux, does not properly store
internationalization metadata, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions by leveraging "type confusion" and
reading property values, related to i18n.js and runtime.cc.
