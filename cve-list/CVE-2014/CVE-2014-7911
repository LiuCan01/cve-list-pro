Reference: FULLDISC:20141119 CVE-2014-7911: Android <5.0 Privilege Escalation using ObjectInputStream

luni/src/main/java/java/io/ObjectInputStream.java in the
java.io.ObjectInputStream implementation in Android before 5.0.0 does
not verify that deserialization will result in an object that met the
requirements for serialization, which allows attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a crafted finalize method for a serialized object
in an ArrayMap Parcel within an intent sent to system_service, as
demonstrated by the finalize method of android.os.BinderProxy, aka Bug
15874291.
