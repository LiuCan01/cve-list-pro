The seg_write_packet function in libavformat/segment.c in ffmpeg 2.1.4
and earlier does not free the correct memory location, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service ("invalid memory
handler") and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted video that
triggers a use after free.
