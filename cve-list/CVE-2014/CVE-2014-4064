The kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server
2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows
Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 do not properly
handle use of the paged kernel pool for allocation of uninitialized
memory, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information about
kernel addresses via a crafted application, aka "Windows Kernel Pool
Allocation Vulnerability."
