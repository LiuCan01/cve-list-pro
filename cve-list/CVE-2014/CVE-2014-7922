The GoogleAuthUtil.getToken method in the Google Play services SDK
before 2015 sets parameters in OAuth token requests upon finding a
corresponding _opt_ parameter in the Bundle extras argument, which
allows attackers to bypass an intended consent dialog and retrieve
tokens for arbitrary OAuth scopes including the SID and LSID scopes,
and consequently obtain access to a Google account, via a crafted
application, as demonstrated by setting the has_permission=1 parameter
value upon finding _opt_has_permission in that argument.
