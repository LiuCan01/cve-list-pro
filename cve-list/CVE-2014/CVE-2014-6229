Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/7135ec229882370a00411aa50030eada6034cc1b

The HashContext class in hphp/runtime/ext/ext_hash.cpp in Facebook
HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) before 3.3.0 incorrectly expects that a
certain key string uses '0' for termination, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging read access
beyond the end of the string, and makes it easier for remote attackers
to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging truncation
of a string containing an internal '0' character.
