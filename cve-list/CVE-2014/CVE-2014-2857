The default configuration of the Resources plugin 1.0.0 before 1.2.6
for Pivotal Grails 2.0.0 through 2.3.6 does not properly restrict
access to files in the META-INF directory, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request.  NOTE:
this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2014-0053 due to different researchers
per ADT5.
