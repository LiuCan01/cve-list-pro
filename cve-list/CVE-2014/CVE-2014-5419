GE Multilink ML800, ML1200, ML1600, and ML2400 switches with firmware
4.2.1 and earlier and Multilink ML810, ML3000, and ML3100 switches
with firmware 5.2.0 and earlier use the same RSA private key across
different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain the cleartext content of network traffic by
reading this key from a firmware image and then sniffing the network.
