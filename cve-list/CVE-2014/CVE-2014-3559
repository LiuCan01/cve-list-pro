The oVirt storage backend in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.4
does not wipe memory snapshots when deleting a VM, even when
wipe-after-delete (WAD) is configured for the VM's disk, which allows
remote authenticated users with certain credentials to read portions
of the deleted VM's memory and obtain sensitive information via an
uninitialized storage volume.
