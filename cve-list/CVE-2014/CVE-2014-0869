The decrypt function in RICOS in IBM Algo Credit Limits (aka ACLM)
4.5.0 through 4.7.0 before 4.7.0.03 FP5 in IBM Algorithmics does not
require a key, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
cleartext passwords by sniffing the network and then providing a
string argument to this function.
