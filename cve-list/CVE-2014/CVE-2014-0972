The kgsl graphics driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm
Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and
other products, does not properly prevent write access to IOMMU
context registers, which allows local users to select a custom page
table, and consequently write to arbitrary memory locations, by using
a crafted GPU command stream to modify the contents of a certain
register.
