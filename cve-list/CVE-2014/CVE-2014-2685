The GenericConsumer class in the Consumer component in ZendOpenId
before 2.0.2 and the Zend_OpenId_Consumer class in Zend Framework 1
before 1.12.4 violate the OpenID 2.0 protocol by ensuring only that at
least one field is signed, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication by leveraging an assertion from an OpenID provider.
