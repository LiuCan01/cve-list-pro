Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component in Oracle
Database Server 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1, and 12.1.0.2
allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the January 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
the researcher's claim that this is a stack-based buffer overflow in
DBMS_AW.EXECUTE, which allows code execution via a long Current
Directory Alias (CDA) command.
