The addAccount method in
src/com/android/settings/accounts/AddAccountSettings.java in the
Settings application in Android before 5.0.0 does not properly create
a PendingIntent, which allows attackers to use the SYSTEM uid for
broadcasting an intent with arbitrary component, action, or category
information via a third-party authenticator in a crafted application,
aka Bug 17356824.
