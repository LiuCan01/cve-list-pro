The Monitoring Administration pages in PNMsoft Sequence Kinetics
before 7.7 do not properly detect recursion during entity expansion,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of
nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
