GNOME Shell 3.14.x before 3.14.1, when the Screen Lock feature is
used, does not limit the aggregate memory consumption of all active
PrtSc requests, which allows physically proximate attackers to execute
arbitrary commands on an unattended workstation by making many PrtSc
requests and leveraging a temporary lock outage, and the resulting
temporary shell availability, caused by the Linux kernel OOM killer.
