The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.3 allows
remote authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a
denial of service (resource consumption) by putting the VM into the
rescue state, suspending it, which puts into an ERROR state, and then
deleting the image.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2573.
