plugins/mod_compression.lua in (1) Prosody before 0.9.4 and (2)
Lightwitch Metronome through 3.4 negotiates stream compression while a
session is unauthenticated, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (resource consumption) via compressed XML elements
in an XMPP stream, aka an "xmppbomb" attack.
