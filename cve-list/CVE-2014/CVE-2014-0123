The wiki subsystem in Moodle through 2.3.11, 2.4.x before 2.4.9, 2.5.x
before 2.5.5, and 2.6.x before 2.6.2 does not properly restrict (1)
view and (2) edit access, which allows remote authenticated users to
perform wiki operations by leveraging the student role and using the
Recent Activity block to reach the individual wiki of an arbitrary
student.
