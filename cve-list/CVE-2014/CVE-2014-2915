Xen 4.4.x, when running on ARM systems, does not properly restrict
access to hardware features, which allows local guest users to cause a
denial of service (host or guest crash) via unspecified vectors,
related to (1) cache control, (2) coprocessors, (3) debug registers,
and (4) other unspecified registers.
