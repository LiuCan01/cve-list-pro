The do_mmu_update function in arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.x through 4.4.x
does not properly restrict updates to only PV page tables, which
allows remote PV guests to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference) by leveraging hardware emulation services for HVM guests
using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP).
