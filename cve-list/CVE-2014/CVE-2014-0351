The FortiManager protocol service in Fortinet FortiOS before 4.3.16
and 5.x before 5.0.8 on FortiGate devices does not prevent use of
anonymous ciphersuites, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle
attackers to obtain sensitive information or interfere with
communications by modifying the client-server data stream.
