The Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter in Spring MVC in Spring
Framework before 3.2.8 and 4.0.0 before 4.0.2 does not disable
external entity resolution, which allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks
via crafted XML, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-4152,
CVE-2013-7315, and CVE-2013-6429.
