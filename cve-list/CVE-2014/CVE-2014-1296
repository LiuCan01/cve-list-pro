CFNetwork in Apple iOS before 7.1.1, Apple OS X through 10.9.2, and
Apple TV before 6.1.1 does not ensure that a Set-Cookie HTTP header is
complete before interpreting the header's value, which allows remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by triggering the
closing of a TCP connection during transmission of a header, as
demonstrated by an HTTPOnly restriction.
