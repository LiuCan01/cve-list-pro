The default configuration in Elasticsearch before 1.2 enables dynamic
scripting, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary MVEL
expressions and Java code via the source parameter to _search.  NOTE:
this only violates the vendor's intended security policy if the user
does not run Elasticsearch in its own independent virtual machine.
