Zenoss Core through 5 Beta 3 does not properly detect recursion during
entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document
containing a large number of nested entity references, aka ZEN-15414,
a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
