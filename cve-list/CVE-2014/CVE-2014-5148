Xen 4.4.x, when running on an ARM system and "handling an unknown
system register access from 64-bit userspace," returns to an
instruction of the trap handler for kernel space faults instead of an
instruction that is associated with faults in 64-bit userspace, which
allows local guest users to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly gain privileges via a crafted process.
