snap in powerpc-utils 1.2.20 produces an archive with fstab and
yaboot.conf files potentially containing cleartext passwords, and
lacks a warning about reviewing this archive to detect included
passwords, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by leveraging access to a technical-support data stream.
