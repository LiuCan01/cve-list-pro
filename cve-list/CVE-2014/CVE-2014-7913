The print_option function in dhcp-common.c in dhcpcd through 6.9.1, as
used in dhcp.c in dhcpcd 5.x in Android before 5.1 and other products,
misinterprets the return value of the snprintf function, which allows
remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) via a crafted message.
