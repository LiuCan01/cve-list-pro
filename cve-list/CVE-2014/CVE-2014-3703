OpenStack PackStack 2012.2.1, when the Open vSwitch (OVS) monolithic
plug-in is not used, does not properly set the libvirt_vif_driver
configuration option when generating the nova.conf configuration,
which causes the firewall to be disabled and allows remote attackers
to bypass intended access restrictions.
