Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in XCloner
Standalone 3.5 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change the
administrator password via the config task to index2.php or (2) when
the enable_db_backup and sql_mem options are enabled, access the
database backup functionality via the dbbackup_comp parameter in the
generate action to index2.php.  NOTE: vector 2 might be a duplicate of
CVE-2014-2340, which is for the XCloner Wordpress plugin.  NOTE:
remote attackers can leverage CVE-2014-2996 with vector 2 to execute
arbitrary commands.
