When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication from Spring Security
3.1 to 3.2.4 a malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service
into authenticating a proxy ticket that was not associated. This is
due to the fact that the proxy ticket authentication uses the
information from the HttpServletRequest which is populated based upon
untrusted information within the HTTP request. This means if there are
access control restrictions on which CAS services can authenticate to
one another, those restrictions can be bypassed. If users are not
using CAS Proxy tickets and not basing access control decisions based
upon the CAS Service, then there is no impact to users.
