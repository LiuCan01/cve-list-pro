The passwordCheck function in SAP Router 721 patch 117, 720 patch 411,
710 patch 029, and earlier terminates validation of a Route Permission
Table entry password upon encountering the first incorrect character,
which allows remote attackers to obtrain passwords via a brute-force
attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect
password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.
