The client in Mumble 1.2.x before 1.2.6 allows remote attackers to
force the loading of an external file and cause a denial of service
(hang and resource consumption) via a crafted string that is treated
as rich-text by a Qt widget, as demonstrated by the (1) user or (2)
channel name in a Qt dialog, (3) subject common name or (4) email
address to the Certificate Wizard, or (5) server name in a tooltip.
