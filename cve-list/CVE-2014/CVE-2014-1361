Secure Transport in Apple iOS before 7.1.2, Apple OS X before 10.9.4,
and Apple TV before 6.1.2 does not ensure that a DTLS message is
accepted only for a DTLS connection, which allows remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information from uninitialized process
memory by providing a DTLS message within a TLS connection.
