pcre_jit_compile.c in PCRE 8.35 does not properly use table jumps to
optimize nested alternatives, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (stack memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated by
packets encountered by Suricata during use of a regular expression in
an Emerging Threats Open ruleset.
