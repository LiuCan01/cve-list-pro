** DISPUTED ** GLib 2.31.8 and earlier, when the g_str_hash function
is used, computes hash values without restricting the ability to
trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted
input to an application that maintains a hash table.  NOTE: this issue
may be disputed by the vendor; the existence of the g_str_hash
function is not a vulnerability in the library, because callers of
g_hash_table_new and g_hash_table_new_full can specify an arbitrary
hash function that is appropriate for the application.
