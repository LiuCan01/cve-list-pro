The TAR file parser in Antiy Labs AVL SDK 2.0.3.7, Quick Heal (aka Cat
QuickHeal) 11.00, Jiangmin Antivirus 13.0.900, Norman Antivirus
6.06.12, PC Tools AntiVirus 7.0.3.5, and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0
allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR
file with a 19040010 character sequence at a certain location.
NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional
information is published showing that the error occurred independently
in different TAR parser implementations.
