The sudoers file in the Linux system configuration in F5 FirePass
6.0.0 through 6.1.0 and 7.0.0 does not require a password for
executing commands as root, which allows local users to gain
privileges via the sudo program, as demonstrated by the user account
that executes PHP scripts, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2012-1777.
