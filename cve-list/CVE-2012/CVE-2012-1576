The myuser_delete function in libathemecore/account.c in Atheme 5.x
before 5.2.7, 6.x before 6.0.10, and 7.x before 7.0.0-beta2 does not
properly clean up CertFP entries when a user is deleted, which allows
remote attackers to access a different user account or cause a denial
of service (daemon crash) via a login as a deleted user.
