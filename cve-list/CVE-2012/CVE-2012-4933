The rtrlet web application in the Web Console in Novell ZENworks Asset
Management (ZAM) 7.5 uses a hard-coded username of Ivanhoe and a
hard-coded password of Scott for the (1) GetFile_Password and (2)
GetConfigInfo_Password operations, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via a crafted rtrlet/rtr request for the
HandleMaintenanceCalls function.
