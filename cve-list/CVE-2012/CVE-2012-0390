The DTLS implementation in GnuTLS 3.0.10 and earlier executes certain
error-handling code only if there is a specific relationship between a
padding length and the ciphertext size, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to recover partial plaintext via a timing
side-channel attack, a related issue to CVE-2011-4108.
