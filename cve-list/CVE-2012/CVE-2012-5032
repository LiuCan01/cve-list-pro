The Flex-VPN load-balancing feature in the ipsec-ikev2 implementation
in Cisco IOS before 15.1(1)SY3 does not require authentication, which
allows remote attackers to trigger the forwarding of VPN traffic to an
attacker-controlled destination, or the discarding of this traffic, by
arranging for an arbitrary device to become a cluster member, aka Bug
ID CSCub93641.
