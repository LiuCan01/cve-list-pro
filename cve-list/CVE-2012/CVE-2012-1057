Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the clickthrough
tracking functionality in the Forward module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.21
and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.3 for Drupal allows remote attackers to
hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that increase
node rankings via the tracking code, possibly related to improper
"flood control."
