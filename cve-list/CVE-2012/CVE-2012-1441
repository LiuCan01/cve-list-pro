Reference: MISC:http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/program.html

The Microsoft EXE file parser in eSafe 7.0.17.0 and Prevx 3.0 allows
remote attackers to bypass malware detection via an EXE file with a
modified value in any of several e_ fields.  NOTE: this may later be
SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published
showing that the error occurred independently in different EXE parser
implementations.
