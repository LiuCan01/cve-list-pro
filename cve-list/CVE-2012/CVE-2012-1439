The ELF file parser in eSafe 7.0.17.0, Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03,
Fortinet Antivirus 4.2.254.0, and Panda Antivirus 10.0.2.7 allows
remote attackers to bypass malware detection via an ELF file with a
modified padding field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple
CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error
occurred independently in different ELF parser implementations.
