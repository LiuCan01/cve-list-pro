Rubinius computes hash values without properly restricting the ability
to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted
input to an application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated
by a universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash3
algorithm.
