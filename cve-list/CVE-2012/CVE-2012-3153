Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Reports Developer component in
Oracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.4, 11.1.1.6, and 11.1.2.0 allows
remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown
vectors related to Servlet.  NOTE: the previous information is from
the October 2012 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from the
original researcher that the PARSEQUERY function allows remote
attackers to obtain database credentials via
reports/rwservlet/parsequery, and that this issue occurs in earlier
versions.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2012-3152 to execute
arbitrary code by uploading a .jsp file.
