The STARTTLS implementation in nnrpd in INN before 2.5.3 does not
properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to insert commands into encrypted sessions by sending a
cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to
a "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar issue to
CVE-2011-0411.
