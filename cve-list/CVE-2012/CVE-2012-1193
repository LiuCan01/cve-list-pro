The resolver in PowerDNS Recursor (aka pdns_recursor) 3.3 overwrites
cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing
of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to
trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost
domain names" attack.
