Multiple integer overflows in Opera 11.60 and earlier allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a large
integer argument to the (1) Int32Array, (2) Float32Array, (3)
Float64Array, (4) Uint32Array, (5) Int16Array, or (6) ArrayBuffer
function.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly characterizes this as "a
stability issue, not a security issue."
