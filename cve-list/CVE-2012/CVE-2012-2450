VMware Workstation 8.x before 8.0.3, VMware Player 4.x before 4.0.3,
VMware Fusion 4.x before 4.1.2, VMware ESXi 3.5 through 5.0, and
VMware ESX 3.5 through 4.1 do not properly register SCSI devices,
which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (invalid
write operation and VMX process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code on the host OS by leveraging administrative privileges on the
guest OS.
