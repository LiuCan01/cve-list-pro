Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in upload.php in the Drag &
Drop Gallery module 6.x-1.5 and earlier for Drupal allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a file with an
executable extension followed by a safe extension, then accessing it
via a direct request to the directory specified by the filedir
parameter.
