The nsWindow implementation in the browser engine in Mozilla Firefox
before 3.6.28 and 4.x through 10.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.3,
Thunderbird before 3.1.20 and 5.0 through 10.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x
before 10.0.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.8 does not check the validity of
an instance after event dispatching, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors, as demonstrated
by Mobile Firefox on Android.
