Reference: CISCO:20120620 Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120620-ac

The HostScan downloader implementation in Cisco AnyConnect Secure
Mobility Client 3.x before 3.0 MR8 and Cisco Secure Desktop before
3.6.6020 does not compare the timestamp of offered software to the
timestamp of installed software, which allows remote attackers to
force a version downgrade by using (1) ActiveX or (2) Java components
to offer signed code that corresponds to an older software release,
aka Bug ID CSCtx74235.
