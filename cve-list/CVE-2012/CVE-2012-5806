The PayPal Payments Pro module in Zen Cart does not verify that the
server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate, related to use of the PHP fsockopen function,
a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-5805.
