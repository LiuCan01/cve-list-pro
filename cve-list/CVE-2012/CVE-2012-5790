PayPal Payments Standard PHP Library 20120427 does not verify that the
server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate, related to misinterpretation of a certain TRUE
value.
