The Innominate mGuard Smart HW before HW-101130 and BD before
BD-101030, mGuard industrial RS, mGuard delta HW before HW-103060 and
BD before BD-211010, mGuard PCI, mGuard blade, and EAGLE mGuard
appliances with software before 7.5.0 do not use a sufficient source
of entropy for private keys, which makes it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof (1) HTTPS or (2) SSH servers by
predicting a key value.
