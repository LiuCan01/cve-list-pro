The Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting (AntiXSS) Library 3.x and 4.0
does not properly evaluate characters after the detection of a
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) escaped character, which allows remote
attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via HTML
input, aka "AntiXSS Library Bypass Vulnerability."
