The squidclamav_check_preview_handler function in squidclamav.c in
SquidClamav 5.x before 5.8 and 6.x before 6.7 passes an unescaped URL
to a system command call, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) via a URL with certain characters, as
demonstrated using %0D or %0A.
