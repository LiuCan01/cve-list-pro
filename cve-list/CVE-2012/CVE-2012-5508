The error pages in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1 allow
remote attackers to obtain random numbers and derive the PRNG state
for password resets via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this identifier was
SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. CVE-2012-6661 was
assigned for the PRNG reseeding issue in Zope.
