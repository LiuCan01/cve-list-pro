Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 9.0, Thunderbird 5.0 through 9.0, and
SeaMonkey before 2.7 do not properly initialize data for
image/vnd.microsoft.icon images, which allows remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information by reading a PNG image that
was created through conversion from an ICO image.
