The Quantum Scalar i500 tape library with firmware before i7.0.3
(604G.GS00100), also distributed as the Dell ML6000 tape library with
firmware before A20-00 (590G.GS00100) and the IBM TS3310 tape library
with firmware before R6C (606G.GS001), uses default passwords for
unspecified user accounts, which makes it easier for remote attackers
to obtain access via unknown vectors.
