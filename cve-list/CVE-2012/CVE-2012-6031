The do_tmem_get function in the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) in Xen 4.0,
4.1, and 4.2 allow local guest OS users to cause a denial of service
(CPU hang and host crash) via unspecified vectors related to a
spinlock being held in the "bad_copy error path." NOTE: this issue was
originally published as part of CVE-2012-3497, which was too general;
CVE-2012-3497 has been SPLIT into this ID and others.
