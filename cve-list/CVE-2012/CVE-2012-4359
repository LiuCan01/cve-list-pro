Sielco Sistemi Winlog Pro SCADA before 2.07.18 and Winlog Lite SCADA
before 2.07.18 do not validate the return value of the realloc
function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(invalid 0x00 write operation and daemon crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a port-46824 TCP packet with a crafted
negative integer after the opcode.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4358.
