The PDORow implementation in PHP before 5.3.9 does not properly
interact with the session feature, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted
application that uses a PDO driver for a fetch and then calls the
session_start function, as demonstrated by a crash of the Apache HTTP
Server.
