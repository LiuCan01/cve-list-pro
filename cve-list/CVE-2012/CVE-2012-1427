The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Norman
Antivirus 6.06.12, and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0 allows remote
attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with a
57696E5A6970 character sequence at a certain location.  NOTE:
this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information
is published showing that the error occurred independently in
different TAR parser implementations.
