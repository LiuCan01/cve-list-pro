** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
functionality in Ruby 1.9.3-p194, when installed in the top-level C:directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan
horse DLL in the C:Ruby193bin directory, which may be added to the
PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated
by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec
Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server
2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE
disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established only by a
separate administrative action that is not a default part of the Ruby
installation.
