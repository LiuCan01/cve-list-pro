The PRNG implementation in the DNS resolver in Bionic in Android
before 4.1.1 incorrectly uses time and PID information during the
generation of random numbers for query ID values and UDP source ports,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses by
guessing these numbers, a related issue to CVE-2015-0800.
