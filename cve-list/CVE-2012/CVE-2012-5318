Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in
uploadify/scripts/uploadify.php in the Kish Guest Posting plugin 1.2
for WordPress allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
uploading a file with a double extension, then accessing it via a
direct request to the file in the directory specified by the folder
parameter.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
fix for CVE-2012-1125.
