jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors
from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery
determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character
anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when
attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery
only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<'
character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control
the beginning of a string, which is far less common.
