The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation in Microsoft Windows
XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows
Server 2008 SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not
properly process packets in memory, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code by sending crafted RDP packets triggering
access to an object that (1) was not properly initialized or (2) is
deleted, aka "Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2012-0002.
