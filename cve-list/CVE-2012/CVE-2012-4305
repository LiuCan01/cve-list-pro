Unspecified vulnerability in the JavaFX component in Oracle Java SE
JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors, a
different vulnerability than other CVEs listed in the February 2013
CPU.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU.
Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related
to an "invalid type cast" and exposed native methods in the T2KGlyph
class.
