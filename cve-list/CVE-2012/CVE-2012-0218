Xen 3.4, 4.0, and 4.1, when the guest OS has not registered a handler
for a syscall or sysenter instruction, does not properly clear a flag
for exception injection when injecting a General Protection Fault,
which allows local PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service
(guest crash) by later triggering an exception that would normally be
handled within Xen.
