The Zoner AntiVirus Free application for Android does not verify that
the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate, as
demonstrated by a server used for updating virus signature files.
