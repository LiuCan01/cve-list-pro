html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp in WebCore in WebKit, as used in Google
Chrome through 22 and Safari 5.1.7, does not consider all possible
output contexts of reflected data, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to bypass a cross-site scripting (XSS) protection mechanism
via a crafted string, aka rdar problem 12019108.
