lib/modinfolib.php in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.10, 2.1.x before 2.1.7,
2.2.x before 2.2.4, and 2.3.x before 2.3.1 does not check for a
group-membership requirement when determining whether an activity is
unavailable or hidden, which allows remote authenticated users to
bypass intended access restrictions by selecting an activity that is
configured for a group of other users.
