The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) functionality in Microsoft .NET
Framework 2.0 SP2, 3.5, 3.5.1, 4, and 4.5 does not validate
configuration data that is returned during acquisition of proxy
settings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
JavaScript code by providing crafted data during execution of (1) an
XAML browser application (aka XBAP) or (2) a .NET Framework
application, aka "Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Vulnerability."
