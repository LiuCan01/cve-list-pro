Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/77483

Heap-based buffer overflow in the read function in
filters/words/msword-odf/wv2/src/styles.cpp in the Microsoft import
filter in KOffice 2.3.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a crafted ODF style in an ODF document.  NOTE: this is the
same vulnerability as CVE-2012-3456, but it was SPLIT by the CNA even
though Calligra and KOffice share the same codebase.
