Reference: BUGTRAQ:20120319 Evasion attacks expoliting file-parsing vulnerabilities in antivirus products
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/522005
Reference: MISC:http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2012/program.html

The Microsoft Office file parser in Comodo Antivirus 7425 and Sophos
Anti-Virus 4.61.0 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection
via an Office file with a ustar character sequence at a certain
location.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if
additional information is published showing that the error occurred
independently in different Office parser implementations.
