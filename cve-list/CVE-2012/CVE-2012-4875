** DISPUTED **

Heap-based buffer overflow in gdevwpr2.c in Ghostscript 9.04, when
processing the OutputFile device parameter, allows user-assisted
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long file name in a
PostScript document.  NOTE: as of 20120314, the developer was not able
to reproduce the issue and disputed it.
