The proc_deutf function in includes/functions_vbseocp_abstract.php in
vBSEO 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.6.0, and earlier allows remote attackers
to insert and execute arbitrary PHP code via "complex curly syntax" in
the char_repl parameter, which is inserted into a regular expression
that is processed by the preg_replace function with the eval switch.
