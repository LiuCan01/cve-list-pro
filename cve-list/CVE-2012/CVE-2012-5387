Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in wlcms-plugin.php in
the White Label CMS plugin before 1.5.1 for WordPress allows remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests
that modify the developer name via the wlcms_o_developer_name
parameter in a save action to wp-admin/admin.php, as demonstrated by a
developer name containing XSS sequences.
