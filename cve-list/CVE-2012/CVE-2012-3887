AirDroid before 1.0.7 beta uses a cleartext base64 format for data
transfer that is documented as an "Encrypted Transmission" feature,
which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by
sniffing the local wireless network, as demonstrated by the SMS
message content sent to the sdctl/sms/send/single/ URI.
