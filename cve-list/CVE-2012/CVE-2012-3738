The Emergency Dialer screen in the Passcode Lock implementation in
Apple iOS before 6 does not properly limit the dialing methods, which
allows physically proximate attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and make FaceTime calls through Voice Dialing, or obtain
sensitive contact information by attempting to make a FaceTime call
and reading the contact suggestions.
