The DTLS support in radsecproxy before 1.6.2 does not properly verify
certificates when there are configuration blocks with CA settings that
are unrelated to the block being used for verifying the certificate
chain, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and spoof clients, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2012-4523.
