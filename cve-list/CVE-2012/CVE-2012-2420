The intu-help-qb (aka Intuit Help System Async Pluggable Protocol)
handlers in HelpAsyncPluggableProtocol.dll in Intuit QuickBooks 2009
through 2012, when Internet Explorer is used, might allow remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information via a URI with a % (percent)
character as its (1) last or (2) second-to-last character, in
situations where a certain "post-URL data" buffer contains a 0x0000
character but a buffer overflow does not occur.
