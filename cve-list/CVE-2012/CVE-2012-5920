Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Web Toolkit (GWT)
2.4 through 2.5 Final, as used in JBoss Operations Network (ON) 3.1.1
and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this
issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4563.
