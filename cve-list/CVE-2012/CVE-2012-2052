Stack-based buffer overflow in the U3D.8BI library plugin in Adobe
Photoshop CS5 12.x before 12.0.5 and CS5.1 12.1.x before 12.1.1 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long Collada asset
element in a DAE file, as demonstrated by the cameraYFov value in the
contributor comments element.
