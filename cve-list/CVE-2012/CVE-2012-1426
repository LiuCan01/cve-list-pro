The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Command
Antivirus 5.2.11.5, F-Prot Antivirus 4.6.2.117, K7 AntiVirus
9.77.3565, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03
allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR
file with an initial 425A68 character sequence.  NOTE: this may
later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is
published showing that the error occurred independently in different
TAR parser implementations.
