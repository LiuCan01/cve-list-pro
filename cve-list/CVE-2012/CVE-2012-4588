McAfee Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) Agent before 4.8 and Server
before 10.1 record all invalid usernames presented in failed login
attempts, and place them on a list of accounts that an administrator
may wish to unlock, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (excessive list size in the EMM Database) via a long sequence
of login attempts with different usernames.
