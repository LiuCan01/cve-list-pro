The default configuration for IPA servers in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6, when revoking a certificate from an Identity Management replica,
does not properly update another Identity Management replica, which
causes inconsistent Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to be used and
might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
via a revoked certificate.
