Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
osCommerce/OM/Core/Site/Setup/Application/Install/RPC/DBCheck.php in
OSCommerce Online Merchant 3.0.2, when the software is being
installed, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the name parameter to oscommerce/index.php, which is not
properly handled in an error message.  NOTE: this might not be a
vulnerability, since the ability to access oscommerce/index.php during
installation may already imply administrator privileges.
