McAfee Email and Web Security (EWS) 5.x before 5.5 Patch 6 and 5.6
before Patch 3, and McAfee Email Gateway (MEG) 7.0 before Patch 1,
does not disable the server-side session token upon the closing of the
Management Console/Dashboard, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to hijack sessions by capturing a session cookie and then
modifying the response to a login attempt, related to a "Logout
Failure" issue.
