RuggedCom Rugged Operating System (ROS) before 3.3 has a factory
account with a password derived from the MAC Address field in a
banner, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by
performing a calculation on this address value, and then establishing
a (1) SSH or (2) HTTPS session, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2012-1803.
