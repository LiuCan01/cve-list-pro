Multiple integer overflows in the (1) chk_malloc, (2) leak_malloc, and
(3) leak_memalign functions in libc/bionic/malloc_debug_leak.c in
Bionic (libc) for Android, when libc.debug.malloc is set, make it
easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related
attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes
less memory to be allocated than expected.
