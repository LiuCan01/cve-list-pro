Reference: URL:http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-1443-2

The Apport hook (DistUpgradeApport.py) in Update Manager, as used by
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 11.10, and 11.04, uploads the /var/log/dist-upgrade
directory when reporting bugs to Launchpad, which allows remote
attackers to read repository credentials by viewing a public bug
report.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix
for CVE-2012-0949.
