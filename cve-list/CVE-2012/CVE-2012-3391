mod/forum/rsslib.php in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before
2.2.4 does not properly implement the requirement for posting before
reading a Q&A forum, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass
intended access restrictions by leveraging the student role and
reading the RSS feed for a forum.
