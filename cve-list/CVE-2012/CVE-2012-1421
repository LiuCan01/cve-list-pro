The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Norman
Antivirus 6.06.12, Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03, and AVEngine
20101.3.0.103 in Symantec Endpoint Protection 11 allows remote
attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with an
initial MSCF character sequence.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into
multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the
error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.
