libsecurity in Apple Mac OS X before 10.7.4 does not properly restrict
the length of RSA keys within X.509 certificates, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection
mechanisms by conducting a spoofing or network-sniffing attack during
communication with a site that uses a short key.
