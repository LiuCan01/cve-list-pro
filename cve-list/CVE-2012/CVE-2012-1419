The TAR file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Quick Heal (aka Cat
QuickHeal) 11.00 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection
via a POSIX TAR file with an initial [aliases] character sequence.
NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional
information is published showing that the error occurred independently
in different TAR parser implementations.
