Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Wolf CMS
0.75 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication
of administrators for requests that (1) delete users via the user id
number to admin/user/delete; (2) delete pages via the page id number
to admin/page/delete; delete the (3) images or (4) themes directory
via the directory name to admin/plugin/file_manager/delete, and
possibly other directories; or (5) logout the user via a request to
admin/login/logout.
