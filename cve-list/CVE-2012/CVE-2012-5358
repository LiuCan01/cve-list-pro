Reference: CONFIRM:http://documentation.ektron.com/current/ReleaseNotes/Release8/8.02SP5.htm

The XSLTCompiledTransform function in Ektron Content Management System
(CMS) before 8.02 SP5 configures the XSL with enableDocumentFunction
set to true, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files and
consequently bypass authentication, modify viewstate, cause a denial
of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted XSL
data.
