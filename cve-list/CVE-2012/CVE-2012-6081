Multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in the (1) twikidraw
(action/twikidraw.py) and (2) anywikidraw (action/anywikidraw.py)
actions in MoinMoin before 1.9.6 allow remote authenticated users with
write permissions to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with
an executable extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the
file in an unspecified directory, as exploited in the wild in July
2012.
