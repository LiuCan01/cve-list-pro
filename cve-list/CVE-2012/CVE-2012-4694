Moxa EDR-G903 series routers with firmware before 2.11 do not use a
sufficient source of entropy for (1) SSH and (2) SSL keys, which makes
it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a device or modify
a client-server data stream by leveraging knowledge of a key from a
product installation elsewhere.
