OpenTTD 0.6.0 through 1.2.1 does not properly validate requests to
clear a water tile, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and server crash) via a certain
sequence of steps related to "the water/coast aspect of tiles which
also have railtracks on one half."
