** DISPUTED ** The wp_create_nonce function in
wp-includes/pluggable.php in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier associates a
nonce with a user account instead of a user session, which might make
it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) attacks on specific actions and objects by sniffing the
network, as demonstrated by attacks against the
wp-admin/admin-ajax.php and wp-admin/user-new.php scripts.  NOTE: the
vendor reportedly disputes the significance of this issue because
wp_create_nonce operates as intended, even if it is arguably
inconsistent with certain CSRF protection details advocated by
external organizations.
