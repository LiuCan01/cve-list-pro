The Bitcoin protocol, as used in bitcoind before 0.4.4, wxBitcoin,
Bitcoin-Qt, and other programs, does not properly handle multiple
transactions with the same identifier, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (unspendable transaction) by leveraging
the ability to create a duplicate coinbase transaction.
