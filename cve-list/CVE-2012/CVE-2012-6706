A VMSF_DELTA memory corruption was discovered in unrar before 5.5.5, as
used in Sophos Anti-Virus Threat Detection Engine before 3.37.2 and
other products, that can lead to arbitrary code execution. An integer
overflow can be caused in DataSize+CurChannel. The result is a negative
value of the "DestPos" variable, which allows the attacker to write out
of bounds when setting Mem[DestPos].
