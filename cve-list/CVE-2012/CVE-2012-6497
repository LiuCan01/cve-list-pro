The Authlogic gem for Ruby on Rails, when used with certain versions
before 3.2.10, makes potentially unsafe find_by_id method calls, which
might allow remote attackers to conduct CVE-2012-6496 SQL injection
attacks via a crafted parameter in environments that have a known
secret_token value, as demonstrated by a value contained in
secret_token.rb in an open-source product.
