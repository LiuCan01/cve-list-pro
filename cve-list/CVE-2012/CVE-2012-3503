The installation script in Katello 1.0 and earlier does not properly
generate the Application.config.secret_token value, which causes each
default installation to have the same secret token, and allows remote
attackers to authenticate to the CloudForms System Engine web
interface as an arbitrary user by creating a cookie using the default
secret_token.
