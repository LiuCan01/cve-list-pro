sql/password.c in Oracle MySQL 5.1.x before 5.1.63, 5.5.x before
5.5.24, and 5.6.x before 5.6.6, and MariaDB 5.1.x before 5.1.62, 5.2.x
before 5.2.12, 5.3.x before 5.3.6, and 5.5.x before 5.5.23, when
running in certain environments with certain implementations of the
memcmp function, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by
repeatedly authenticating with the same incorrect password, which
eventually causes a token comparison to succeed due to an
improperly-checked return value.
