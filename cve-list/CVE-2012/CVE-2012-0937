** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component
in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier does not limit the number of MySQL
queries sent to external MySQL database servers, which allows remote
attackers to use WordPress as a proxy for brute-force attacks or
denial of service attacks via the dbhost parameter, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-4898.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the
significance of this issue because an incomplete WordPress
installation might be present on the network for only a short time.
