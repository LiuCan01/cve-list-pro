AutoFORM PDM Archive before 7.0 implements user accounts in a way that
allows for JMX Console authentication, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via the
/jmx-console URI, and then upload and execute arbitrary JSP code via a
JBoss remote-deployment mechanism, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2012-1828.
