The serializing/deserializing functions in the qpid::framing::Buffer
class in Apache Qpid 0.20 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue could also trigger an
out-of-bounds read, but it might not trigger a crash.
