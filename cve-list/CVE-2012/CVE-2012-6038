admin/core/admin_func.php in razorCMS before 1.2.1 does not properly
restrict access to certain administrator directories and files, which
allows remote authenticated users to read, edit, rename, move, copy
and delete files via the (1) dir parameter in a fileman or (2)
filemanview action.  NOTE: this issue has been referred to as a "path
traversal."
