** DISPUTED ** submitticket.php in WHMCompleteSolution (WHMCS) 5.03
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code into a subject field
via crafted ticket data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5061.
NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, noting that some of the details
overlap CVE-2011-5061, but that it "says it affects V5.0.3, and the
submitticket.php file, both of which are wrong."
