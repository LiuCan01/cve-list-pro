The kernel in Samsung Galaxy S2, Galaxy Note 2, MEIZU MX, and possibly
other Android devices, when running an Exynos 4210 or 4412 processor,
uses weak permissions (0666) for /dev/exynos-mem, which allows
attackers to read or write arbitrary physical memory and gain
privileges via a crafted application, as demonstrated by ExynosAbuse.
