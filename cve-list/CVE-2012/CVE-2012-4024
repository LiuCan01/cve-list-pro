Stack-based buffer overflow in the get_component function in
unsquashfs.c in unsquashfs in Squashfs 4.2 and earlier allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted list file (aka a
crafted file for the -ef option).  NOTE: probably in most cases, the
list file is a trusted file constructed by the program's user;
however, there are some realistic situations in which a list file
would be obtained from an untrusted remote source.
