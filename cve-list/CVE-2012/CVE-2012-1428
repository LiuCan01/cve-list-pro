The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Norman
Antivirus 6.06.12, and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0 allows remote
attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with a
4a464946 character sequence at a certain location.  NOTE: this may
later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is
published showing that the error occurred independently in different
TAR parser implementations.
