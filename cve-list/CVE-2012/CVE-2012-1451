The CAB file parser in Emsisoft Anti-Malware 5.1.0.1 and Ikarus Virus
Utilities T3 Command Line Scanner 1.1.97.0 allows remote attackers to
bypass malware detection via a CAB file with a modified reserved2
field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional
information is published showing that the error occurred independently
in different CAB parser implementations.
