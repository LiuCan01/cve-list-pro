** DISPUTED ** Squid 3.1.9 allows remote attackers to bypass the
access configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary
allowed hostname in the Host HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue might not
be reproducible, because the researcher is unable to provide a
squid.conf file for a vulnerable system, and the observed behavior is
consistent with a squid.conf file that was (perhaps inadvertently)
designed to allow access based on a "req_header Host" acl regex that
matches www.uol.com.br.
