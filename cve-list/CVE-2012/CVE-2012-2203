IBM Global Security Kit (aka GSKit) before 8.0.14.22, as used in IBM
Rational Directory Server, IBM Tivoli Directory Server, and other
products, uses the PKCS #12 file format for certificate objects
without enforcing file integrity, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to spoof SSL servers via vectors involving insertion of an
arbitrary root Certification Authority (CA) certificate.
