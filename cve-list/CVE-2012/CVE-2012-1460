The Gzip file parser in Antiy Labs AVL SDK 2.0.3.7, Quick Heal (aka
Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Command Antivirus 5.2.11.5, eSafe 7.0.17.0,
F-Prot Antivirus 4.6.2.117, Jiangmin Antivirus 13.0.900, K7 AntiVirus
9.77.3565, and VBA32 3.12.14.2 allows remote attackers to bypass
malware detection via a .tar.gz file with stray bytes at the end.
NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional
information is published showing that the error occurred independently
in different Gzip parser implementations.
