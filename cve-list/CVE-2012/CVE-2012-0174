Windows Firewall in tcpip.sys in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows
Server 2008 SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not
properly enforce firewall rules for outbound broadcast packets, which
allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by
observing broadcast traffic on a local network, aka "Windows Firewall
Bypass Vulnerability."
