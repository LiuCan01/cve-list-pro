Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) 5.x before 5.2 Patch 11 and
5.3 before 5.3 Patch 7, when a certain configuration involving TACACS+
and LDAP is used, does not properly validate passwords, which allows
remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending a valid username
and a crafted password string, aka Bug ID CSCuc65634.
