The clone_file function in transfer.c in Augeas before 1.0.0, when
copy_if_rename_fails is set and EXDEV or EBUSY is returned by the
rename function, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files and
obtain sensitive information via a bind mount on the (1) .augsave or
(2) destination file when using the backup save option, or (3) .augnew
file when using the newfile save option.
