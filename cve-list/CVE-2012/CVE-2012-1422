The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, NOD32
Antivirus 5795, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Rising Antivirus
22.83.00.03 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a
POSIX TAR file with an initial ITSF character sequence.  NOTE: this may
later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is
published showing that the error occurred independently in different
TAR parser implementations.
