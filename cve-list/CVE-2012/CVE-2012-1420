The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Command
Antivirus 5.2.11.5, F-Prot Antivirus 4.6.2.117, Fortinet Antivirus
4.2.254.0, K7 AntiVirus 9.77.3565, Kaspersky Anti-Virus 7.0.0.125,
Antimalware Engine 1.1.6402.0 in Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0,
NOD32 Antivirus 5795, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, Panda Antivirus
10.0.2.7, and Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03 allows remote attackers to
bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with an initial 7fELF
character sequence.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs
if additional information is published showing that the error occurred
independently in different TAR parser implementations.
