** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
functionality in Zend Server 5.6.0 SP4, when installed in the
top-level C: directory, might allow local users to gain privileges
via a Trojan horse DLL in the
C:ZendZendServershareZendFrameworkbin directory, which may be
added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as
demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and
AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1,
Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.
NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the choice of C: (and the
resulting unsafe PATH) is established by an administrative action that
is not a default part of the Zend Server installation.
