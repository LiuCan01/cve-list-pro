Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the web
interface in Cerberus FTP Server before 5.0.5.0 allow remote attackers
to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1)
add a user account or (2) reconfigure the state of the FTP service, as
demonstrated by a request to usermanager/users/modify.
