IBM Global Security Kit (aka GSKit) before 8.0.14.22, as used in IBM
Rational Directory Server, IBM Tivoli Directory Server, and other
products, does not properly validate data during execution of a
protection mechanism against the Vaudenay SSL CBC timing attack, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) via crafted values in the TLS Record Layer, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2012-2333.
