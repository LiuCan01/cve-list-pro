AscoServer.exe in the server in Siemens SiPass integrated MP2.6 and
earlier does not properly handle IOCP RPC messages received over an
Ethernet network, which allows remote attackers to write data to any
memory location and consequently execute arbitrary code via crafted
messages, as demonstrated by an arbitrary pointer dereference attack
or a buffer overflow attack.
