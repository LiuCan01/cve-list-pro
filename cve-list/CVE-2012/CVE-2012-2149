The WPXContentListener::_closeTableRow function in
WPXContentListener.cpp in libwpd 0.8.8, as used by OpenOffice.org
(OOo) before 3.4, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a crafted Wordperfect .WPD document that causes a negative array
index to be used.  NOTE: some sources report this issue as an integer
overflow.
