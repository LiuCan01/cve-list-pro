The SSH USERAUTH CHANGE REQUEST feature in SSH Tectia Server 6.0.4
through 6.0.20, 6.1.0 through 6.1.12, 6.2.0 through 6.2.5, and 6.3.0
through 6.3.2 on UNIX and Linux, when old-style password
authentication is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication via a crafted session involving entry of blank
passwords, as demonstrated by a root login session from a modified
OpenSSH client with an added input_userauth_passwd_changereq call in
sshconnect2.c.
