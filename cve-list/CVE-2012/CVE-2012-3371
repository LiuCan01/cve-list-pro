The Nova scheduler in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2) and
Essex (2012.1), when DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter is enabled,
allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
(excessive database lookup calls and server hang) via a request with
many repeated IDs in the os:scheduler_hints section.
