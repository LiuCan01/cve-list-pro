McAfee Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) Agent before 4.8 and Server
before 10.1, when one-time provisioning (OTP) mode is enabled, have an
improper dependency on DNS SRV records, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to discover user passwords by spoofing the EMM
server, as demonstrated by a password entered on an iOS device.
