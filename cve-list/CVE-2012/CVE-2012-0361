The sccp-protocol component in Cisco IP Communicator (CIPC) 7.0
through 8.6 does not limit the rate of SCCP messages to Cisco Unified
Communications Manager (CUCM), which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service via vectors that trigger (1) on hook and (2) off
hook messages, as demonstrated by a Plantronics headset, aka Bug ID
CSCti40315.
