The default configuration of Fortinet Fortigate UTM appliances uses
the same Certification Authority certificate and same private key
across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the
presence of the Fortinet_CA_SSLProxy certificate in a list of trusted
root certification authorities.
