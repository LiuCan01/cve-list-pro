The management web pages on the Sinapsi eSolar Light Photovoltaic
System Monitor (aka Schneider Electric Ezylog photovoltaic SCADA
management server), Sinapsi eSolar, and Sinapsi eSolar DUO with
firmware before 2.0.2870_2.2.12 do not require authentication, which
allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access via a direct
request, as demonstrated by a request to ping.php.
