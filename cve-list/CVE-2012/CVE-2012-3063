Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE) before A4(2.3) and A5 before
A5(1.1), when multicontext mode is enabled, does not properly share a
management IP address among multiple contexts, which allows remote
authenticated administrators to bypass intended access restrictions in
opportunistic circumstances, and read or modify configuration
settings, via a login attempt to a context, aka Bug ID CSCts30631, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2012-3058.
