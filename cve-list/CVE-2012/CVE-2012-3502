The proxy functionality in (1) mod_proxy_ajp.c in the mod_proxy_ajp
module and (2) mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy_http module in the
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.3 does not properly determine the
situations that require closing a back-end connection, which allows
remote attackers to obtain sensitive information in opportunistic
circumstances by reading a response that was intended for a different
client.
