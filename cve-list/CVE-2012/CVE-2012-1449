The CAB file parser in NOD32 Antivirus 5795 and Rising Antivirus
22.83.00.03 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a
CAB file with a modified vMajor field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT
into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that
the error occurred independently in different CAB parser
implementations.
