The GridFTP in Globus Toolkit (GT) before 5.2.2, when certain autoconf
macros are defined, does not properly check the return value from the
getpwnam_r function, which might allow remote attackers to gain
privileges by logging in with a user that does not exist, which causes
GridFTP to run as the last user in the password file.
