VP8 Codec SDK (libvpx) before 1.0.0 "Duclair" allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (application crash) via (1) unspecified
"corrupt input" or (2) by "starting decoding from a P-frame," which
triggers an out-of-bounds read, related to "the clamping of motion
vectors in SPLITMV blocks".
