** DISPUTED ** The default configuration of Cyberoam UTM appliances
uses the same Certification Authority certificate and same private key
across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the
presence of the Cyberoam_SSL_CA certificate in a list of trusted root
certification authorities.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance
of this issue because the appliance "does not allow import or export
of the foresaid private key."
