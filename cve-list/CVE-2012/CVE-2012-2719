The filedepot module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.3 for Drupal, when accessed
using multiple different browsers from the same IP address, causes
Internet Explorer sessions to "switch users" when uploading a file,
which has unspecified impact possibly involving file uploads to the
wrong user directory, aka "Session Management Vulnerability."
