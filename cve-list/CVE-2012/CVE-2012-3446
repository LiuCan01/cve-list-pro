Apache Libcloud before 0.11.1 uses an incorrect regular expression
during verification of whether the server hostname matches a domain
name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the
X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
SSL servers via a crafted certificate.
