The resolver in dnscache in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns 1.05 overwrites
cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing
of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to
trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost
domain names" attack.
