Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=826702

extensions/libxt_tcp.c in iptables through 1.4.21 does not match TCP
SYN+FIN packets in --syn rules, which might allow remote attackers to
bypass intended firewall restrictions via crafted packets.  NOTE: the
CVE-2012-6638 fix makes this issue less relevant.
