RuggedCom Rugged Operating System (ROS) 3.10.x and earlier has a
factory account with a password derived from the MAC Address field in
the banner, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
access by performing a calculation on this address value, and then
establishing a (1) TELNET, (2) remote shell (aka rsh), or (3)
serial-console session.
