The ELF file parser in Dr.Web 5.0.2.03300, eSafe 7.0.17.0, McAfee
Gateway (formerly Webwasher) 2010.1C, Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03,
Fortinet Antivirus 4.2.254.0, and Panda Antivirus 10.0.2.7 allows
remote attackers to bypass malware detection via an ELF file with a
modified ei_version field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple
CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error
occurred independently in different ELF parser implementations.
