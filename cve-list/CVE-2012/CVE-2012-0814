The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH
before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command
options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially
sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by
the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross
privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no
shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to
read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
