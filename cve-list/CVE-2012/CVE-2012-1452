The CAB file parser in Emsisoft Anti-Malware 5.1.0.1, Ikarus Virus
Utilities T3 Command Line Scanner 1.1.97.0, and Quick Heal (aka Cat
QuickHeal) 11.00 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection
via a CAB file with a modified reserved1 field.  NOTE: this may later
be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published
showing that the error occurred independently in different CAB parser
implementations.
