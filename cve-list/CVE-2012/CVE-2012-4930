The SPDY protocol 3 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, and other products, can perform TLS encryption of compressed
data without properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP
headers by observing length differences during a series of guesses in
which a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an unknown
string in an HTTP header, aka a "CRIME" attack.
