functions/imap_general.php in SquirrelMail, as used in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5, does not properly handle 8-bit
characters in passwords, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (disk consumption) by making many IMAP login
attempts with different usernames, leading to the creation of many
preference files.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix
for CVE-2010-2813.
