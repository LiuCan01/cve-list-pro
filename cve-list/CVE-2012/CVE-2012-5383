** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
functionality in Oracle MySQL 5.5.28, when installed in the top-level
C: directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan
horse DLL in the "C:MySQLMySQL Server 5.5bin" directory, which may
be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator,
as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE
and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1,
Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.
NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established
only by a separate administrative action that is not a default part of
the MySQL installation.
