The (1) EC2 and (2) OS APIs in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom
(2012.2), Essex (2012.1), and Diablo (2011.3) do not properly check
the protocol when security groups are created and the network protocol
is not specified entirely in lowercase, which allows remote attackers
to bypass intended access restrictions.
