Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) PHP Library does not verify
that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common
Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which
allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an
arbitrary valid certificate, related to misinterpretation of a certain
"true" value.
