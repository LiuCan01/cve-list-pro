The Microsoft CHM file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Sophos Anti-Virus
4.61.0 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a
crafted reset interval in the LZXC header of a CHM file.  NOTE: this
may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is
published showing that the error occurred independently in different
CHM parser implementations.
