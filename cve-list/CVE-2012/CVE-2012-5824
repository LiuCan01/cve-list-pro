Trillian 5.1.0.19 does not verify that the server hostname matches a
domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field
of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2009-4831.
