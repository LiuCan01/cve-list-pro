The default configuration of the SMTP component in Websense Email
Security 6.1 through 7.3 enables weak SSL ciphers in the "SurfControl
plcSuperScout Email FilterSMTP" registry key, which makes it easier
for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the
network and then conducting a brute-force attack against encrypted
session data.
