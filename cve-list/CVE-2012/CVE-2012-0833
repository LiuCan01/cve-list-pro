The acllas__handle_group_entry function in
servers/plugins/acl/acllas.c in 389 Directory Server before 1.2.10
does not properly handled access control instructions (ACIs) that use
certificate groups, which allows remote authenticated LDAP users with
a certificate group to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and
CPU consumption) by binding to the server.
