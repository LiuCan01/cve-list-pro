libxml2 2.9.0-rc1 and earlier, as used in Google Chrome before
21.0.1180.89, does not properly support a cast of an unspecified
variable during handling of XSL transforms, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unknown other
impact via a crafted document, related to the _xmlNs data structure in
include/libxml/tree.h.
