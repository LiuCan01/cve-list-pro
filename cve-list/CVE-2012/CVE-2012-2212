** DISPUTED ** McAfee Web Gateway 7.0 allows remote attackers to
bypass the access configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an
arbitrary allowed hostname in the Host HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue
might not be reproducible, because the researcher did not provide
configuration details for the vulnerable system, and the observed
behavior might be consistent with a configuration that was (perhaps
inadvertently) designed to allow access based on Host HTTP headers.
