Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before
21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does not request user
confirmation before continuing a large series of downloads, which
allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(resource consumption) via a crafted web site.
