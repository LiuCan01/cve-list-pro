MySQL 5.0.88, and possibly other versions and platforms, allows local
users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a
MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY
arguments that are originally associated with pathnames without
symlinks, and that can point to tables created at a future time at
which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a subdirectory of
the MySQL data home directory, related to incorrect calculation of the
mysql_unpacked_real_data_home value.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
because of a CVE-2009-4030 regression, which was not omitted in other
packages and versions such as MySQL 5.0.95 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6.
