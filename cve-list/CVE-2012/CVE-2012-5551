Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the MailChimp
module 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.7 for Drupal allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related to (1) a
predictable "webhook URL key" and (2) improper sanitization of
"Webhook variables from POST requests."
