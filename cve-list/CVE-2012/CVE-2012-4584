McAfee Email and Web Security (EWS) 5.x before 5.5 Patch 6 and 5.6
before Patch 3, and McAfee Email Gateway (MEG) 7.0 before Patch 1,
does not properly encrypt system-backup data, which makes it easier
for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by
reading a backup file, as demonstrated by obtaining password hashes.
