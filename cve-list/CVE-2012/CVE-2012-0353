The UDP inspection engine on Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA)
5500 series devices, and the ASA Services Module (ASASM) in Cisco
Catalyst 6500 series devices, with software 8.0 before 8.0(5.25), 8.1
before 8.1(2.50), 8.2 before 8.2(5.5), 8.3 before 8.3(2.22), 8.4
before 8.4(2.1), and 8.5 before 8.5(1.2) does not properly handle
flows, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(device reload) via a crafted series of (1) IPv4 or (2) IPv6 UDP
packets, aka Bug ID CSCtq10441.
