Oracle Java SE 7 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7 and earlier, computes hash
values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash
collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an
application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a
universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash3 algorithm, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2012-2739.
