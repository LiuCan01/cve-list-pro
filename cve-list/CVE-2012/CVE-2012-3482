Fetchmail 5.0.8 through 6.3.21, when using NTLM authentication in
debug mode, allows remote NTLM servers to (1) cause a denial of
service (crash and delayed delivery of inbound mail) via a crafted
NTLM response that triggers an out-of-bounds read in the base64
decoder, or (2) obtain sensitive information from memory via an NTLM
Type 2 message with a crafted Target Name structure, which triggers an
out-of-bounds read.
