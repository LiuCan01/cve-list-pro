Reference: CISCO:20120620 Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120620-ac

The VPN downloader implementation in the WebLaunch feature in Cisco
AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 2.x before 2.5 MR6 and 3.x before
3.0 MR8 does not compare the timestamp of offered software to the
timestamp of installed software, which allows remote attackers to
force a version downgrade by using (1) ActiveX or (2) Java components
to offer signed code that corresponds to an older software release,
aka Bug ID CSCtw48681.
