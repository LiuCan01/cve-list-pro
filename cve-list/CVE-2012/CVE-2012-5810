The Chase mobile banking application for Android does not verify that
the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate, related to overriding the default X509TrustManager.
NOTE: this vulnerability was fixed in the summer of 2012, but the
version number was not changed or is not known.
