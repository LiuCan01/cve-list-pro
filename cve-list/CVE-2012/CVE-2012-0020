Microsoft Visio Viewer 2010 Gold and SP1 does not properly handle
memory during the parsing of files, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via crafted attributes in a Visio file, aka
"VSD File Format Memory Corruption Vulnerability," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2012-0019, CVE-2012-0136, CVE-2012-0137, and
CVE-2012-0138.
