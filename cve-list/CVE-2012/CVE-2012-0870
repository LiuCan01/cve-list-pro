Heap-based buffer overflow in process.c in smbd in Samba 3.0, as used
in the file-sharing service on the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet before
2.0.0.7971 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
via a Batched (aka AndX) request that triggers infinite recursion.
