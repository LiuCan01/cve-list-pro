The ELF file parser in Fortinet Antivirus 4.2.254.0, eSafe 7.0.17.0,
Dr.Web 5.0.2.03300, and Panda Antivirus 10.0.2.7 allows remote
attackers to bypass malware detection via an ELF file with a modified
e_version field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if
additional information is published showing that the error occurred
independently in different ELF parser implementations.
