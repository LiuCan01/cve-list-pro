Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Mahara 1.4.x
before 1.4.5 and 1.5.x before 1.5.4, and other versions including 1.2,
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
CSV header with "unknown fields," which are not properly handled in
error messages in the (1) bulk user, (2) group, and (3) group member
upload capabilities.  NOTE: this issue was originally part of
CVE-2012-2243, but that ID was SPLIT due to different issues by
different researchers.
