The webRequest API in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X
and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does
not properly interact with the Chrome Web Store, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted web site.
