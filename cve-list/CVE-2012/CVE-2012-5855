The SHAddToRecentDocs function in VideoLAN VLC media player 2.0.4 and
earlier might allow user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) via a crafted file name that triggers an incorrect
string-length calculation when the file is added to VLC.  NOTE: it is
not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries or whether
it can be exploited without user interaction.
