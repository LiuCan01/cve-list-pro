Stack-based buffer overflow in the DCERPC inspection engine on Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) 5500 series devices, and the ASA
Services Module (ASASM) in Cisco Catalyst 6500 series devices, with
software 8.3 before 8.3(2.34), 8.4 before 8.4(4.4), 8.5 before
8.5(1.13), and 8.6 before 8.6(1.3) and the Firewall Services Module
(FWSM) 4.1 before 4.1(9) in Cisco Catalyst 6500 series switches and
7600 series routers might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a crafted DCERPC packet, aka Bug IDs CSCtr21359 and
CSCtr27522.
