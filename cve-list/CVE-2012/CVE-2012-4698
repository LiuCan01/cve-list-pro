Siemens RuggedCom Rugged Operating System (ROS) before 3.12, ROX I OS
through 1.14.5, ROX II OS through 2.3.0, and RuggedMax OS through
4.2.1.4621.22 use hardcoded private keys for SSL and SSH
communication, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers
to spoof servers and decrypt network traffic by leveraging the
availability of these keys within ROS files at all customer
installations.
