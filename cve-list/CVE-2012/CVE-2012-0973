Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in OSClass before 2.3.5 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the sCategory
parameter to index.php, which is not properly handled by the (1)
osc_search_category_id function in
oc-includes/osclass/helpers/hSearch.php and (2) findBySlug function
oc-includes/osclass/model/Category.php.  NOTE: some of these details
are obtained from third party information.
