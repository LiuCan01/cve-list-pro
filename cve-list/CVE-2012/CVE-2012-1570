The resolver in MaraDNS before 1.3.0.7.15 and 1.4.x before 1.4.12
overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the
processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote
attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names
via a "ghost domain names" attack.
