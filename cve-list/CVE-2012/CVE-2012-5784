Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal
Mass Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message
Service implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does
not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the
subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
