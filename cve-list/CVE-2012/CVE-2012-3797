Pro-face WinGP PC Runtime 3.1.00 and earlier, and ProServr.exe in
Pro-face Pro-Server EX 1.30.000 and earlier, does not properly check
packet sizes before reusing packet memory buffers, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a short crafted packet with
a certain opcode.
