** DISPUTED **

Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in unixODBC 2.0.10,
2.3.1, and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service
(crash) via a long string in the FILEDSN option.  NOTE: this issue
might not be a vulnerability, since the ability to set this option
typically implies that the attacker already has legitimate access to
cause a DoS or execute code, and therefore the issue would not cross
privilege boundaries. There may be limited attack scenarios if isql
command-line options are exposed to an attacker, although it seems
likely that other, more serious issues would also be exposed, and this
issue might not cross privilege boundaries in that context.
