The intu-help-qb (aka Intuit Help System Async Pluggable Protocol)
handlers in HelpAsyncPluggableProtocol.dll in Intuit QuickBooks 2009
through 2012, when Internet Explorer is used, provide different
responses to remote requests depending on whether a ZIP pathname is
valid, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive
information about the installation path and product version via a
series of requests involving the Msxml2.XMLHTTP object.
