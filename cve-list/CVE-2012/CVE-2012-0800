The form-autocompletion functionality in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.7,
2.1.x before 2.1.4, and 2.2.x before 2.2.1 makes it easier for
physically proximate attackers to discover passwords by reading the
contents of a non-password field, as demonstrated by accessing a
create-groups page with Safari on an iPad device.
