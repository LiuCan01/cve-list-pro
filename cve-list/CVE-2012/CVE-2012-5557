The User Read-Only module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.4 and 7.x-1.x before
7.x-1.4 for Drupal, does not properly assign roles when there are more
than three roles on the site and certain unspecified configurations,
which might allow remote authenticated users to gain privileges by
performing certain operations, as demonstrated by changing a password.
