fcgid_spawn_ctl.c in the mod_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP
Server does not recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for
a virtual host, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of HTTP requests
that triggers a process count higher than the intended limit.
