The create_post function in wp-includes/class-wp-atom-server.php in
WordPress before 3.4.2 does not perform a capability check, which
allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access
restrictions and publish new posts by leveraging the Contributor role
and using the Atom Publishing Protocol (aka AtomPub) feature.
