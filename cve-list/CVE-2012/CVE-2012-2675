Multiple integer overflows in the (1) CallMalloc (malloc) and (2)
nedpcalloc (calloc) functions in nedmalloc (nedmalloc.c) before 1.10
beta2 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform
memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size
value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.
