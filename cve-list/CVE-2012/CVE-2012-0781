The tidy_diagnose function in PHP 5.3.8 might allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
crash) via crafted input to an application that attempts to perform
Tidy::diagnose operations on invalid objects, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-4153.
