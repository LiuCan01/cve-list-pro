** DISPUTED **

MySQL 5.5.19 and possibly other versions, and MariaDB 5.5.28a and
possibly other versions, when configured to assign the FILE privilege
to users who should not have administrative privileges, allows remote
authenticated users to gain privileges by leveraging the FILE
privilege to create files as the MySQL administrator.  NOTE: the vendor
disputes this issue, stating that this is only a vulnerability when
the administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's
installation documentation.  NOTE: it could be argued that this should
not be included in CVE because it is a configuration issue.
