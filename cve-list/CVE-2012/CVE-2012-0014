Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2, 3.5.1, and 4, and Silverlight 4
before 4.1.10111, does not properly restrict access to memory
associated with unmanaged objects, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted XAML browser application (aka
XBAP), (2) a crafted ASP.NET application, (3) a crafted .NET Framework
application, or (4) a crafted Silverlight application, aka ".NET
Framework Unmanaged Objects Vulnerability."
