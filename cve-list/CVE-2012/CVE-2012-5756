The IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance 2.0.0.0 through 2.0.0.3 and
2.1.0.0 through 2.1.0.2, when a collective configuration is enabled,
has a single secret key that is shared across different customers'
installations, which allows remote attackers to spoof a container
server by (1) sniffing the network to locate a cleartext transmission
of this key or (2) leveraging knowledge of this key from another
installation.
