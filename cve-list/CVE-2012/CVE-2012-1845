Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome 17.0.963.66 and earlier
allows remote attackers to bypass the DEP and ASLR protection
mechanisms, and execute arbitrary code, via unspecified vectors, as
demonstrated by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2012.
NOTE: the primary affected product may be clarified later; it was not
identified by the researcher, who reportedly stated "it really doesn't
matter if it's third-party code."
