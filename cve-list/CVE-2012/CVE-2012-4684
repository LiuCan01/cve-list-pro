The alert functionality in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.7.0
supports different character representations of the same signature
data, but relies on a hash of this signature, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a
valid modified signature for a circulating alert.
