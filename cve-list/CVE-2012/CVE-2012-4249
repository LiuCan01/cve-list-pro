The Amazon Lab126 com.lab126.system sendEvent implementation on the
Kindle Touch before 5.1.2 allows context-dependent attackers to
execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a string, as
demonstrated by using lipc-set-prop to set an LIPC property, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4248.
