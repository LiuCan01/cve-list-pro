Best Practical Solutions RT 3.8.x before 3.8.15 and 4.0.x before
4.0.8, when GnuPG is enabled, does not ensure that the UI labels
unencrypted messages as unencrypted, which might make it easier for
remote attackers to spoof details of a message's origin or interfere
with encryption-policy auditing via an e-mail message to a queue's
address.
