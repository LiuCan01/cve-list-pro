Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Reports Developer component in
Oracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.4, 11.1.1.6, and 11.1.2.0 allows
remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown
vectors related to Report Server Component.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the October 2012 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
claims from the original researcher that the URLPARAMETER
functionality allows remote attackers to read and upload arbitrary
files to reports/rwservlet, and that this issue occurs in earlier
versions.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2012-3153 to execute
arbitrary code by uploading a .jsp file.
