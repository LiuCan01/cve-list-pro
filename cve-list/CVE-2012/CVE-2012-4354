TCPIPS_Story.dll in Sielco Sistemi Winlog Pro SCADA before 2.07.17 and
Winlog Lite SCADA before 2.07.17 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a port-46824 TCP packet with a crafted positive
integer after the opcode, triggering incorrect function-pointer
processing that can lead to a buffer overflow.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
