Stack-based buffer overflow in RunTime.exe in Sielco Sistemi Winlog
Pro SCADA before 2.07.17 and Winlog Lite SCADA before 2.07.17 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted port-46824
TCP packet that triggers an incorrect file-open attempt by the
_TCPIPS_BinOpenFileFP function, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2012-3815.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
