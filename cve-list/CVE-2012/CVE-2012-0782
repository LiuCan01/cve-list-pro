** DISPUTED ** Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress
3.3.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the (1) dbhost, (2) dbname, or (3) uname parameter.
NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue; also, it is
unclear whether this specific XSS scenario has security relevance.
