The Device Encryption Client component in Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise
6.0, when a volume-based encryption policy is enabled in conjunction
with a user-defined key, does not properly block use of exFAT USB
flash drives, which makes it easier for local users to bypass intended
access restrictions and copy sensitive information to a drive via
multiple removal and reattach operations.
