Codehaus XFire 1.2.6 and earlier, as used in the Amazon EC2 API Tools
Java library and other products, does not verify that the server
hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate.
