The PayPal module in PrestaShop does not verify that the server
hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate, related to use of the PHP fsockopen function.
