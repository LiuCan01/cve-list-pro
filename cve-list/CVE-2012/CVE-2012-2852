The PDF functionality in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X
and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does
not properly handle object linkage, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted document.
