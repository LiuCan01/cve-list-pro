Unspecified vulnerability in Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.15 and 2.7.x
before 2.7.13, and Puppet Enterprise (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.x,
2.0.x, and 2.5.x before 2.5.1 allows remote authenticated users with
agent SSL keys to (1) cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
via a REST request to a stream that triggers a thread block, as
demonstrated using CVE-2012-1986 and /dev/random; or (2) cause a
denial of service (filesystem consumption) via crafted REST requests
that use "a marshaled form of a Puppet::FileBucket::File object" to
write to arbitrary file locations.
