** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in CRS Manager
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
DOCUMENT_ROOT parameter to (1) index.php or (2) login.php.  NOTE: this
issue is disputed by CVE, since DOCUMENT_ROOT cannot be modified by an
attacker.
