** DISPUTED **

Buffer overflow in the Windows NT Message Compiler (MC) 1.00.5239 on
Microsoft Windows XP allows local users to gain privileges via a long
MC-filename.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a reliable third
party who states that the compiler is not a privileged program, so
privilege boundaries cannot be crossed.
