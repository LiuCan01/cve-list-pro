Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to spoof
the contents of the status bar via a link to a data: URI containing an
encoded URL.  NOTE: the severity of this issue has been disputed by a
reliable third party, since the intended functionality of the status
bar allows it to be modified.
