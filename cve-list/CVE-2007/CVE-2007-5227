Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
messaging/course/composeMessage.jsp in BlackBoard Learning System
6.3.1.593 and earlier in BlackBoard Academic Suite allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) subject_t
and (2) body_text parameters.  NOTE: vector 2 requires bypassing a
client-side security mechanism that attempts to block XSS sequences.
