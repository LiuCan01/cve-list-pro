** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in modules/mail/index.php in
phpCOIN RC-1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
PHP code via a URL in the _CCFG['_PKG_PATH_MDLS'] parameter.  NOTE:
this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party, who states
that a fatal error occurs before the relevant code is reached.
