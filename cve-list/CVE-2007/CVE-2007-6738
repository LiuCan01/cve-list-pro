Reference: CONFIRM:http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/source/browse/trunk/HISTORY

pyftpdlib before 0.1.1 does not choose a random value for the port
associated with the PASV command, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information about the number
of in-progress data connections by reading the response to this
command.
