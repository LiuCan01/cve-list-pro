Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) software before 3.2 20070727, 4.0 before

denial of service (traffic amplification or ARP storm) via a crafted
unicast ARP request that (1) has a destination MAC address unknown to
the Layer-2 infrastructure, aka CSCsj69233; or (2) occurs during
Layer-3 roaming across IP subnets, aka CSCsj70841.
