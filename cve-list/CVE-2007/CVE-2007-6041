Buffer overflow in the Sequencer::queueMessage function in
sequencer.cpp in the server in Rigs of Rods (RoR) before 0.33d SP1
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a nickname, then a
vehicle name in a MSG2_USE_VEHICLE message, in which the combined
length triggers the overflow.
