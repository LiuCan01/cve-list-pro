Multiple input validation errors in ACD ACDSee Photo Manager 9.0 build
108, Pro Photo Manager 8.1 build 99, and Photo Editor 4.0 build 195
allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
long section string in (1) a PSP image to the ID_PSP.apl plug-in or
(2) an LHA archive to the AM_LHA.apl plug-in, resulting in a
heap-based buffer overflow.
