PUBCONV.DLL in Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 does not properly clear
memory when transferring data from disk to memory, which allows
user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
malformed .pub page via a certain negative value, which bypasses a
sanitization procedure that initializes critical pointers to NULL, aka
the "Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability".
