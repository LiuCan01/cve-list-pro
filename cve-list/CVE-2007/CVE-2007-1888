Buffer overflow in the sqlite_decode_binary function in src/encode.c
in SQLite 2, as used by PHP 4.x through 5.x and other applications,
allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via an
empty value of the in parameter.  NOTE: some PHP installations use a
bundled version of sqlite without this vulnerability.  The SQLite
developer has argued that this issue could be due to a misuse of the
sqlite_decode_binary() API.
