Audacity 1.3.2 creates a temporary directory with a predictable name
without checking for previous existence of that directory, which
allows local users to cause a denial of service (recording deadlock)
by creating the directory before Audacity is run.  NOTE: this issue
can be leveraged to delete arbitrary files or directories via a
symlink attack.
