The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 1.2.22 and
1.4.x before 1.4.8, Business Edition before B.2.2.1, AsteriskNOW
before beta7, Appliance Developer Kit before 0.5.0, and s800i before
1.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
a crafted (1) LAGRQ or (2) LAGRP frame that contains information
elements of IAX frames, which results in a NULL pointer dereference
when Asterisk does not properly set an associated variable.
