The original patch for CVE-2007-3999 in svc_auth_gss.c in the
RPCSEC_GSS RPC library in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.4 through 1.6.2, as
used by the Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) and other
applications that use krb5, does not correctly check the buffer length
in some environments and architectures, which might allow remote
attackers to conduct a buffer overflow attack.
