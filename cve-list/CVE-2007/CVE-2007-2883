Credant Mobile Guardian Shield for Windows 5.2.1.105 and earlier
stores account names and passwords in plaintext in memory, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information by (1) reading the
paging file or (2) dumping and searching the memory image.  NOTE: This
issue crosses privilege boundaries because the product is intended to
protect the data on a stolen computer.
