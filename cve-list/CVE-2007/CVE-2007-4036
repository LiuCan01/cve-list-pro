** DISPUTED **

Guidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via (1) a corrupted Microsoft Exchange
database, which triggers an application crash when many options are
selected; (2) a corrupted NTFS filesystem, which causes the
application to report "memory allocation errors;" or (3) deeply nested
directories, which trigger an application crash during an Expand All
action. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these vectors
because the user can select fewer options, there is no operational
impact, or the user can do less expansion.
