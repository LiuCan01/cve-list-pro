Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Ip Reg 0.3 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the vlan_id parameter
to (1) vlanview.php, (2) vlanedit.php, and (3) vlandel.php; the (4)
assetclassgroup_id parameter to assetclassgroupview.php; the (5)
subnet_id parameter to nodelist.php; and unspecified other vectors.
NOTE: it was later reported that the vlanview.php and vlandel.php
vectors are also in 0.4.
