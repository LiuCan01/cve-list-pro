The dataconn function in ftpd.c in netkit ftpd (netkit-ftpd) 0.17,
when certain modifications to support SSL have been introduced, calls
fclose on an uninitialized file stream, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly have
unspecified other impact via some types of FTP over SSL protocol
behavior, as demonstrated by breaking a passive FTP DATA connection in
a way that triggers an error in the server's SSL_accept function.
NOTE: the netkit ftp issue is covered by CVE-2007-5769.
