Apache Tomcat 5.5.11 through 5.5.25 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.15, when the
native APR connector is used, does not properly handle an empty
request to the SSL port, which allows remote attackers to trigger
handling of "a duplicate copy of one of the recent requests," as
demonstrated by using netcat to send the empty request.
