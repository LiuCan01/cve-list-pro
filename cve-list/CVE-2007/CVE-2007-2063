SSH Tectia Server for IBM z/OS before 5.4.0 uses insecure
world-writable permissions for (1) the server pid file, which allows
local users to cause arbitrary processes to be stopped, or (2) when
_BPX_BATCH_UMASK is missing from the environment, creates HFS files
with insecure permissions, which allows local users to read or modify
these files and have other unknown impact.
