** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in PHPEcho CMS 2.0
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
(1) _plugin_file parameter to smarty/internals/core.load_pulgins.php
or the (2) root_path parameter to index.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes (1)
because the inclusion occurs within a function that is not called
during a direct request. CVE disputes (2) because root_path is defined
in config.php before use.
