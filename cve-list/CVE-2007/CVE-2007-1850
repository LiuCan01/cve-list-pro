Directory traversal vulnerability in classes/captcha/captcha.jpg.php
in Drake CMS allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or list
arbitrary directories, and obtain the installation path, via a .. (dot
dot) in the d_private parameter.  NOTE: Drake CMS has only a beta
version available, and the vendor has previously stated "We do not
consider security reports valid until the first official release of
Drake CMS."
