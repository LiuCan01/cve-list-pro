Stack-based buffer overflow in the zip:// URL wrapper in PECL ZIP
1.8.3 and earlier, as bundled with PHP 5.2.0 and 5.2.1, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long zip:// URL, as
demonstrated by actively triggering URL access from a remote PHP
interpreter via avatar upload or blog pingback.
