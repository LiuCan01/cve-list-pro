Visual truncation vulnerability in WinImage 8.10 and earlier allows
remote attackers to spoof a destination filename via a long sequence
of space characters in a filename within a (1) .IMG or (2) .ISO file.
NOTE: this can be leveraged with a separate directory traversal
vulnerability to trick a careful user into overwriting arbitrary
files.
