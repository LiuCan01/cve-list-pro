** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
html/modules/extranet_profile/main.php in openEngine 1.9 beta1 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
this_module_path parameter.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE
because PHP encounters a fatal function-call error on a direct request
for the file, before reaching the include statement.
