Cisco Secure Services Client (CSSC) 4.x, Trust Agent 1.x and 2.x,
Cisco Security Agent (CSA) 5.0 and 5.1 (when a vulnerable Trust Agent
has been deployed), and the Meetinghouse AEGIS SecureConnect Client
use an insecure default Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACL) for
the connection client GUI, which allows local users to gain privileges
by injecting "a thread under ConnectionClient.exe," aka CSCsg20558.
