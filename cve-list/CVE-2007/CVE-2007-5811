** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in PageTraiteDownload.php in
phpMyConferences 8.0.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the dir parameter.  NOTE: this
issue is disputed for 8.0.2 by a reliable third party, who notes that
the PHP code is syntactically incorrect and cannot be executed.
