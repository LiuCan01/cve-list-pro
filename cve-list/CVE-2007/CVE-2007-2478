Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the IRC component in Cerulean
Studios Trillian Pro before 3.1.5.1 allow remote attackers to corrupt
memory and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a URL with a long
UTF-8 string, which triggers the overflow when the user highlights it,
or (2) a font HTML tag with a face attribute containing a long UTF-8
string.
