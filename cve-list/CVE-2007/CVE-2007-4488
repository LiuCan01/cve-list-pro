Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Siemens
Gigaset SE361 WLAN router with firmware 1.00.0 allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the portion of the URI
immediately following the filename for (1) a GIF filename, which
triggers display of the GIF file in text format and an unspecified
denial of service (crash); or (2) the login.tri filename, which
triggers a continuous loop of the browser attempting to visit the
login page.
