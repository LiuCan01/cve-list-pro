The comment_form_add_preview function in comment.module in Drupal
before 4.7.6, and 5.x before 5.1, and vbDrupal, allows remote
attackers with "post comments" privileges and access to multiple input
filters to execute arbitrary code by previewing comments, which are
not processed by "normal form validation routines."
