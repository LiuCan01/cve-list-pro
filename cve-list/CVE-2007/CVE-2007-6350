scponly 4.6 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to bypass
intended restrictions and execute code by invoking dangerous
subcommands including (1) unison, (2) rsync, (3) svn, and (4)
svnserve, as originally demonstrated by creating a Subversion (SVN)
repository with malicious hooks, then using svn to trigger execution
of those hooks.
