Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Xythos
Enterprise Document Manager (XEDM) before 5.0.25.8, and 6.x before
6.0.46.1, allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via (1) a saved Workflow name; (2) a Workflow name,
related to deletion of a Workflow template; (3) the Content-Type HTTP
header; or (4) the name of an uploaded file.  NOTE: items 3 and 4 also
affect the same version numbers of Xythos Digital Locker (XDL). Some
or all vectors might also affect Xythos WebFile Server.
