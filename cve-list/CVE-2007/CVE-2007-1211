Unspecified kernel GDI functions in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4; XP
SP2; and Server 2003 Gold, SP1, and SP2 allows user-assisted remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (possibly persistent restart)
via a crafted Windows Metafile (WMF) image that causes an invalid
dereference of an offset in a kernel structure, a related issue to
CVE-2005-4560.
