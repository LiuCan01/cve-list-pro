Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the save function in
Obedit 3.03 allows user-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via unknown vectors, as demonstrated by a SCRIPT
element in an unspecified context when saving a document.  NOTE:
because the details of the attack are uncertain, it is unclear whether
this crosses privilege boundaries.
