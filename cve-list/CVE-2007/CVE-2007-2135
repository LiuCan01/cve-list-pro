The ADI_BINARY component in the Oracle E-Business Suite allows remote
attackers to download arbitrary documents from the APPS.FND_DOCUMENTS
table via the ADI_DISPLAY_REPORT function, when passed a certain
parameter.  NOTE: due to lack of details from Oracle, it is not clear
whether this issue is related to other CVE identifiers such as
CVE-2007-2126, CVE-2007-2127, or CVE-2007-2128.
