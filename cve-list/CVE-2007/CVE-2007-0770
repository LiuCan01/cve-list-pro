Buffer overflow in GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick allows user-assisted
remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a PALM image that is not properly handled by the
ReadPALMImage function in coders/palm.c. NOTE: this issue is due to an
incomplete patch for CVE-2006-5456.
