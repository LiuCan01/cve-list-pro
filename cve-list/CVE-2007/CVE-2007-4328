Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Mapos Bilder
Galerie 1.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the config[root_ordner] parameter to (1) index.php, (2)
galerie.php, or (3) anzagien.php.  NOTE: A later report states that
1.1 is also affected, but that the filename for vector 3 is
anzeigen.php.
