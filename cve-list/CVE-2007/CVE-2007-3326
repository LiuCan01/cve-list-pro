Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/34956

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in vBulletin 3.x.x allow
remote attackers to redirect visitors to arbitrary local files via a
.. (dot dot) in (1) the loc parameter to admincp/index.php and (2) the
Hyperlink information URl field for post Topic in showthread.php,
enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2005-3025.2.
