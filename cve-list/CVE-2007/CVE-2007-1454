ext/filter in PHP 5.2.0, when FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is used with the
FILTER_FLAG_STRIP_LOW flag, does not properly strip HTML tags, which
allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
via HTML with a '<' character followed by certain whitespace
characters, which passes one filter but is collapsed into a valid tag,
as demonstrated using %0b.
