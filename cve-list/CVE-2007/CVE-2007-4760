The javadoc tool in Cosminexus Developer's Kit for Java in Cosminexus
7 and 7.5 can generate HTML documents that contain cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.  NOTE:
this is probably the same issue as CVE-2007-3503.
