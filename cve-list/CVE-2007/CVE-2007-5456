Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 and earlier allows remote attackers to
bypass the "File Download - Security Warning" dialog box and download
arbitrary .exe files by placing a '?' (question mark) followed by a
non-.exe filename after the .exe filename, as demonstrated by (1)
.txt, (2) .cda, (3) .log, (4) .dif, (5) .sol, (6) .htt, (7) .itpc, (8)
.itms, (9) .dvr-ms, (10) .dib, (11) .asf, (12) .tif, and unspecified
other extensions, a different issue than CVE-2004-1331.  NOTE: this
issue might not cross privilege boundaries, although it does bypass an
intended protection mechanism.
