Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Oracle JInitiator ActiveX
control (beans.ocx) 1.1.8.16 and earlier, as used by Oracle Forms
applications from Oracle and third parties, allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via unspecified "initialization parameters."
NOTE: it was later reported that 1.1.8.3 through 1.1.8.25, and
probably 1.1.5.x and 1.1.7.x, are affected.
