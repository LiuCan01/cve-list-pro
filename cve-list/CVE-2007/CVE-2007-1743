suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 does not verify
combinations of user and group IDs on the command line, which might
allow local users to leverage other vulnerabilities to create
arbitrary UID/GID owned files if /proc is mounted.  NOTE: the
researcher, who is reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue
because "the attacks described rely on an insecure server
configuration" in which the user "has write access to the document
root."  In addition, because this is dependent on other
vulnerabilities, perhaps this is resultant and should not be included
in CVE.
