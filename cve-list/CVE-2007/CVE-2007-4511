The Sun Admin Console in Sun Application Server 9.0_0.1 does not apply
certain configuration changes persistently, which causes the (1) SSL
and (2) SSL_MutualAuth ORB listener services to enable all protocols
and ciphers after the services are restarted, possibly allowing remote
attackers to bypass intended policy.
