Buffer overflow in the LWZReadByte function in IMG_gif.c in SDL_image
before 1.2.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
GIF file, a similar issue to CVE-2006-4484.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
