Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Free LAN In(tra|ter)net
Portal (FLIP) before 1.0-RC3 allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: some sources
mention the escape_sqlData, implode_sql, and implode_sqlIn functions,
but these are protection schemes, not the vulnerable functions.
