** DISPUTED **

Buffer overflow in the SMB_Connect_Server function in FreeRadius 1.1.3
and earlier allows attackers to execute arbitrary code related to the
server desthost field of an SMB_Handle_Type instance.  NOTE: the
impact of this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party and
the vendor, who states that exploitation is limited "only to local
administrators who have write access to the server configuration
files."  CVE concurs with the dispute.
