Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in HYIP Manager Pro
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
plugin_file parameter to (1) Smarty.class.php and (2)
Smarty_Compiler.class.php in inc/libs/; (3)
core.display_debug_console.php, (4) core.load_plugins.php, (5)
core.load_resource_plugin.php, (6) core.process_cached_inserts.php,
(7) core.process_compiled_include.php, and (8)
core.read_cache_file.php in inc/libs/core/; and other unspecified
files.  NOTE: (1) and (2) might be incorrectly reported vectors in
Smarty.
