The login method in LoginModule implementations in Apache Geronimo 2.0
does not throw FailedLoginException for failed logins, which allows
remote attackers to bypass authentication requirements, deploy
arbitrary modules, and gain administrative access by sending a blank
username and password with the command line deployer in the deployment
module.
