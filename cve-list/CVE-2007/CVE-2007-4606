PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in convert/mvcw_conver.php in
the Virtual War (VWar) module for PHPNuke-Clan (PNC) 4.2.0 and earlier
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
vwar_root parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-1602.  NOTE: it
is possible that this issue stems from a problem in VWar itself.
