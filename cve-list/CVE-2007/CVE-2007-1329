Directory traversal vulnerability in SQL-Ledger, and LedgerSMB before
1.1.5, allows remote attackers to read and overwrite arbitrary files,
and execute arbitrary code, via . (dot) characters adjacent to (1)
users and (2) users/members strings, which are removed by blacklisting
functions that filter these strings and collapse into .. (dot dot)
sequences.
