Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in tellmatic 1.0.7
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
tm_includepath parameter to (1) Classes.inc.php, (2)
statistic.inc.php, (3) status.inc.php, (4) status_top_x.inc.php, or
(5) libchart-1.1/libchart.php in include/.  NOTE: access to include/
is blocked by .htaccess in most deployments that use Apache HTTP
Server.
