** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
lib/classes/offl_nflteam.php in Online Fantasy Football League (OFFL)
0.2.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL
in the DOC_ROOT parameter.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE
because a __FILE__ test protects offl_nflteam.php against direct
requests.
