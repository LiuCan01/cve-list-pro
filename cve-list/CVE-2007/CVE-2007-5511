SQL injection vulnerability in Workspace Manager for Oracle Database
before OWM 10.2.0.4.1, OWM 10.1.0.8.0, and OWM 9.2.0.8.0 allows
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the FINDRICSET
procedure in the LT package.  NOTE: this is probably covered by
CVE-2007-5510, but there are insufficient details to be certain.
