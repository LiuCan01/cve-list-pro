** DISPUTED **

The Apache HTTP Server, when accessed through a TCP connection with a
large window size, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (network bandwidth consumption) via a Range header that
specifies multiple copies of the same fragment.  NOTE: the severity of
this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that the
large window size required by the attack is not normally supported or
configured by the server, or that a DDoS-style attack would accomplish
the same goal.
