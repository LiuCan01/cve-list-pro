Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Search
Module in PHP-Nuke allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via a trailing "<" instead of a ">" in (1) the onerror
attribute of an IMG element, (2) the onload attribute of an IFRAME
element, or (3) redirect users to other sites via the META tag.
