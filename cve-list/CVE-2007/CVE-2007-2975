The admin console in Ignite Realtime Openfire 3.3.0 and earlier
(formerly Wildfire) does not properly specify a filter mapping in
web.xml, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges and execute
arbitrary code by accessing functionality that is exposed through DWR,
as demonstrated using the downloader.
