The Disk Mount scanner in Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh 9.x and
10.x, Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh 10.0 and 10.1, and Norton
Internet Security for Macintosh 3.x, uses a directory with weak
permissions (group writable), which allows local admin users to gain
root privileges by replacing unspecified files, which are executed
when a user with physical access inserts a disk and the "Show Progress
During Mount Scans" option is enabled.
