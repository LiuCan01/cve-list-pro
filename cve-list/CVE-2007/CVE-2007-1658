Windows Mail in Microsoft Windows Vista might allow user-assisted
remote attackers to execute certain programs via a link to a (1) local
file or (2) UNC share pathname in which there is a directory with the
same base name as an executable program at the same level, as
demonstrated using C:/windows/system32/winrm (winrm.cmd) and migwiz
(migwiz.exe).
