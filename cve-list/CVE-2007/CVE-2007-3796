The password reset feature in the Spam Quarantine HTTP interface for
MailMarshal SMTP 6.2.0.x before 6.2.1 allows remote attackers to
modify arbitrary account information via a UserId variable with a
large amount of trailing whitespace followed by a malicious value,
which triggers SQL buffer truncation due to length inconsistencies
between variables.
