SQL injection vulnerability in MKPortal 1.1.1 allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors, aka
ZD-00000008.  this information is based upon a vague advisory by a
vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate
with vendors or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned
for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to
determine.
