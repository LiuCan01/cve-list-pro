The import_request_variables function in PHP 4.0.7 through 4.4.6, and
5.x before 5.2.2, when called without a prefix, does not prevent the
(1) GET, (2) POST, (3) COOKIE, (4) FILES, (5) SERVER, (6) SESSION, and
other superglobals from being overwritten, which allows remote
attackers to spoof source IP address and Referer data, and have other
unspecified impact.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design
limitation of PHP and that only the misuse of this feature,
i.e. implementation bugs in applications, should be included in CVE.
However, it has been fixed by the vendor.
