Directory traversal vulnerability in a certain ActiveX control in
Nessus Vulnerability Scanner 3.0.6 allows remote attackers to create
or overwrite arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the argument to the
saveNessusRC method, which writes text specified by the addsetConfig
method, possibly related to the SCANCTRL.ScanCtrlCtrl.1 ActiveX
control in scan.dll.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by
writing to a Startup folder.
