The process scheduler in the Sun Solaris kernel does not make use of
the process statistics kept by the kernel and performs scheduling
based upon CPU billing gathered from periodic process sampling ticks,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption), as described in "Secretly Monopolizing the CPU Without
Superuser Privileges."
