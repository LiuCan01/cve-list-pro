Reference: XF:file-assert-code-execution(34731)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/34731

Integer overflow in the "file" program 4.20, when running on 32-bit
systems, as used in products including The Sleuth Kit, might allow
user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large file
that triggers an overflow that bypasses an assert() statement.  NOTE:
this issue is due to an incorrect patch for CVE-2007-1536.
