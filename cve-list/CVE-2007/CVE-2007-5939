The gss_userok function in appl/ftp/ftpd/gss_userok.c in Heimdal 0.7.2
does not allocate memory for the ticketfile pointer before calling
free, which allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via an
invalid username.  NOTE: the vulnerability was originally reported for
ftpd.c, but this is incorrect.
