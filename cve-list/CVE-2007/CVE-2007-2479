Cerulean Studios Trillian Pro before 3.1.5.1 allows remote attackers
to obtain potentially sensitive information via long CTCP PING
messages that contain UTF-8 characters, which generates a malformed
response that is not truncated by a newline, which can cause portions
of a server message to be sent to the attacker.
