The Nortel UNIStim IP Softphone 2050, IP Phone 1140E, and additional
Nortel products from the IP Phone, Business Communications Manager
(BCM), and other product lines allow remote attackers to eavesdrop on
the physical environment via an Open Audio Stream message that enables
"surveillance mode." NOTE: issues relating to a small ID number space
can be leveraged to make this attack easier.
