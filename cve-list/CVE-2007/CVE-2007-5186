PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in Segue CMS
1.8.4 and earlier, when register_globals is disabled, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the themesdir
parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-5497.  NOTE: this issue
was disputed, but the dispute was retracted after additional analysis.
