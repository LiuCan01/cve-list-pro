Directory traversal vulnerability in Ragnarok Online Control Panel
4.3.4a, when the Apache HTTP Server is used, allows remote attackers
to bypass authentication via directory traversal sequences in a URI
that ends with the name of a publicly available page, as demonstrated
by a "/...../" sequence and an account_manage.php/login.php final
component for reaching the protected account_manage.php page.
