The nvcoaft51 driver in Norman Virus Control (NVC) 5.82 uses weak
permissions (unrestricted write access) for the NvcOa device, which
allows local users to gain privileges by (1) triggering a buffer
overflow in a kernel pool via a string argument to ioctl 0xBF67201C;
or by (2) sending a crafted KEVENT structure through ioctl 0xBF672028
to overwrite arbitrary memory locations.
