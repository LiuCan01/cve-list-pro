SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in the SimpleFAQ
(com_simplefaq) 2.11 component for Mambo allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary SQL commands via the aid parameter.  NOTE: it was
later reported that 2.40 is also affected, and that the component can
be used in Joomla! in addition to Mambo.
