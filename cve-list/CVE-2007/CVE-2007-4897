pwlib, as used by Ekiga 2.0.5 and possibly other products, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via
a long argument to the PString::vsprintf function, related to a
"memory management flaw". NOTE: this issue was originally reported as
being in the SIPURL::GetHostAddress function in Ekiga (formerly
GnomeMeeting).
