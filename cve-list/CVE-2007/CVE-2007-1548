SQL injection vulnerability in functions/functions_filters.asp in Web
Wiz Forums before 8.05a (MySQL version) does not properly filter

execute arbitrary SQL commands via "' (backslash double-quote quote)
sequences, which are collapsed into '', as demonstrated via the name
parameter to forum/pop_up_member_search.asp.
