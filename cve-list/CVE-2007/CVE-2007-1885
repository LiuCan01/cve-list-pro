Reference: XF:php-strreplace-bo(33767)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/33767

Integer overflow in the str_replace function in PHP 4 before 4.4.5 and
PHP 5 before 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a single character search string in conjunction
with a long replacement string, which overflows a 32 bit length
counter.  NOTE: this is probably the same issue as CVE-2007-0906.6.
