The (1) Activity Monitor.app/Contents/Resources/pmTool, (2) Keychain
Access.app/Contents/Resources/kcproxy, and (3) ODBC
Administrator.app/Contents/Resources/iodbcadmintool programs in
/Applications/Utilities/ in Mac OS X 10.4.8 have weak permissions
(writable by admin group), which allows local admin users to gain root
privileges by modifying a program and then performing permissions
repair via diskutil.
