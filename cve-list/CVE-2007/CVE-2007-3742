WebKit in Apple Safari 3 Beta before Update 3.0.3, and iPhone before
1.0.1, does not properly handle the interaction between International
Domain Name (IDN) support and Unicode fonts, which allows remote
attackers to create a URL containing "look-alike characters"
(homographs) and possibly perform phishing attacks.
