includes/functions.php in Craig Knudsen WebCalendar before 1.0.5 does
not protect the noSet variable from external modification, which
allows remote attackers to set arbitrary global variables via a URL
with modified values in the noSet parameter, which leads to resultant
vulnerabilities that probably include remote file inclusion and other
issues.
