Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 and
10.2.0.2 have unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors,
related to (1) Change Data Capture (CDC), aka DB08, and (2) Oracle
Instant Client, aka DB11.  NOTE: as of 20070424, oracle has not
disputed reliable claims that these issues are buffer overflows using
a long CHANGE_TABLE_NAME parameter to the
DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH.CHGTAB_CACHE procedure (DB08) and Oracle Instant
Client genezi utility (DB11).
