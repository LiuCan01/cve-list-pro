Multiple buffer overflows in FileZilla before 2.2.30a allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(application crash) via unspecified vectors related to (1) Options.cpp
when storing settings in the registry, and (2) the transfer queue
(QueueCtrl.cpp).  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
