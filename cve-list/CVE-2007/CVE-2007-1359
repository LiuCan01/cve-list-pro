Interpretation conflict in ModSecurity (mod_security) 2.1.0 and
earlier allows remote attackers to bypass request rules via
application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST data that contains an ASCIIZ
(0x00) byte, which mod_security treats as a terminator even though it
is still processed as normal data by some HTTP parsers including PHP
5.2.0, and possibly parsers in Perl, and Python.
