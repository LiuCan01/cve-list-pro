The AToZed IntraWeb component 8.0 and earlier for Borland Delphi and
Kylix, and IntraWeb 9.0 before build (9.0.12), allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (thread hang or CPU consumption) via a
crafted HTTP request, related to the OnBeforeDispatch function in the
TIWServerController object.
