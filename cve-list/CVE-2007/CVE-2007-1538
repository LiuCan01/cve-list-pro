** DISPUTED **

McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.5.0.i uses insecure permissions for
certain Windows Registry keys, which allows local users to bypass
local password protection via the UIP value in (1)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMcAfeeDesktopProtection or (2)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARENetwork AssociatesTVDVirusScan
EntrepriseCurrentVersion.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by
third-party researchers, stating that the default permissions for
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE does not allow for write access and the
product does not modify the inherited permissions. There might be an
interaction error with another product.
