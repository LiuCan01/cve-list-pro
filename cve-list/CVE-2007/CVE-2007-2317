Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in MiniBB Forum
1.5a and earlier, as used by TOSMO/Mambo 4.0.12 and probably other
products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the absolute_path parameter to bb_plugins.php in (1)
components/minibb/ or (2) components/com_minibb, or (3)
configuration.php.  NOTE: the com_minibb.php vector is already covered
by CVE-2006-3690.
