** DISPUTED **

SQL injection vulnerability in inc/common.php in GlobalMegaCorp dvddb
0.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the
user parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a reliable
third party, who states that inc/common.php only contains function
definitions.
