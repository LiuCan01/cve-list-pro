cmdmon.sys in Comodo Firewall Pro (formerly Comodo Personal Firewall)
before 2.4.16.174 does not validate arguments that originate in user
mode for the (1) NtConnectPort and (2) NtCreatePort hooked SSDT
functions, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(system crash) and possibly gain privileges via invalid arguments.
