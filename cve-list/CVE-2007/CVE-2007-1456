** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in common.php in PHP Photo
Album allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL
in the db_file parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability,
because versions 0.3.2.6 and 0.4.1beta do not contain this file.
However, it is possible that the original researcher was referring to
a different product.
