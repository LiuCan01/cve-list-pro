Buffer overflow in Yahoo! Messenger 8.1 allows user-assisted remote
authenticated users, who are listed in an address book, to execute
arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, aka ZD-00000005.  NOTE: this
information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability
information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors
or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned for tracking
purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to determine.
