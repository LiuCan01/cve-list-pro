Word (or Word Viewer) in Microsoft Office 2000 SP3, XP SP3, 2003 SP2,
2004 for Mac, and Works Suite 2004, 2005, and 2006 does not properly
parse certain rich text "property strings of certain control words,"
which allows user-assisted remote attackers to trigger heap corruption
and execute arbitrary code, aka the "Word RTF Parsing Vulnerability."
