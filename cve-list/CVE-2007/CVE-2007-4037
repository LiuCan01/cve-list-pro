** DISPUTED **

Guidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted attackers to trigger a
buffer over-read and application crash via a malformed NTFS filesystem
containing a modified FILE record with a certain large offset. NOTE:
the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, asserting that
relevant attackers typically do not corrupt a filesystem, and
indicating that the relevant read operation can be disabled.
