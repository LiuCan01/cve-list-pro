** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in cgi-bin/reorder2.asp in
SalesCart Shopping Cart allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
SQL commands via the password field and other unspecified
vectors. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating "We were able
to reproduce this sql injection on an old out-of-date demo on the
website but not on the released product."
