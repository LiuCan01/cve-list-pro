The Access Control functionality (JMXOpsAccessControlFilter) in JMX
Console in JBoss Application Server 4.0.2 and 4.0.5 before 20070416
uses a member variable to store the roles of the current user, which
allows remote authenticated administrators to trigger a race condition
and gain privileges by logging in during a session by a more
privileged administrator, as demonstrated by privilege escalation from
Read Mode to Write Mode.
