Integer overflow in Firebird 2.0.0 allows remote authenticated users
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via certain database
operations with multi-byte character sets that trigger an attempt to
use the value 65536 for a 16-bit integer, which is treated as 0 and
causes an infinite loop on zero-length data.
