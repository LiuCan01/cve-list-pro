Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Bitweaver 2.0.0 and earlier
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1)
sort_mode parameter to wiki/list_pages.php and the (2) highlight
parameter to search/index.php.  NOTE: the researcher also reported
injection via JavaScript code in the Search box, but this is probably
a forced SQL error or other separate primary issue.
