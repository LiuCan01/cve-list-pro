Check Point ZoneAlarm Pro before 6.5.737.000 does not properly test
for equivalence of process identifiers for certain Microsoft Windows
API functions in the NT kernel 5.0 and greater, which allows local
users to call these functions, and bypass firewall rules or gain
privileges, via a modified identifier that is one, two, or three
greater than the canonical identifier.
