Integer overflow in the ffs_mountfs function in Mac OS X 10.4.8 and
FreeBSD 6.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic)
and possibly gain privileges via a crafted DMG image that causes
"allocation of a negative size buffer" leading to a heap-based buffer
overflow, a related issue to CVE-2006-5679.  NOTE: a third party
states that this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in FreeBSD
because only root may mount a filesystem.
