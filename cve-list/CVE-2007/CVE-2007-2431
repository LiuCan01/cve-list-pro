Dynamic variable evaluation vulnerability in
shared/config/tce_config.php in TCExam 4.0.011 and earlier allows
remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and possibly
other attacks by modifying critical variables such as $_SERVER, as
demonstrated by injecting web script via the _SERVER[SCRIPT_NAME]
parameter.
