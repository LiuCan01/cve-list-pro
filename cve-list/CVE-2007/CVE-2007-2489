Heap-based buffer overflow in LiveData Protocol Server 5.00.045, and
other versions before update 500062 (5.00.062), allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted request for a WSDL file that causes a
negative length to be used in a strncpy call.
