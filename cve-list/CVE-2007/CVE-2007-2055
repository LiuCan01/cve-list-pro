AFFLIB 2.2.8 and earlier allows attackers to execute arbitrary
commands via shell metacharacters involving (1) certain command line
parameters in tools/afconvert.cpp and (2) arguments to the
get_parameter function in aimage/ident.cpp.  NOTE: it is unknown if the
get_parameter vector (2) is ever called.
