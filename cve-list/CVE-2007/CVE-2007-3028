The LDAP service in Windows Active Directory in Microsoft Windows 2000
Server SP4 does not properly check "the number of convertible
attributes", which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (service unavailability) via a crafted LDAP request, related
to "client sent LDAP request logic," aka "Windows Active Directory
Denial of Service Vulnerability".  NOTE: this is probably a different
issue than CVE-2007-0040.
