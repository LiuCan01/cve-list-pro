Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the use of FD_SET in TCPreen
before 1.4.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via
multiple concurrent connections, which result in overflows in the (1)
SocketAddress::Connect function in libsolve/sockprot.cpp and (2)
monitor_bridge function in src/bridge.cpp.
