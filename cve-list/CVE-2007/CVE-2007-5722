Stack-based buffer overflow in a certain ActiveX control in GLChat.ocx
2.5.1.32 in GlobalLink 2.7.0.8, as used in Ourgame GLWorld and
possibly other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a long first argument to the ConnectAndEnterRoom method,
possibly involving the GLCHAT.GLChatCtrl.1 control, as originally
exploited in the wild in October 2007.  NOTE: some of these details
are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: this was originally
reported as a heap-based issue by some sources.
