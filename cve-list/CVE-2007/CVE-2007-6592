Apple Safari 2, when a user accepts an SSL server certificate on the
basis of the CN domain name in the DN field, regards the certificate
as also accepted for all domain names in subjectAltName:dNSName
fields, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user
into accepting an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site.
