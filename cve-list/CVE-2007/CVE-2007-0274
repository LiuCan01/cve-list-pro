Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 9.2.0.7 and
10.1.0.5 have unknown impact and attack vectors related to (1) Export
and sys.dbms_logrep_util (DB08), and (2) Oracle Streams and
sys.dbms_capture_adm_internal privileges (DB09).  NOTE: Oracle has not
disputed reliable researcher claims that DB08 is for a buffer overflow
in the GET_OBJECT_NAME procedure in the DBMS_LOGREP_UTIL package, and
DB09 is for buffer overflows in the CREATE_CAPTURE, ALTER_CAPTURE, and
ABORT_TABLE_INSTANTIATION procedures in SYS.DBMS_CAPTURE_ADM_INTERNAL.
