The ftp_PORT function in FTPServer.py in pyftpdlib before 0.2.0 does
not prevent TCP connections to privileged ports if the destination IP
address matches the source IP address of the connection from the FTP
client, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct FTP
bounce attacks via crafted FTP data, as demonstrated by an FTP bounce
attack against a NAT server, a related issue to CVE-1999-0017.
