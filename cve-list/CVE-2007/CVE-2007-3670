Reference: XF:ie-firefoxurl-command-execution(35346)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/35346

Argument injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer, when
running on systems with Firefox installed and certain URIs registered,
allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser scripting attacks and
execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a (1)
FirefoxURL or (2) FirefoxHTML URI, which are inserted into the command
line that is created when invoking firefox.exe.  NOTE: it has been
debated as to whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or Firefox.
As of 20070711, it is CVE's opinion that IE appears to be failing to
properly delimit the URL argument when invoking Firefox, and this
issue could arise with other protocol handlers in IE as well.
However, Mozilla has stated that it will address the issue with a
"defense in depth" fix that will "prevent IE from sending Firefox
malicious data."
