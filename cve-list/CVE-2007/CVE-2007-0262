WordPress 2.0.6, and 2.1Alpha 3 (SVN:4662), does not properly verify
that the m parameter value has the string data type, which allows
remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid m[]
parameter, as demonstrated by obtaining the path, and obtaining
certain SQL information such as the table prefix.
