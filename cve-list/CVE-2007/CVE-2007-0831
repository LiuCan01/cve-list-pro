** DISPUTED ** Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in
Atsphp 5.0.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
a URL in the CONF[path] parameter to (1) index.php, (2)
sources/usercp.php, or (3) sources/admin.php.  NOTE: Another researcher
has disputed this vulnerability, noting that CONF[path] is defined
before use in index.php, that CONF[path] inclusion cannot occur
through a direct request to other affected files, and that usercp.php
is a typo of user_cp.php.
