Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the AXIS
2100 Network Camera 2.02 with firmware 2.43 and earlier allow remote
attackers to perform actions as administrators, as demonstrated by (1)
an SMTP server change through the conf_SMTP_MailServer1 parameter to
ServerManager.srv and (2) a hostname change through the
conf_Network_HostName parameter on the Network page.
