The Foreign Function Interface (ffi) extension in PHP 5.0.5 does not
follow safe_mode restrictions, which allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code by loading an arbitrary DLL and
calling a function, as demonstrated by kernel32.dll and the WinExec
function.  NOTE: this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in
most contexts, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.
