The parse_str function in (1) PHP, (2) Hardened-PHP, and (3) Suhosin,
when called without a second parameter, might allow remote attackers
to overwrite arbitrary variables by specifying variable names and
values in the string to be parsed.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this
is a design limitation of the function or a bug in PHP, although it is
likely to be regarded as a bug in Hardened-PHP and Suhosin.
