index.php in Domenico Mancini PicoFlat CMS before 0.4.18 allows remote
attackers to include certain files via unspecified vectors, possibly
due to a directory traversal vulnerability.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged to bypass authentication and upload files by including
pico_insert.php or unspecified other administrative scripts.  NOTE:
some of these details are obtained from third party information.
