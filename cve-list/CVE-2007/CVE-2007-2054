Multiple format string vulnerabilities in AFFLIB before 2.2.6 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain command line
parameters, which are used in (1) warn and (2) err calls in (a)
lib/s3.cpp, (b) tools/afconvert.cpp, (c) tools/afcopy.cpp, (d)
tools/afinfo.cpp, (e) aimage/aimage.cpp, (f) aimage/imager.cpp, and
(g) tools/afxml.cpp.  NOTE: the aimage.cpp vector (e) has since been
recalled from the researcher's original advisory, since the code is
not called in any version of AFFLIB.
