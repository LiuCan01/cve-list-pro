Multiple race conditions in suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3
between directory and file validation, and their usage, allow local
users to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code by renaming
directories or performing symlink attacks. NOTE: the researcher, who
is reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue because "the
attacks described rely on an insecure server configuration" in which
the user "has write access to the document root."
