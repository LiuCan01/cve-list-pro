Gesytec Easylon OPC Server before 2.3.44 does not properly validate
server handles, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code or cause a denial of service via unspecified network traffic to
the OLE for Process Control (OPC) interface, probably related to free
operations on arbitrary memory addresses through certain Remove
functions, and read and write operations on arbitrary memory addresses
through certain Set, Read, and Write functions.
