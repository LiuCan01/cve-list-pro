The Cisco Security Monitoring, Analysis and Response System (CS-MARS)
before 4.2.3 and Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) before
5.2(2.54) do not validate the SSL/TLS certificates or SSH public keys
when connecting to devices, which allows remote attackers to spoof
those devices to obtain sensitive information or generate incorrect
information.
