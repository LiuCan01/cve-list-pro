Fedora Commons before 2.2.1 does not properly handle certain
authentication requests involving Java Naming and Directory Interface
(JNDI), related to (1) a nonexistent account name in combination with
an empty password, which allows remote attackers to trigger a certain
"unexpected / strange response" from an LDAP server, and (2) a
reauthentication attempt that throws an exception, which allows remote
attackers to trigger use of a cached authentication decision.  NOTE:
authentication can be bypassed by using vector 1 followed by vector 2,
and possibly can be bypassed by using a single vector.
