Cross-zone scripting vulnerability in the DOM templates (domplates)
used by the console.log function in the Firebug extension before 1.03
for Mozilla Firefox allows remote attackers to bypass zone
restrictions, read arbitrary file:// URIs, or execute arbitrary code
in the browser chrome, as demonstrated via the runFile function,
related to lack of HTML escaping in the property name.
