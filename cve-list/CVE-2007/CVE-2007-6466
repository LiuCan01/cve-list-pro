Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in index.php in FreeWebshop
2.2.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1)
the prod parameter in a details action, (2) the cat parameter in a
browse list action, or (3) the group parameter in a categories
action.  NOTE: it was later reported that MOG - Web Shop
(MOG-WebShop), a product based on the same code, is also affected.
