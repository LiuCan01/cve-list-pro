JFFS2, as used on One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) build 542 and possibly
other Linux systems, when POSIX ACL support is enabled, does not
properly store permissions during (1) inode creation or (2) ACL
setting, which might allow local users to access restricted files or
directories after a remount of a filesystem, related to "legacy modes"
and an inconsistency between dentry permissions and inode permissions.
