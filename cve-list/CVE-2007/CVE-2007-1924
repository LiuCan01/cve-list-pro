** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in phpContact allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
include_path parameter to (1) contact_business.php or (2)
contact_person.php.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE and a reliable
third party, because include_path is initialized to a fixed value
before use.
