The kernel in Apple Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.4.10 does not reset the
current Mach Thread Port or Thread Exception Port when executing a
setuid program, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code by
creating the port before launching the setuid program, then writing to
the address space of the setuid process.
