Integer signedness error in the _zend_mm_alloc_int function in the
Zend Memory Manager in PHP 5.2.0 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a large emalloc request, related to an incorrect
signed long cast, as demonstrated via the HTTP SOAP client in PHP, and
via a call to msg_receive with the largest positive integer value of
maxsize.
