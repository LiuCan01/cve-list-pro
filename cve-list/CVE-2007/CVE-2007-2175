Apple QuickTime Java extensions (QTJava.dll), as used in Safari and
other browsers, and when Java is enabled, allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via parameters to the toQTPointer method in
quicktime.util.QTHandleRef, which can be used to modify arbitrary
memory when creating QTPointerRef objects, as demonstrated during the
"PWN 2 0WN" contest at CanSecWest 2007.
