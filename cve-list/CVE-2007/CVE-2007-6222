The CheckCustomerAccess function in functions.php in CRM-CTT
Interleave before 4.2.0 (formerly CRM-CTT) does not properly verify
user privileges, which allows remote authenticated users with the
LIMITTOCUSTOMERS privilege to bypass intended access restrictions and
edit non-active user settings.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
