F-Secure Anti-Virus for Windows Servers 7.0 64-bit edition allows
local users to bypass virus scanning by using the system32 directory
to store a crafted (1) archive or (2) packed executable.  NOTE: in many
environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries because any
process able to write to system32 could also shut off F-Secure
Anti-Virus.
