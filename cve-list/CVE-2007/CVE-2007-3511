The focus handling for the onkeydown event in Mozilla Firefox
1.5.0.12, 2.0.0.4 and other versions before 2.0.0.8, and SeaMonkey
before 1.1.5 allows remote attackers to change field focus and copy
keystrokes via the "for" attribute in a label, which bypasses the
focus prevention, as demonstrated by changing focus from a textarea to
a file upload field.
