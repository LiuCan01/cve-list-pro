AhnLab Antivirus 3 Internet Security 2008 Platinum appends data to a
filename string at a location indicated by the "Filename length" field
in a ZIP header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (machine crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a ZIP
file in which this field's value is larger than the actual number of
bytes in the filename.
