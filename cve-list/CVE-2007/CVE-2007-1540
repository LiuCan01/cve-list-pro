Directory traversal vulnerability in am.pl in (1) SQL-Ledger 2.6.27
and earlier, and (2) LedgerSMB before 1.2.0, allows remote attackers
to run arbitrary executables and bypass authentication via a .. (dot
dot) sequence and trailing NULL (%00) in the login parameter.  NOTE:
this issue was reportedly addressed in SQL-Ledger 2.6.27, however
third-party researchers claim that the file is still executed even
though an error is generated.
