The connect method in lib/net/http.rb in the (1) Net::HTTP and (2)
Net::HTTPS libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 does not verify that the
commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name
in an HTTPS request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed
web site.
