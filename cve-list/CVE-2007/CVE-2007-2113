SQL injection vulnerability in the Upgrade/Downgrade component
(DBMS_UPGRADE_INTERNAL) for Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 allows remote
authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unknown
vectors, aka DB07.  NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed
reliable claims that DB07 is actually for multiple issues.
