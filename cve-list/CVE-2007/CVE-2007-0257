** DISPUTED **

Unspecified vulnerability in the expand_stack function in grsecurity
PaX allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
NOTE: the grsecurity developer has disputed this issue, stating that
"the function they claim the vulnerability to be in is a trivial
function, which can, and has been, easily checked for any supposed
vulnerabilities."  The developer also cites a past disclosure that was
not proven.  As of 20070120, the original researcher has released
demonstration code.
