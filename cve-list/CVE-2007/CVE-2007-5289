HP Mercury Quality Center (QC) 9.2 and earlier, and possibly
TestDirector, relies on cached client-side scripts to implement
"workflow" and decisions about the "capability" of a user, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted use of
the Open Test Architecture (OTA) API, as demonstrated by modifying (1)
common.tds, (2) defects.tds, (3) manrun.tds, (4) req.tds, (5)
testlab.tds, or (6) testplan.tds in %tmp%TD_80, and then setting the
file's properties to read-only.
