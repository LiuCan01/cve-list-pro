The wddx_deserialize function in wddx.c 1.119.2.10.2.12 and
1.119.2.10.2.13 in PHP 5, as modified in CVS on 20070224 and fixed on
20070304, calls strlcpy where strlcat was intended and uses improper
arguments, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a WDDX packet with a malformed overlap of a STRING
element, which triggers a buffer overflow.
