The administrative interface (aka DkService.exe) in Diskeeper 9
Professional, 2007 Pro Premier, and probably other versions exposes a
memory comparison function via RPC over TCP, which allows remote
attackers to (1) obtain sensitive information (process memory
contents), as demonstrated by an attack that obtains module base
addresses to defeat Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR); or (2)
cause a denial of service (application crash) via an out-of-bounds
address.
