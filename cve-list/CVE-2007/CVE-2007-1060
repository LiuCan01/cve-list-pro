Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Interspire
SendStudio 2004.14 and earlier, when register_globals and
allow_fopenurl are enabled, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the ROOTDIR parameter to (1)
createemails.inc.php and (2) send_emails.inc.php in /admin/includes/.
