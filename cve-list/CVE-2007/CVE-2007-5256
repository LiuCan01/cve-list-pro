Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in FSD 2.052 d9 and earlier, and
FSFDT FSD 3.000 d9 and earlier, allow (1) remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long HELP command on TCP port 3010 to the
sysuser::exechelp function in sysuser.cc and (2) remote authenticated
users to execute arbitrary code via long commands on TCP port 6809 to
the servinterface::sendmulticast function in servinterface.cc, as
demonstrated by a PIcallsign command.
