Stack-based buffer overflow in the logging function in the Unreal
engine, possibly 2003 and 2004, as used in the internal web server,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) via a request for a long .gif filename in the images/
directory, related to conversion from Unicode to ASCII.
