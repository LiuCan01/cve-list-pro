Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in l123sr.dll in Autonomy
(formerly Verity) KeyView SDK, as used by IBM Lotus Notes 5.x through
8.x, allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via the (1) Length and (2) Value fields for certain Types in a Lotus
1-2-3 (.123) file in the Worksheet File (WKS) format, as demonstrated
by a file with a crafted SRANGE record, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2007-5909.
