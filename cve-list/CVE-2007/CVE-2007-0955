The NTLM_UnPack_Type3 function in MENTLM.dll in MailEnable
Professional 2.35 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (application crash) via certain base64-encoded data
following an AUTHENTICATE NTLM command to the imap port (143/tcp),
which results in an out-of-bounds read.
