Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Jupiter CMS 1.1.5 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the Client-IP
HTTP header and certain other HTTP headers, which set the ip variable
that is used in SQL queries performed by index.php and certain other
PHP scripts.  NOTE: the attack vector might involve _SERVER.
