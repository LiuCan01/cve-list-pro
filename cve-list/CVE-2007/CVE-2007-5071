Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in upload_img_cgi.php in Simple PHP
Blog before 0.5.1 allows remote attackers to upload dangerous files
and execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by a filename ending in
.php. or a .htaccess file, a different vector than CVE-2005-2733.
NOTE: the vulnerability was also present in a 0.5.1 download available
in the early morning of 20070923.  NOTE: the original 20070920
disclosure provided an incorrect filename, img_upload_cgi.php.
