The default configuration of Centre for Speech Technology Research
(CSTR) Festival 1.95 beta (aka 2.0 beta) on Gentoo Linux, SUSE Linux,
and possibly other distributions, is run locally with elevated
privileges without requiring authentication, which allows local and
remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the local daemon on
port 1314, a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-0956.  NOTE: this
issue is local in some environments, but remote on others.
