Multiple buffer overflows in the DB2 JDBC Applet Server (DB2JDS)
service in IBM DB2 9.x and earlier allow remote attackers to (1)
execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet to the DB2JDS service on
tcp/6789; and cause a denial of service via (2) an invalid LANG
parameter or (2) a long packet that generates a "MemTree overflow."
