Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/36407

Tor before 0.1.2.16, when ControlPort is enabled, does not properly
restrict commands to localhost port 9051, which allows remote
attackers to modify the torrc configuration file, compromise
anonymity, and have other unspecified impact via HTTP POST data
containing commands without valid authentication, as demonstrated by
an HTML form (1) hosted on a web site or (2) injected by a Tor exit
node.
