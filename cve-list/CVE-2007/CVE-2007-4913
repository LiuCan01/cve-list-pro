2.3.1 up to 20070912 allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary
script files with crafted image filenames to uploads/, where they are
saved with a .txt extension and are not executable.  NOTE: there are
limited usage scenarios under which this would be a vulnerability, but
it is being tracked by CVE since the vendor has stated it is
security-relevant.
