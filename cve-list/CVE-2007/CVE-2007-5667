NWFILTER.SYS in Novell Client 4.91 SP 1 through SP 4 for Windows 2000,
XP, and Server 2003 makes the .nwfilter device available for
arbitrary user-mode input via METHOD_NEITHER IOCTLs, which allows
local users to gain privileges by passing a kernel address as an
argument and overwriting kernel memory locations.
