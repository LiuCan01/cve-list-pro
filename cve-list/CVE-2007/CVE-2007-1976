** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in the Virii Info
1.10 and earlier module for Xoops allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the xoopsConfig[root_path] parameter.
NOTE: the issue has been disputed by a reliable third party, stating
that the application's checkSuperglobals function defends against the
attack.
