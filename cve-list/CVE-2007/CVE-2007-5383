The Thomson/Alcatel SpeedTouch 7G router, as used for the BT Home Hub
6.2.6.B and earlier, allows remote attackers on an intranet to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access via vectors including a
'/' (slash) character at the end of the PATH_INFO to cgi/b, aka
"double-slash auth bypass." NOTE: remote attackers outside the
intranet can exploit this by leveraging a separate CSRF
vulnerability. NOTE: SpeedTouch 780 might also be affected by some of
these issues.
