Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in index.php in phpMyAdmin 2.8.0
through 2.9.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks by injecting arbitrary JavaScript or HTML in a (1) db or
(2) table parameter value followed by an uppercase </SCRIPT> end tag,
which bypasses the protection against lowercase </script>.
