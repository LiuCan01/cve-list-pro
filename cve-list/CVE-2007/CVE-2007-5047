Norton Internet Security 2008 15.0.0.60 does not properly validate
certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function
handlers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly gain privileges via the NtOpenSection kernel SSDT
hook.  NOTE: the NtCreateMutant and NtOpenEvent function hooks are
already covered by CVE-2007-1793.
