Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an mt import in
wp-admin/admin.php in WordPress 2.1.2 allows remote authenticated
administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the demo
parameter.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the
details are obtained solely from third party information. NOTE:
another researcher disputes this issue, stating that this is
legitimate functionality for administrators.  However, it has been
patched by at least one vendor.
