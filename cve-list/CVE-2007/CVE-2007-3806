The glob function in PHP 5.2.3 allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via an
invalid value of the flags parameter, probably related to memory
corruption or an invalid read on win32 platforms, and possibly related
to lack of initialization for a glob structure.
