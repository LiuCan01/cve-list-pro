Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in XCMS 1.82
and earlier allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a ..
(dot dot) in (1) the s parameter to the admin page or (2) the pg
parameter to an arbitrary module, as demonstrated by reading a
password hash in a .dtb file under dati/membri/ or by executing
embedded PHP code in images under uploads/avatar/.
