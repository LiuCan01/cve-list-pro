** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
Drupal 7.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of arbitrary users for requests that end a session via
the user/logout URI.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of
this issue, by considering the "security benefit against platform
complexity and performance impact" and concluding that a change to the
logout behavior is not planned because "for most sites it is not worth
the trade-off."
