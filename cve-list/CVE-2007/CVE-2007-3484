** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search.php in Google
Custom Search Engine allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the q parameter.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by
the Google Security Team, who states that "Google does not provide the
'search.php' script referenced.  When a user creates a custom search
engine, we provide them with a block of javascript to include on their
site.  Some users write additional code around this block of
javascript to further customize their website."
