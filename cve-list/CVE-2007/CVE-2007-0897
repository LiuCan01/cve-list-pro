Clam AntiVirus ClamAV before 0.90 does not close open file descriptors under
certain conditions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (file descriptor consumption and failed scans) via CAB archives with
a cabinet header record length of zero, which causes a function to return
without closing a file descriptor.
