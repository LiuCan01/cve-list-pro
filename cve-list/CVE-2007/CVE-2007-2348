mirror --script in lftp before 3.5.9 does not properly quote shell
metacharacters, which might allow remote user-assisted attackers to
execute shell commands via a malicious script.  NOTE: it is not clear
whether this issue crosses security boundaries, since the script
already supports commands such as "get" which could overwrite
executable files.
