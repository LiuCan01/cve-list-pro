Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Microsoft Internet
Explorer 6.0 and 7 allows user-assisted remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML in the local zone via a URI, when the
document at the associated URL is saved to a local file, which then
contains the URI string along with the document's original content.
