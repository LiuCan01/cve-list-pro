The embedded LDAP server in BEA WebLogic Express and WebLogic Server
7.0 through SP6, 8.1 through SP5, 9.0, and 9.1, when in certain
configurations, does not limit or audit failed authentication
attempts, which allows remote attackers to more easily conduct
brute-force attacks against the administrator password, or flood the
server with login attempts and cause a denial of service.
