TorrentTrader 1.07 and earlier sets insecure permissions for files in
the root directory, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code by modifying (1) disclaimer.txt, (2) sponsors.txt, and (3)
banners.txt, which are used in an include call.  NOTE: there might be
local attack vectors that extend to other files.
