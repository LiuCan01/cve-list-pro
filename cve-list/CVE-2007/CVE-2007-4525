** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in inc-calcul.php3 in SPIP
1.7.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL
in the squelette_cache parameter, a different vector than
CVE-2006-1702. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third party
researchers, stating that the squelette_cache variable is initialized
before use, and is only used within the scope of a function.
