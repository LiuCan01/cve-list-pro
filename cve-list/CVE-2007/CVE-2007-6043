The CryptGenRandom function in Microsoft Windows 2000 generates
predictable values, which makes it easier for context-dependent
attackers to reduce the effectiveness of cryptographic mechanisms, as
demonstrated by attacks on (1) forward security and (2) backward
security, related to use of eight instances of the RC4 cipher, and
possibly a related issue to CVE-2007-3898.
