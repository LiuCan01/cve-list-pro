Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Spooler service
(nwspool.dll) in Novell Client 4.91 SP2 through SP4 for Windows allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain long arguments
to the (1) RpcAddPrinterDriver, (2) RpcGetPrinterDriverDirectory, and
other unspecified RPC requests, aka Novell bug 300870, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2006-5854.
