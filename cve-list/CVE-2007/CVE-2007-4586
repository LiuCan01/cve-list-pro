Multiple buffer overflows in php_iisfunc.dll in the iisfunc extension
for PHP 5.2.0 and earlier allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code, probably during Unicode conversion, as demonstrated by
a long string in the first argument to the iis_getservicestate
function, related to the ServiceId argument to the (1) fnStartService,
(2) fnGetServiceState, (3) fnStopService, and possibly other
functions.
