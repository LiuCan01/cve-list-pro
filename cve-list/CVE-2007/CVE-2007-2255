Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Download-Engine
1.4.3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL
in the (1) eng_dir parameter to addmember.php, (2) lang_path parameter
to admin/enginelib/class.phpmailer.php, and the (3) spaw_root
parameter to admin/includes/spaw/dialogs/colorpicker.php, different
vectors than CVE-2006-5291 and CVE-2006-5459.  NOTE: vector 3 might be
an issue in SPAW.
