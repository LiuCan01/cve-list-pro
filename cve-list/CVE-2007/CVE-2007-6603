Hot or Not Clone has insufficient access control for producing and
reading database backups, which allows remote attackers to obtain the
administrator username and password via a direct request to
control/backup/backup.php, which generates a backup/dump/backup.sql
file that can be downloaded via a direct request to
control/downloadfile.php.
