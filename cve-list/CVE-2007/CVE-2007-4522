Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Ripe Website Manager 0.8.9
and earlier allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via one or more of the following vectors: the (1) id
parameter to (a) pages/delete_page.php, (b)
navigation/delete_menu.php, and (c) navigation/delete_item.php in
admin/; the (2) menu_id, (3) name, (3) page_id, and (4) url parameters
in (d) admin/navigation/do_new_item.php; the (5) new_menuname
parameter in (e) admin/navigation/do_new_nav.php; and (6) area1, name,
and url parameters to (f) admin/pages/do_new_page.php.  NOTE: some
vectors might be reachable through the url and name parameters to (g)
admin/navigation/new_nav_item.php.  NOTE: the original disclosure does
not precisely state which vectors are associated with SQL injection
versus XSS.
