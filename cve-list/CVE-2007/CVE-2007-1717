The mail function in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1
truncates e-mail messages at the first ASCIIZ ('0') byte, which might
allow context-dependent attackers to prevent intended information from
being delivered in e-mail messages.  NOTE: this issue might be
security-relevant in cases when the trailing contents of e-mail
messages are important, such as logging information or if the message
is expected to be well-formed.
