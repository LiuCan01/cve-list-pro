** DISPUTED **

PatrolAgent.exe in BMC Performance Manager does not require
authentication for requests to modify configuration files, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a request on TCP
port 3181 for modification of the masterAgentName and
masterAgentStartLine SNMP parameters.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this
vulnerability, stating that it does not exist when the system is
properly configured.
