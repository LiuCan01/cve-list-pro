Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Nuked Klan 1.7 and earlier
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
javascript: URI in a getURL statement in a .swf file, as demonstrated
by "Remote Cookie Disclosure."  NOTE: it could be argued that this is
an issue in Shockwave instead of Nuked Klan.
