Multiple buffer overflows in MyDNS 1.1.0 allow remote attackers to (1)
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a certain update, which triggers a heap-based
buffer overflow in update.c; and (2) cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) via unspecified vectors that trigger an off-by-one stack-based
buffer overflow in update.c.
