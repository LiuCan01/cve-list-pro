initscripts in rPath Linux 1 sets insecure permissions for the
/var/log/btmp file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
information regarding authentication attempts.  NOTE: because sshd
detects the insecure permissions and does not log certain events, this
also prevents sshd from logging failed authentication attempts by
remote attackers.
