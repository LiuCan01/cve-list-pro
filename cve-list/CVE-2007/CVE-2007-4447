Multiple buffer overflows in the client in Toribash 2.71 and earlier
allow remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary code via a long game
command in a replay (.rpl) file and (2) cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a long SAY command that omits a required LF
character; and allow remote Toribash servers to execute arbitrary code
via (3) a long game command and (4) a long SAY command that omits a
required LF character.
