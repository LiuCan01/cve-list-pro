CMS Made Simple 1.1.3.1 does not check the permissions assigned to
users in some situations, which allows remote authenticated users to
perform some administrative actions, as demonstrated by (1) adding a
user via a direct request to admin/adduser.php and (2) reading the
admin log via an "admin/adminlog.php?page=1" request.
