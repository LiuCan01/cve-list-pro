The management service in IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS
Deployment before 5.1 Fix Pack 2 does not properly handle
multipart/form-data in HTTP POST requests, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(daemon crash) via crafted POST requests to port 8080/tcp or 443/tcp.
