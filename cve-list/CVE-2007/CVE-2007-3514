Cross-domain vulnerability in Apple Safari for Windows 3.0.2 allows
remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and access
restricted information from other domains via JavaScript that
overwrites the document variable and statically sets the
document.domain attribute to a file:// location, a different vector
than CVE-2007-3482.
