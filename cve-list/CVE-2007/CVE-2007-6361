Gekko 0.8.2 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web
root with possibly insufficient access control, which might allow
remote attackers to read certain files under temp/, as demonstrated by
a log file that records the titles of blog entries.  NOTE: access to
temp/ is blocked by .htaccess in most deployments that use Apache HTTP
Server.
