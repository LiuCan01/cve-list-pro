The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk Open 1.2.x before
1.2.23, 1.4.x before 1.4.9, and Asterisk Appliance Developer Kit
before 0.6.0, when configured to allow unauthenticated calls, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion)
via a flood of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake, which
causes an ast_channel to be allocated but not released.
