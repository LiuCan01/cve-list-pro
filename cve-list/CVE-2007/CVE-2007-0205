Directory traversal vulnerability in admin/skins.php for @lex
Guestbook 4.0.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to create files in
arbitrary directories via ".." sequences in the (1) aj_skin and (2)
skin_edit parameters.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for file inclusion
by creating a skin file in the lang directory, then referencing that
file via the lang parameter to index.php, which passes a sanity check
in livre_include.php.
