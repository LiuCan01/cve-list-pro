Send ICMP Nasty Garbage (sing) on Debian GNU/Linux allows local users
to append to arbitrary files and gain privileges via the -L (output
log file) option.  NOTE: this issue is only a vulnerability in limited
environments, since sing is not installed setuid, and the
administrator would need to override a non-setuid default during
installation.
