The Net Direct client for Linux before 6.0.5 in Nortel Application
Switch 2424, VPN 3050 and 3070, and SSL VPN Module 1000 extracts and
executes files with insecure permissions, which allows local users to
exploit a race condition to replace a world-writable file in
/tmp/NetClient and cause another user to execute arbitrary code when
attempting to execute this client, as demonstrated by replacing
/tmp/NetClient/client.
