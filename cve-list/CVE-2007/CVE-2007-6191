Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Armin Burger
p.mapper 3.2.0 beta3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the _SESSION[PM_INCPHP] parameter to (1)
incphp/globals.php or (2) plugins/export/mc_table.php.  NOTE: it could
be argued that this vulnerability is caused by a problem in PHP and
the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be
treated as a vulnerability in p.mapper.
