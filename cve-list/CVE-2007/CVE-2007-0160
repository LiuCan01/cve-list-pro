Stack-based buffer overflow in the LiveJournal support
(hooks/ljhook.cc) in CenterICQ 4.9.11 through 4.21.0, when using
unofficial LiveJournal servers, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by
adding the victim as a friend and using long (1) username and (2) real
name strings.
