Stack-based buffer overflow in the animated cursor code in Microsoft
Windows 2000 SP4 through Vista allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (persistent reboot) via a
large length value in the second (or later) anih block of a RIFF .ANI,
cur, or .ico file, which results in memory corruption when processing
cursors, animated cursors, and icons, a variant of CVE-2005-0416, as
originally demonstrated using Internet Explorer 6 and 7. NOTE: this
might be a duplicate of CVE-2007-1765; if so, then CVE-2007-0038
should be preferred.
