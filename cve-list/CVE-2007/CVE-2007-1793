SPBBCDrv.sys in Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2006 9.1.0.33 and
9.1.1.7 does not validate certain arguments before being passed to
hooked SSDT function handlers, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted arguments to the (1) NtCreateMutant and (2) NtOpenEvent
functions.  NOTE: it was later reported that Norton Internet Security
2008 15.0.0.60, and possibly other versions back to 2006, are also
affected.
