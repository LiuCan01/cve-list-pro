Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in IDE Group DVD
Rental System (DRS) 5.1 before 20070801 allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: it
is not clear whether IDE Group updates all DRS installations in its
role as an application service provider. If so, then this issue should
not be included in CVE.
