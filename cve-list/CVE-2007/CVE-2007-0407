Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Operation/User.pm in Plain
Black WebGUI before 7.3.5 (beta) allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter during
anonymous registration, a different vector than CVE-2007-0308.  NOTE:
it is possible that a separate "WikiPage titles" issue was also fixed.
