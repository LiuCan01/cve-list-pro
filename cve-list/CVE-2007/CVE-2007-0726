The SSH key generation process in OpenSSH in Apple Mac OS X 10.3.9 and
10.4 through 10.4.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service by connecting to the server before SSH has finished creating
keys, which causes the keys to be regenerated and can break trust
relationships that were based on the original keys.
