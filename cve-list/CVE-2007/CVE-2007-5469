** DISPUTED **

OpenSER 1.2.2 does not verify the Digest authentication header URI
against the Request URI in SIP messages, which allows remote attackers
to use sniffed Digest authentication credentials to call arbitrary
telephone numbers or spoof caller ID (aka "toll fraud and
authentication forward attack").  NOTE: Debian disputes this issue,
stating that "having the two URIs mismatch is allowed by the standard
and happens in some setups for valid reasons."
