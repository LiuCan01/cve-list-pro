slapo-pcache (overlays/pcache.c) in slapd in OpenLDAP before 2.3.39,
when running as a proxy-caching server, allocates memory using a
malloc variant instead of calloc, which prevents an array from being
initialized properly and might allow attackers to cause a denial of
service (segmentation fault) via unknown vectors that prevent the
array from being null terminated.
