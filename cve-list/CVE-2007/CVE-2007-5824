webserver.c in mt-dappd in Firefly Media Server 0.2.4 and earlier
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference
and daemon crash) via a stats method action to /xml-rpc with (1) an
empty Authorization header line, which triggers a crash in the
ws_decodepassword function; or (2) a header line without a ':'
character, which triggers a crash in the ws_getheaders function.
