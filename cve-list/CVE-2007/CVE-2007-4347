Multiple integer overflows in the Job Engine (bengine.exe) service in
Symantec Backup Exec for Windows Servers (BEWS) 11d build 11.0.7170
and 11.0.6.6235 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(CPU and memory consumption) via a crafted packet to port 5633/tcp,
which triggers an infinite loop.
