Directory traversal vulnerability in language.php in VerliAdmin 0.3
and earlier, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote
attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot
dot) in the lang cookie, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences
into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by
language.php.
