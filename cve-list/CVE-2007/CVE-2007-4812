Buffer overflow in Apple Safari 3.0.3 522.15.5, and other versions
before Beta Update 3.0.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) and possibly have other unspecified impact by setting
document.location.hash to a long string.  NOTE: the crash might
actually occur in the alert method.
