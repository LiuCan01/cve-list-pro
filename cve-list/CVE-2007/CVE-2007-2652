Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Free-SA before 1.2.2 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors
involving certain (1) sprintf and (2) vsprintf calls in (a) r_index.c,
(b) r_reports.c, (c) r_topsites.c, (d) r_topuser.c, (e) r_typical.c,
(f) r_userdatetime.c, and (g) r_users.c in reports/; and (h) w_fs.c,
(i) w_internal.c, and (j) w_log_operations.c in work/, probably
related to buffer overflows.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained
from third party information.
