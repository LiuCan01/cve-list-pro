Mutt 1.5.13 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument
when invoking GnuPG, which prevents Mutt from visually distinguishing
between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple
components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a
message without detection.
