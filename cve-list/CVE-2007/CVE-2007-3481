** DISPUTED **

Cross-domain vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7
allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and access
restricted information from other domains via JavaScript that
overwrites the document variable and statically sets the
document.domain attribute.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by
other researchers, citing a variable scoping issue and information
about the semantics of document.domain.
