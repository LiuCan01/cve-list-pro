** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in pcltrace.lib.php in the
PclTar module in Vincent Blavet PhpConcept Library, as used in CJG
EXPLORER PRO 3.3 and earlier and probably other products, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
g_pcltar_lib_dir parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue since there
is no include statement in pcltrace.lib.php.  NOTE: the pcltar.lib.php
vector is already covered by CVE-2007-2199.
