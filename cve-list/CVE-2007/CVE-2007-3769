Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mirrored server
management interface in SurgeFTP 2.3a1 allows user-assisted, remote
FTP servers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a malformed
response without a status code, which is reflected to the user in the
resulting error message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for root access
via a sequence of steps involving web script that creates a new FTP
user account.
