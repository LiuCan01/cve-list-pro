** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in payments/ideal_process.php in the
iDEAL transaction handler in ViArt Shopping Cart allows remote
attackers to have an unknown impact via directory traversal sequences
in the filename parameter to the createCertFingerprint function.  NOTE:
this issue is disputed by CVE because PHP encounters a fatal
function-call error on a direct request for
payments/ideal_process.php.
