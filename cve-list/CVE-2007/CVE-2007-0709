cmdmon.sys in Comodo Firewall Pro (formerly Comodo Personal Firewall)
2.4.16.174 and earlier does not validate arguments that originate in
user mode for the (1) NtCreateSection, (2) NtOpenProcess, (3)
NtOpenSection, (4) NtOpenThread, and (5) NtSetValueKey hooked SSDT
functions, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(system crash) and possibly gain privileges via invalid arguments.
