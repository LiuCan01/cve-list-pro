Integer signedness error in the SET_VALUE function in rarvm.cpp in
unrar 3.70 beta 3, as used in products including WinRAR and RAR for OS
X, allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via a crafted RAR archive that causes a negative signed number
to be cast to a large unsigned number.
