Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Ripe Website
Manager 0.8.9 and earlier allow remote authenticated users to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via one or more of the following vectors:
the (1) id parameter to (a) pages/delete_page.php, (b)
navigation/delete_menu.php, and (c) navigation/delete_item.php in
admin/; the (2) menu_id, (3) name, (3) page_id, and (4) url parameters
in (d) admin/navigation/do_new_item.php; the (5) new_menuname
parameter in (e) admin/navigation/do_new_nav.php; and (6) area1, name,
and url parameters to (f) admin/pages/do_new_page.php, probably
involving the Title or textarea field as reachable through
admin/pages/new_page.php.  NOTE: the original disclosure does not
precisely state which vectors are associated with SQL injection versus
XSS.
