The DHCP relay agent in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and
PIX 7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (dropped
packets) via a DHCPREQUEST or DHCPINFORM message that causes multiple
DHCPACK messages to be sent from DHCP servers to the agent, which
consumes the memory allocated for a local buffer.  NOTE: this issue
only occurs when multiple DHCP servers are used.
