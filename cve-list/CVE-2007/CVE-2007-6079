Directory traversal vulnerability in include/common.php in bcoos
1.0.10 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local
files via a .. (dot dot) in the xoopsOption[pagetype] parameter to the
default URI for modules/news/.  NOTE: this can be leveraged by using
legitimate product functionality to upload a file that contains the
code, then including that file.
