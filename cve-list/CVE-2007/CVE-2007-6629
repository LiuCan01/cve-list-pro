Interpretation conflict in LScube Feng 0.1.15 and earlier allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and
daemon crash) via a User-Agent header line that contains a
carriage-return character, which is considered a line delimiter when
the header is split into individual lines, but not when log_user_agent
in RTSP_utils.c parses the content of the User-Agent line.
