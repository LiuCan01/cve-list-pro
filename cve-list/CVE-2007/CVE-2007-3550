** DISPUTED **

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and 7.0 allows remote attackers to
fill Zones with arbitrary domains using certain metacharacters such as
wildcards via JavaScript, which results in a denial of service
(website suppression and resource consumption), aka "Internet Explorer
Zone Domain Specification Dos and Page Suppressing".  NOTE: this issue
has been disputed by a third party, who states that the zone settings
cannot be manipulated.
