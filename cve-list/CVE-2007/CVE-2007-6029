Unspecified vulnerability in ClamAV 0.91.1 and 0.91.2 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted e-mail message.
NOTE: this information is based upon a vague advisory by a
vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate
with vendors or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned
for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to
determine.
