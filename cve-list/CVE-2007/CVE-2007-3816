** DISPUTED **

JWIG might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (service degradation) via loops of references to external
templates.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by multiple third
parties who state that only the application developer can trigger the
issue, so no privilege boundaries are crossed.  However, it seems
possible that this is a vulnerability class to which an JWIG
application may be vulnerable if template contents can be influenced,
but this would be an issue in the application itself, not JWIG.
