Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in 4print.asp in
WmsCMS 2.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the (1) sbl, (2) sbr, or (3) search parameter.
NOTE: the original disclosure claims the pageid parameter in index.php
is affected, but this is incorrect.
