Multiple integer overflows in PHP 4 before 4.4.8, and PHP 5 before
5.2.4, allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory
contents) or cause a denial of service (thread crash) via a large len
value to the (1) strspn or (2) strcspn function, which triggers an
out-of-bounds read.  NOTE: this affects different product versions
than CVE-2007-3996.
