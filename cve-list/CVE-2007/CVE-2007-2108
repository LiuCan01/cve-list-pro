Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component in Oracle
Database 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.8, 10.1.0.5, and 10.2.0.2 on Windows allows
remote attackers to have an unknown impact, aka DB01.  NOTE: as of
20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that this issue
occurs because the NTLM SSPI AcceptSecurityContext function grants
privileges based on the username provided even though all users are
authenticated as Guest, which allows remote attackers to gain
privileges.
