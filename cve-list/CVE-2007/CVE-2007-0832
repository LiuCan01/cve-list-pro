VMware Workstation 5.5.3 34685 does not immediately change the
availability of a shared clipboard when the "Enable copy and paste to
and from this virtual machine" checkbox is changed, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information or conduct certain attacks that
are facilitated by weaker isolation between the host and guest
operating systems.
