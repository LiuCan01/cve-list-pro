ideal_process.php in the iDEAL payment module in ViArt Shop 3.3 beta
and earlier might allow remote attackers to obtain the pathname for
certificate and key files via an "iDEAL transaction", possibly
involving fopen error messages for nonexistent files, a different
issue than CVE-2007-5364.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for reading
certificate or key files if an installation places these files under
the web document root.
