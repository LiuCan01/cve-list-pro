WordPress 2.1.1, as downloaded from some official distribution sites
during February and March 2007, contains an externally introduced
backdoor that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
via (1) an eval injection vulnerability in the ix parameter to
wp-includes/feed.php, and (2) an untrusted passthru call in the iz
parameter to wp-includes/theme.php.
