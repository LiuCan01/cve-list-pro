Directory traversal vulnerability in sesskglogadmin.php in KGB 1.9 and
earlier allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local
files via a .. (dot dot) in the skinnn parameter, as demonstrated by
invoking kg.php with a postek parameter containing PHP code, which is
injected into a file in the kg directory, and then included by
sesskglogadmin.php.
