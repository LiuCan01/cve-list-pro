The Bonjour functionality in mDNSResponder, iChat 3.1.6, and
InstantMessage framework 428 in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8 does not check
for duplicate entries when adding newly discovered available contacts,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disrupted
communication) via a flood of duplicate _presence._tcp mDNS queries.
