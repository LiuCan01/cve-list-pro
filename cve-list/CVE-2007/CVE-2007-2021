Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Pineapple
Technologies Lore 1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the (1) lang_path parameter to
third_party/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php or the (2)
get_plugin_file_path parameter to
third_party/smarty/libs/plugins/function.html_checkboxes.php.  NOTE:
the affected files might be from other software packages, so this
might not be a vulnerability in Lore itself.  NOTE: (1) might be the
same issue as CVE-2006-5734.4.
