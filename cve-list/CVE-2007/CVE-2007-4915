The Intersil isl3893 extensions for Boa 0.93.15, as used on the
FreeLan RO80211G-AP and other devices, do not prevent stack writes
from entering memory locations used for string constants, which allows
remote attackers to change the admin password stored in memory via a
long username in an HTTP Basic Authentication request.
