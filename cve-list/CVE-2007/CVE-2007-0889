Kiwi CatTools before 3.2.0 beta uses weak encryption ("reversible
encoding") for passwords, account names, and IP addresses in
kiwidb-cattools.kdb, which might allow local users to gain sensitive
information by decrypting the file.  NOTE: this issue could be
leveraged with a directory traversal vulnerability for a remote attack
vector.
