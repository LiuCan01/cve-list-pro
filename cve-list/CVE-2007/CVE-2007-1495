The DeviceSymEvent driver in Symantec Norton Personal Firewall 2006
9.1.1.7, and possibly other products using symevent.sys 12.0.0.20,
allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via
invalid data, as demonstrated by calling DeviceIoControl to send the
data, a reintroduction of CVE-2006-4855.
