Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in wolioCMS allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the id parameter
to member.php in a page action, related to a SELECT statement in
common.php; and the (2) loginid parameter (uid variable), and possibly
the (3) pwd parameter, to admin/index.php.
