Apple iTunes 7.0.2 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (application crash) via a crafted XML list of radio
stations, which results in memory corruption.  NOTE: iTunes retrieves
the XML document from a static URL, which requires an attacker to
perform DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks for exploitation.
