Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in adclick.php in (a) Openads
(phpAdsNew) 2.0.11 and earlier and (b) Openads for PostgreSQL
(phpPgAds) 2.0.11 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via
CRLF sequences in (1) the dest parameter and (2) the Referer HTTP
header.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
