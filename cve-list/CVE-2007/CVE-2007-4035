** DISPUTED **

Guidance Software EnCase does not properly handle (1) certain
malformed MBR partition tables with many entries, which allows remote
attackers to prevent logical collection of a disk image; (2) NTFS
filesystems with directory loops, which allows remote attackers to
prevent examination of certain directory contents; and (3) certain
other malformed NTFS filesystems, which allows remote attackers to
prevent examination of corrupted records. NOTE: the vendor disputes
the significance of these issues, because physical collection can be
used instead, because the vendor believes that relevant attackers
typically do not corrupt an MBR or a filesystem, and because detection
of a loop is valuable on its own.
