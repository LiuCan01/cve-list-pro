contrib/mx_glance_sdesc.php in the mx_glance 2.3.3 module for mxBB
places a critical security check within a comment because of a missing
comment delimiter, which allows remote attackers to conduct remote
file inclusion attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mx_root_path parameter.  NOTE: some sources incorrectly state that
phpbb_root_path is the affected parameter.
