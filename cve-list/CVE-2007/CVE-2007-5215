Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Jacob Hinkle
GodSend 0.6 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the SCRIPT_DIR parameter to (1) gtk/main.inc.php or (2)
cmdline.inc.php.  NOTE: vector 2 is disputed by CVE because it is
contained in unaccessible code, requiring that two undefined constants
be equal.
