The Database Link library (dblink) in PostgreSQL 8.1 implements
functions via CREATE statements that map to arbitrary libraries based
on the C programming language, which allows remote authenticated
superusers to map and execute a function from any library, as
demonstrated by using the system function in libc.so.6 to gain shell
access.
