Direct static code injection vulnerability in
dirsys/modules/config/post.php in JBC Explorer 7.20 RC1 and earlier
allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary PHP
code via the DEBUG parameter, which can be executed by accessing
config.inc.php.  NOTE: this can be exploited by unauthenticated remote
attackers by leveraging CVE-2007-5913.
