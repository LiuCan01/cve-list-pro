Multiple buffer overflows in ACD products allow user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long section string in a (1)
XBM or (2) XPM file to (a) ID_X.apl or (b) IDE_ACDStd.apl.  NOTE: the
PSP and LHA vectors are already covered by CVE-2007-4344 and
CVE-2007-6007.  NOTE: these might be integer overflows rather than
buffer overflows.
