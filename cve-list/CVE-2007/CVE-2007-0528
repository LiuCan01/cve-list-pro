The admin web console implemented by the Centrality Communications
(aka Aredfox) PA168 chipset and firmware 1.54 and earlier, as provided
by various IP phones, does not require passwords or authentication
tokens when using HTTP, which allows remote attackers to connect to
existing superuser sessions and obtain sensitive information
(passwords and configuration data).
