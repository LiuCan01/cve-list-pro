VMware Workstation 5.5.3 build 34685 does not provide per-user
restrictions on certain privileged actions, which allows local users
to perform restricted operations such as changing system time,
accessing hardware components, and stopping the "VMware tools service"
service. NOTE: exploitation is simplified via (1) weak file
permissions (Users = Read & Execute) for %PROGRAMFILES%VMware; and
weak registry key permissions (access by Users) for (2) vmmouse, (3)
vmscsi, (4) VMTools, (5) vmx_svga, and (6) vmxnet in
HKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServices; which allows local users to
perform various privileged actions outside of the guest OS by
executing certain files under %PROGRAMFILES%VMwareVMware Tools, as
demonstrated by (a) VMControlPanel.cpl and (b) vmwareservice.exe.
