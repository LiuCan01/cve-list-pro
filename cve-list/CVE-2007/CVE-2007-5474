The driver for the Linksys WRT350N Wi-Fi access point with firmware
2.00.17 on the Atheros AR5416-AC1E chipset does not properly parse the
Atheros vendor-specific information element in an association request,
which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
(device reboot or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an
Atheros information element with an invalid length, as demonstrated by
an element that is too long.
