I Hear U (IHU) 0.5.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause (1)
a denial of service (infinite loop) via a packet that contains zero in
the size field in its header, which is improperly handled by the
Receiver::processPacket function; and (2) a denial of service (daemon
crash) via an (a) IHU_INFO_INIT or a (b) IHU_INFO_RING packet that
does not specify the mode, which is improperly handled by the
Player::ring function in Player.cpp.
