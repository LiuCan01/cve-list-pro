The PMA_ArrayWalkRecursive function in libraries/common.lib.php in
phpMyAdmin before 2.10.0.2 does not limit recursion on arrays provided
by users, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
of service (web server crash) via an array with many dimensions.  NOTE:
it could be argued that this vulnerability is caused by a problem in
PHP (CVE-2006-1549) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then
this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin.
