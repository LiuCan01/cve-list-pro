Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpslideshow.php in
PHPSlideShow 0.9.9.2, and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the directory parameter.
NOTE: this issue was originally reported for toonchapter8.php, but
this is probably a site-specific name, since the PHPSlideShow
distribution does not contain that file.
