** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Guestbook Script
1.9 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the script_root parameter to (1) delete.php, (2) edit.php, or (3)
inc/common.inc.php; or (4) database.php, (5) entries.php, (6)
index.php, (7) logout.php, or (8) settings.php in admin/.  NOTE: a
third party disputes this vulnerability, noting that these scripts
defend against direct requests.
