The process scheduler in the Microsoft Windows XP kernel does not make
use of the process statistics kept by the kernel, performs scheduling
based on CPU billing gathered from periodic process sampling ticks,
and gives preference to "interactive" processes that perform voluntary
sleeps, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption), as described in "Secretly Monopolizing the CPU Without
Superuser Privileges."
