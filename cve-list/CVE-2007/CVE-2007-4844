X-Diesel Unreal Commander 0.92 build 565 and 573 does not properly
react to an FTP server's behavior after sending a "CWD /" command,
which allows remote FTP servers to cause a denial of service (infinite
loop) by (1) repeatedly sending a 550 error response, or (2) sending a
550 error response and then disconnecting.
