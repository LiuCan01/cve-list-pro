The IA32 system call emulation functionality in Linux kernel 2.4.x and
2.6.x before 2.6.22.7, when running on the x86_64 architecture, does
not zero extend the eax register after the 32bit entry path to ptrace
is used, which might allow local users to gain privileges by
triggering an out-of-bounds access to the system call table using the
%RAX register.
