The session_start function in ext/session in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.7 and
5.x up to 5.2.3 allows remote attackers to insert arbitrary attributes
into the session cookie via special characters in a cookie that is
obtained from (1) PATH_INFO, (2) the session_id function, and (3) the
session_start function, which are not encoded or filtered when the new
session cookie is generated, a related issue to CVE-2006-0207.
