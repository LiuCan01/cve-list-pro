The _udp_lib_get_port function in net/ipv4/udp.c in Linux kernel
2.6.21 and earlier does not prevent a bind to a port with a local
address when there is already a bind to that port with a wildcard
local address, which might allow local users to intercept local
traffic for daemons or other applications.
