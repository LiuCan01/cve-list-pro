Stack-based buffer overflow in the Internet E-mail Auto-Protect
feature in Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition before 10.1, and
Client Security before 3.1, allows local users to cause a denial of
service (service crash) via a long (1) To, (2) From, or (3) Subject
header in an outbound SMTP e-mail message.  NOTE: the original vendor
advisory referenced CVE-2006-3456, but this was an error.
