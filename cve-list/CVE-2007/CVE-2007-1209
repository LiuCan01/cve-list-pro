Use-after-free vulnerability in the Client/Server Run-time Subsystem
(CSRSS) in Microsoft Windows Vista does not properly handle connection
resources when starting and stopping processes, which allows local
users to gain privileges by opening and closing multiple ApiPort
connections, which leaves a "dangling pointer" to a process data
structure.
