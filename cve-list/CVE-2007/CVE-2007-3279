PostgreSQL 8.1 and probably later versions, when the PL/pgSQL
(plpgsql) language has been created, grants certain plpgsql privileges
to the PUBLIC domain, which allows remote attackers to create and
execute functions, as demonstrated by functions that perform local
brute-force password guessing attacks, which may evade intrusion
detection.
