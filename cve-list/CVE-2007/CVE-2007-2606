Multiple buffer overflows in Firebird 2.1 allow attackers to trigger
memory corruption and possibly have other unspecified impact via
certain input processed by (1) configConfigFile.cpp or (2)
msgscheck_msgs.epp.  NOTE: if ConfigFile.cpp reads a configuration
file with restrictive permissions, then the ConfigFile.cpp vector may
not cross privilege boundaries and perhaps should not be included in
CVE.
