The ntfs-3g package before 1.913-2.fc7 in Fedora 7, and an ntfs-3g
package in Ubuntu 7.10/Gutsy, assign incorrect permissions (setuid
root) to mount.ntfs-3g, which allows local users with fuse group
membership to read from and write to arbitrary block devices, possibly
involving a file descriptor leak.
