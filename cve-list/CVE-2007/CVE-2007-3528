The blowfish mode in DAR before 2.3.4 uses weak Blowfish-CBC
cryptography by (1) discarding random bits by the blowfish::make_ivec
function in libdar/crypto.cpp that results in predictable and
repeating IV values, and (2) direct use of a password for keying,
which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to decrypt
files.
