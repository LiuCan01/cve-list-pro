Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component for Oracle
Database 9.0.1.5+, 9.2.0.7, and 10.1.0.4 on Windows systems has
unknown impact and attack vectors, aka DB03.  NOTE: as of 20070424,
Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that DB03 occurs because RDBMS
uses a NULL Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) for the Oracle
process and certain shared memory sections, which allows local users
to inject threads and execute arbitrary code via the OpenProcess,
OpenThread, and SetThreadContext functions (DB03).
