Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in
editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php in FCKeditor, as used in
SiteX CMS 0.7.3.beta, La-Nai CMS, Syntax CMS, Cardinal Cms, and
probably other products, allows remote attackers to upload and execute
arbitrary PHP code via a file whose name contains ".php." and has an
unknown extension, which is recognized as a .php file by the Apache
HTTP server, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0658 and
CVE-2006-2529.
