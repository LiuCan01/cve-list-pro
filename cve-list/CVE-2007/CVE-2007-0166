The jail rc.d script in FreeBSD 5.3 up to 6.2 does not verify
pathnames when writing to /var/log/console.log during a jail start-up,
or when file systems are mounted or unmounted, which allows local root
users to overwrite arbitrary files, or mount/unmount files, outside of
the jail via a symlink attack.
