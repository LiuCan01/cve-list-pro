** DISPUTED **

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in vBulletin 3.6.8
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web code or HTML via the
(1) s parameter to index.php, and the (2) q parameter to (a) faq.php,
(b) member.php, (c) memberlist.php, (d) calendar.php, (e) search.php,
(f) forumdisplay.php, (g) showgroups.php, (h) online.php, and (i)
sendmessage.php.  NOTE: these issues have been disputed by the vendor,
stating "I can't reproduce a single one of these".  The researcher is
known to be unreliable.
