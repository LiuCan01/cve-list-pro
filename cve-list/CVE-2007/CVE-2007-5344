Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 through 7 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted website using Javascript that
creates, modifies, deletes, and accesses document objects using the
tags property, which triggers heap corruption, related to
uninitialized or deleted objects, a different issue than CVE-2007-3902
and CVE-2007-3903, and a variant of "Uninitialized Memory Corruption
Vulnerability."
