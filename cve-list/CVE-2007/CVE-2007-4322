BlockHosts before 2.0.4 does not properly parse (1) sshd and (2)
vsftpd log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary deny
entries to the /etc/hosts.allow file and cause a denial of service by
adding arbitrary IP addresses to a daemon log file, as demonstrated by
connecting through ssh with a client protocol version identification
containing an IP address string, or connecting through ftp with a
username containing an IP address string, different vectors than
CVE-2007-2765.
