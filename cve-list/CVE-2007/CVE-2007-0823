xterm on Slackware Linux 10.2 stores information that had been
displayed for a different user account using the same xterm process,
which might allow local users to bypass file permissions and read
other users' files, or obtain other sensitive information, by reading
the xterm process memory.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is an
expected consequence of multiple users sharing the same interactive
process, in which case this is not a vulnerability.
