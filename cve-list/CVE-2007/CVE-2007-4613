SSL libraries in BEA WebLogic Server 6.1 Gold through SP7, 7.0 Gold
through SP7, and 8.1 Gold through SP5 might allow remote attackers to
obtain plaintext from an SSL stream via a man-in-the-middle attack
that injects crafted data and measures the elapsed time before an
error response, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-2461.
