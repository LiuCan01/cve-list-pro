Argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) in
Solaris 10 and 11 (SunOS 5.10 and 5.11) misinterprets certain client
"-f" sequences as valid requests for the login program to skip
authentication, which allows remote attackers to log into certain
accounts, as demonstrated by the bin account.
