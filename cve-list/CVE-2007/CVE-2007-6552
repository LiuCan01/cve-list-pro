Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in AuraCMS 2.2 allows
remote authenticated users to include and execute arbitrary local
files via a .. (dot dot) in the act parameter, possibly involving the
news pilih component; as demonstrated by including
admin/admin_users.php to bypass a protection mechanism against direct
request.
