** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in Trevorchan 0.7 and earlier
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the
tc_config[rootdir] parameter to (1) upgrade.php, (2) paint_save.php,
(3) menu.php, (4) manage.php, and (5) banned.php.  NOTE: his issue has
been disputed by reliable third parties, who state that the variable
is set before use in config.php.
