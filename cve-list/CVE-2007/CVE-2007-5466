Multiple buffer overflows in eXtremail 2.1.1 and earlier allow remote
attackers to (1) have an unknown impact by sending multiple long
strings to the IMAP port (143/tcp); (2) execute arbitrary code via a
long string in an IMAP AUTHENTICATE PLAIN action, involving the
ifParseAuthPlain function; (3) execute arbitrary code via a long LOGIN
command to the admin interface port (4501/tcp); or (4) execute
arbitrary code via a long string in an IMAP AUTHENTICATE LOGIN (aka
CRAM-MD5 authentication) action, involving the ifProcImapAuth1
function.
