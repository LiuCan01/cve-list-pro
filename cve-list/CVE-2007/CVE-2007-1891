Stack-based buffer overflow in the GetPrivateProfileSectionW function
in Akamai Technologies Download Manager ActiveX Control
(DownloadManagerV2.ocx) after 2.0.4.4 but before 2.2.1.0 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code, related to misinterpretation of
the nSize parameter as a byte count instead of a wide character count.
