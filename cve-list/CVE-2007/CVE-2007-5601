Stack-based buffer overflow in the Database Component in MPAMedia.dll
in RealNetworks RealPlayer 10.5 and 11 beta, and earlier versions
including 10, RealOne Player, and RealOne Player 2, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain playlist names, as
demonstrated via the import method to the IERPCtl ActiveX control in
ierpplug.dll.
