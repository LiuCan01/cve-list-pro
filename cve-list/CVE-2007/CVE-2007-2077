PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in search.php in Maian Search
1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the path_to_folder parameter.  NOTE: this issue was disputed by a
third party researcher, but confirmed by the vendor, stating "this
issue was fixed last year and [no] is longer a problem."
