Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Database 9.0.1.5 and 9.2.0.7 has
unknown impact and attack vectors related to the Log Miner component
and sys.dbms_log_mnr privileges, aka DB04.  NOTE: Oracle has not
disputed a reliable researcher claim that this is a buffer overflow in
the ADD_LOGFILE procedure for the SYS.DBMS_LOGMNR package that allows
code execution.
