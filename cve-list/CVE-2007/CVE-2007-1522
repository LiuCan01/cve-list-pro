Double free vulnerability in the session extension in PHP 5.2.0 and
5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
illegal characters in a session identifier, which is rejected by an
internal session storage module, which calls the session identifier
generator with an improper environment, leading to code execution when
the generator is interrupted, as demonstrated by triggering a memory
limit violation or certain PHP errors.
