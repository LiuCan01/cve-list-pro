Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.2.0.3 have
unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors related to (1)
Rules Manager and Expression Filter components (DB02) and (2) Oracle
Streams (DB06).  Note: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed
reliable claims that DB02 is for a race condition in the
RLMGR_TRUNCATE_MAINT trigger in the Rules Manager and Expression
Filter components changing the AUTHID of a package from DEFINER to
CURRENT_USER after a TRUNCATE call, and DB06 is for SQL injection in
the DBMS_APPLY_USER_AGENT.SET_REGISTRATION_HANDLER procedure, which is
later passed to the DBMS_APPLY_ADM_INTERNAL.ALTER_APPLY procedure, aka
"Oracle Streams".
