Multiple buffer overflows in the voicemail functionality in Asterisk
1.4.x before 1.4.13, when using IMAP storage, might allow (1) remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long combination of
Content-type and Content-description headers, or (2) local users to
execute arbitrary code via a long combination of astspooldir,
voicemail context, and voicemail mailbox fields.  NOTE: vector 2
requires write access to Asterisk configuration files.
