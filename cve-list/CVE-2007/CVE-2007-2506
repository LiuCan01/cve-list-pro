WebSpeed 3.x in OpenEdge 10.x in Progress Software Progress 9.1e, and
certain other 9.x versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (infinite loop and daemon hang) via a messenger URL that
invokes _edit.r with no additional parameters, as demonstrated by
requests for cgiip.exe or wsisa.dll with WService=wsbroker1/_edit.r in
the PATH_INFO.
