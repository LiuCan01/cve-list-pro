libmikmod 3.1.9 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod, SDL-mixer, and
possibly other products, relies on the channel count of the last
loaded song, rather than the currently playing song, for certain
playback calculations, which allows user-assisted attackers to cause a
denial of service (application crash) by loading multiple songs (aka
MOD files) with different numbers of channels.
