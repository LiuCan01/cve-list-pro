The luci server component in conga preserves the password between page
loads for the Add System/Cluster task flow by storing the password in
the Value attribute of a password entry field, which allows attackers
to steal the password by performing a "view source" or other operation
to obtain the web page.  NOTE: there are limited circumstances under
which such an attack is feasible.
