Heap-based buffer overflow in cygwin1.dll in Cygwin 1.5.7 and earlier
allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
filename with a certain length, as demonstrated by a remote
authenticated user who uses the SCP protocol to send a file to the
Cygwin machine, and thereby causes scp.exe on this machine to execute,
and then overwrite heap memory with characters from the filename.
NOTE: it is also reported that a related issue might exist in 1.5.7
through 1.5.19.
