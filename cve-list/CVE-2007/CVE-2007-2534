** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in admin.php in phpHoo3 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1)
ADMIN_USER (USER) and (2) ADMIN_PASS (PASS) parameters during a login.
NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability, since ADMIN_USER/ADMIN_PASS are
initialized before use.
