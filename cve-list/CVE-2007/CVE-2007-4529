The WebAdmin interface in TeamSpeak Server 2.0.20.1 allows remote
authenticated users with the ServerAdmin flag to assign Registered
users certain privileges, resulting in a privilege set that extends
beyond that ServerAdmin's own servers, as demonstrated by the (1)
AdminAddServer, (2) AdminDeleteServer, (3) AdminStartServer, and (4)
AdminStopServer privileges; and administration of arbitrary virtual
servers via a request to a .tscmd URI with a modified serverid
parameter, as demonstrated by (a) add_server.tscmd, (b)
ask_delete_server.tscmd, (c) start_server.tscmd, and (d)
stop_server.tscmd.
