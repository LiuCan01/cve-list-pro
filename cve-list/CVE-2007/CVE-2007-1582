The resource system in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1
allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code by
interrupting certain functions in the GD (ext/gd) extension and
unspecified other extensions via a userspace error handler, which can
be used to destroy and modify internal resources.
