** DISPUTED **

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Horde Groupware
Webmail 1.0 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via unspecified vectors in (1) imp/search.php and (2)
ingo/rule.php. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor,
noting that the search.php issue was resolved in CVE-2006-4255, and
attackers can only use rule.php to inject XSS into their own pages.
