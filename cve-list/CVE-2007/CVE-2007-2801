Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in open.php in
eTicket 1.5.5 and 1.5.5.1, when register_globals is enabled, allow
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1)
err and (2) warn parameters.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the
significance of the issue, stating that "eTicket is not designed to
work with register_globals On."
