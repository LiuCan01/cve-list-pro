The NIST SP 800-90A default statement of the Dual Elliptic Curve
Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm contains
point Q constants with a possible relationship to certain "skeleton
key" values, which might allow context-dependent attackers to defeat
cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of those
values.  NOTE: this is a preliminary CVE for Dual_EC_DRBG; future
research may provide additional details about point Q and associated
attacks, and could potentially lead to a RECAST or REJECT of this CVE.
