The Linksys WAG200G with firmware 1.01.01, WRT54GC 2 with firmware
1.00.7, and WRT54GC 1 with firmware 1.03.0 and earlier allow remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information (passwords and configuration
data) via a packet to UDP port 916. NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
