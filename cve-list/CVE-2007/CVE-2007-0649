Variable overwrite vulnerability in interface/globals.php in OpenEMR
2.8.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary
program variables and conduct other unauthorized activities, such as
conduct (a) remote file inclusion attacks via the srcdir parameter in
custom/import_xml.php or (b) cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
the rootdir parameter in interface/login/login_frame.php, via vectors
associated with extract operations on the (1) POST and (2) GET
superglobal arrays.  NOTE: this issue was originally disputed before
the extract behavior was identified in post-disclosure analysis.
Also, the original report identified "Open Conference Systems," but
this was an error.
