Heap-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime before 7.1.5 allows
remote user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a QTIF file with a Video
Sample Description containing a Color table ID of 0, which triggers
memory corruption when QuickTime assumes that a color table exists.
