The Component Object Model (COM) functions in PHP 5.x on Windows do
not follow safe_mode and disable_functions restrictions, which allows
context-dependent attackers to bypass intended limitations, as
demonstrated by executing objects with the kill bit set in the
corresponding ActiveX control Compatibility Flags, executing programs
via a function in compatUI.dll, invoking wscript.shell via
wscript.exe, invoking Scripting.FileSystemObject via wshom.ocx, and
adding users via a function in shgina.dll, related to the
com_load_typelib function.
