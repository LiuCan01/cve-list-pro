index.php in vtiger CRM before 5.0.3 allows remote authenticated users
to obtain all users' names and e-mail addresses, and possibly change
user settings, via a modified record parameter in a DetailView action
to the Users module.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the changing of
settings, reporting that the attack vector results in a "You are not
permitted to execute this Operation" error message in a 5.0.3 demo.
