Unspecified vulnerability in Apple QuickTime 7.2 on Windows XP allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown attack vectors,
probably a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-6166.  NOTE: this
information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability
information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors
or release advisories with actionable information.  A CVE has been
assigned for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are
difficult to determine.  However, the organization has stated that
this is different than CVE-2007-6166.
