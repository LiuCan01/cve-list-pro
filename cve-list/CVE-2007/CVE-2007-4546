Unreal Commander 0.92 build 565 and 573 lists the filenames from the
Central Directory of a ZIP archive, but extracts to local filenames
corresponding to names in Local File Header fields in this archive,
which might allow remote attackers to trick a user into performing a
dangerous file overwrite or creation.
