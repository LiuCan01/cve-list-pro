EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 8.2 does not properly handle certain
debugging function calls that occur before a call to
pldbg_create_listener, which allows remote authenticated users to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a SELECT statement that invokes a pldbg_ function,
as demonstrated by (1) pldbg_get_stack and (2) pldbg_abort_target,
which triggers use of an uninitialized pointer.
