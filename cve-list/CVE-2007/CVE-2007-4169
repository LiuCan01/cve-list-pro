** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in vgallite allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1)
dirpath parameter to _functions.php or the (2) lang parameter to
index.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes vector 1 because the applicable
include_once is located in a function that is not called on a direct
request, and because $dirpath is an argument to this function.  CVE
disputes vector 2 because "lang" is a constant string within an
include_once, not a variable.  The researcher is also unreliable.
