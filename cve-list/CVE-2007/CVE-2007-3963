Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in UseBB 1.0.7,
and possibly other 1.0.x versions, allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO (PHP_SELF) to (1)
upgrade-0-2-3.php, (2) upgrade-0-3.php, or (3) upgrade-0-4.php in
install/, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-4193.
