Multiple format string vulnerabilities in AFFLIB 2.2.6 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain command line
parameters, which are used in (1) warn and (2) err calls, possibly
involving (a) lib/s3.cpp, (b) tools/afconvert.cpp, (c)
tools/afcopy.cpp, (d) tools/afinfo.cpp, (e) aimage/imager.cpp, and (f)
tools/afxml.cpp.  NOTE: this identifier is intended to address the
