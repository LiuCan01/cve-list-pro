** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in myBloggie 2.1.5
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
bloggie_root_path parameter to (1) config.php; (2) db.php, (3)
template.php, (4) functions.php, and (5) classes.php in includes/; (6)
viewmode.php; and (7) blog_body.php.  NOTE: another researcher
disputes the vulnerability because the files are protected against
direct requests, contain no relevant include statements, or do not
exist.


Current Votes:
None (candidate not yet proposed)
