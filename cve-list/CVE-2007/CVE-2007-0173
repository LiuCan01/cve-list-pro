Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in L2J Statistik Script
0.09 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes is
disabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
local files via a .. (dot dot) in the page parameter, as demonstrated
by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which
is then included by index.php.
