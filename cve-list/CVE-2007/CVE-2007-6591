KDE Konqueror 3.5.5 and 3.95.00, when a user accepts an SSL server
certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field,
regards the certificate as also accepted for all domain names in
subjectAltName:dNSName fields, even though these fields cannot be
examined in the product, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
trick a user into accepting an invalid certificate for a spoofed web
site.
