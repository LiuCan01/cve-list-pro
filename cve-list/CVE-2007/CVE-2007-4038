Argument injection vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.5,
when running on systems with Thunderbird 1.5 installed and certain
URIs registered, allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser
scripting attacks and execute arbitrary commands via shell
metacharacters in a mailto URI, which are inserted into the command
line that is created when invoking Thunderbird.exe, a similar issue to
CVE-2007-3670.
