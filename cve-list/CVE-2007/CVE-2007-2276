** DISPUTED **

3Com TippingPoint IPS allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (device hang) via a flood of packets on TCP port 80 with
sequentially increasing source ports, related to a "badly written
loop."  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that the product
has "performed as expected with no DoS emerging."
