The login_to_simulator method in Linden Lab Second Life, as used by
the secondlife:// protocol handler and possibly other Second Life
login mechanisms, sends an MD5 hash in cleartext in the passwd field,
which allows remote attackers to login to an account by sniffing the
network and then sending this hash to a Second Life authentication
server.
