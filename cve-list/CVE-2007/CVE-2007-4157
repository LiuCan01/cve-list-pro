PHPBlogger stores sensitive information under the web root with
insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download
a database containing an admin password hash via a direct request for
data/pref.db.  NOTE: this can be easily leveraged for administrative
access because composing the authentication cookie only requires the
password hash, not the cleartext version.
