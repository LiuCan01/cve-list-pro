Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (server instability or device
hang), and possibly obtain sensitive information (device communication
traffic); and might allow attackers with physical access to execute
arbitrary code after connecting a data stream to a device COM port;
via requests for a URI containing a '/' immediately before and after
the name of a DOS device, as demonstrated by the /AUX/.aspx URI, which
bypasses a blacklist for DOS device requests.
