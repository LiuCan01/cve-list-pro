Vidalia bundle before 0.1.2.18, when running on Windows and Mac OS X,
installs Privoxy with a configuration file (config.txt or config) that
contains insecure (1) enable-remote-toggle and (2) enable-edit-actions
settings, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and modify configuration.
