Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the Monolith Lithtech
engine, as used by First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.) 1.08 and
earlier, when Punkbuster (PB) is enabled, allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via
format string specifiers in (1) a PB_Y packet to the YPG server on UDP
port 27888 or (2) a PB_U packet to UCON on UDP port 27888, different
vectors than CVE-2004-1500.  NOTE: this issue might be in Punkbuster
itself, but there are insufficient details to be certain.
