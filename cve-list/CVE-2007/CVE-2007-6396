Direct static code injection vulnerability in index.php in Flat PHP
Board 1.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP
code via the (1) username, (2) password, and (3) email parameters when
registering a user account, which can be executed by accessing the
user's php file for this account.  NOTE: similar code injection might
be possible in a user profile.
