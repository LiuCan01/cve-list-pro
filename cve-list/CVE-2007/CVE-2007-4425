Multiple buffer overflows in Live for Speed (LFS) demo, S1, and S2
allow remote authenticated users to (1) cause a denial of service
(server crash) and probably execute arbitrary code via an ID 3 packet
with a long nickname field, and (2) cause a denial of service (server
crash) via an ID 10 packet containing a long string corresponding to
an unavailable track.
