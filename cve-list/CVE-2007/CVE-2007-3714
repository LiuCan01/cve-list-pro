Directory traversal vulnerability in Ada Image Server (ImgSvr) 0.6.5
allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in
the template parameter to the default URI.  NOTE: the provenance of
this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from
third party information.  NOTE: this is probably a different issue
than CVE-2004-2464.  NOTE: it was later reported that 0.6.21 and
earlier is also affected.
