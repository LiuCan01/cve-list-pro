Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0.0.125 does not properly validate
certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function
handlers, which allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly gain privileges via the NtCreateSection kernel
SSDT hook or (2) cause a denial of service (avp.exe service outage)
via the NtLoadDriver kernel SSDT hook.  NOTE: this issue may partially
overlap CVE-2006-3074.
