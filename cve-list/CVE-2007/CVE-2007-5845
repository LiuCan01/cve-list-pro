Directory traversal vulnerability in error.php in GuppY 4.6.3, 4.5.16,
and earlier allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
local files via a .. (dot dot) in the id parameter.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged to bypass authentication and upload arbitrary files by
including admin/inc/upload.inc and specifying certain
multipart/form-data input for admin/inc/upload.inc.
