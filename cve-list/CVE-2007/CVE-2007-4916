Heap-based buffer overflow in the FileFind::FindFile method in (1)
MFC42.dll, (2) MFC42u.dll, (3) MFC71.dll, and (4) MFC71u.dll in
Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library 8.0, as used by the ListFiles
method in hpqutil.dll 2.0.0.138 in Hewlett-Packard (HP) All-in-One and
Photo & Imaging Gallery 1.1 and probably other products, allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via a long first argument.
