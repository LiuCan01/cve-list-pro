suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 uses a partial comparison
for verifying whether the current directory is within the document
root, which might allow local users to perform unauthorized operations
on incorrect directories, as demonstrated using "html_backup" and
"htmleditor" under an "html" directory.  NOTE: the researcher, who is
reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue because "the
attacks described rely on an insecure server configuration" in which
the user "has write access to the document root."
