Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/36396

The NFSv4 ID mapper (nfsidmap) before 0.17 does not properly handle
return values from the getpwnam_r function when performing a username
lookup, which can cause it to report a file as being owned by "root"
instead of "nobody" if the file exists on the server but not on the
client.
