Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Ipswitch WS_FTP allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via arguments
to a valid command, which is not properly handled when it is displayed
by the view log option in the administration interface.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged to create a new admin account.
