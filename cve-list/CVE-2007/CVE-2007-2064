Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Robert
Ladstaetter ActionPoll 1.1.0, and possibly 1.1.1, allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in (1) the
CONFIG_POLLDB parameter to actionpoll.php or (2) the CONFIG_DB
parameter to db/DataReaderWriter.php, different vectors than
CVE-2001-1297.
