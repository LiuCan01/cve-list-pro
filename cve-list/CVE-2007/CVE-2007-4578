Sophos Anti-Virus for Windows and for Unix/Linux before 2.48.0 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted UPX packed file, resulting from
an "integer cast around".  NOTE: as of 20070828, the vendor says this
is a DoS and the researcher says this allows code execution, but the
researcher is reliable.
