The AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) protocol handler in Cerulean Studios
Trillian allows remote attackers to create files with arbitrary
contents via certain aim: URIs, as demonstrated by a URI that begins
with the "aim: &c:" substring and contains a full pathname in the ini
field.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a
Startup folder.
