Buffer overflow in NetSupport Manager (NSM) Client 10.00 and 10.20,
and NetSupport School Student (NSS) 9.00, allows remote NSM servers to
cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted data in the configuration exchange phase of an initial
connection setup.  NOTE: a vendor statement, which is too vague to be
sure that it is for this particular issue, says that only a denial of
service is possible.
