** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in phpXmms 1.0
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
tcmdp parameter to (1) phpxmmsb.php or (2) phpxmmst.php.  NOTE: this
issue has been disputed by a reliable third party, stating that the
tcmdp variable is initialized by config.php.
