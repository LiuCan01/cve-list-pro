The Tomcat 4.1-based Servlet Service in Fujitsu Interstage Application
Server 7.0 through 9.0.0 and Interstage Apworks/Studio 7.0 through
9.0.0 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (web
root path) via unspecified vectors that trigger an error message,
probably related to enabling the useCanonCaches Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) option.
