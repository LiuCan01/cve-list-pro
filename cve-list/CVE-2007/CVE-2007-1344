Multiple buffer overflows in src/ezstream.c in Ezstream before 0.3.0
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted XML
configuration file processed by the (1) urlParse function, which
causes a stack-based overflow and the (2) ReplaceString function,
which causes a heap-based overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
