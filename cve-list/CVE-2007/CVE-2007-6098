Ingate Firewall before 4.6.0 and SIParator before 4.6.0 do not log
truncated (1) ICMP, (2) UDP, and (3) TCP packets, which has unknown
impact and remote attack vectors; and do not log (4) serial-console
login attempts with nonexistent usernames, which might make it easier
for attackers with physical access to guess valid login credentials
while avoiding detection.
