SAXON 5.4, with display_errors enabled, allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via (1) a direct request for news.php,
(2) an invalid use of a newsid array parameter to admin/edit-item.php,
and possibly unspecified vectors related to additional scripts in (3)
admin/, (4) rss/, and (5) the root directory of the installation,
which reveal the path in various error messages.
