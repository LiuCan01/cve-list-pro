The default configuration for autofs 5 (autofs5) in some Linux
distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5, does
not specify the nodev mount option for the -hosts map, which allows
local users to access "important devices" by operating a remote NFS
server and creating special device files on that server, as
demonstrated by the /dev/mem device.
