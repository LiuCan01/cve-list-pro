** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Modules Builder
(modbuild) 4.1 for Comdev One Admin allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the path[docroot] parameter to (1)
config-bak.php or (2) config.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes this
vulnerability because the unmodified scripts set the applicable
variable to the empty string; reasonable modified copies would use a
fixed pathname string.
