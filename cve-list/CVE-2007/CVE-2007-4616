The SSL server implementation in BEA WebLogic Server 7.0 Gold through
SP7, 8.1 Gold through SP6, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2 Gold through MP1, and 10.0
sometimes selects the null cipher when no other cipher is compatible
between the server and client, which might allow remote attackers to
intercept communications.
