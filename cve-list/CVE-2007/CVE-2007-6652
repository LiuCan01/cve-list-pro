cpie.php in XCMS 1.83 and earlier sends a redirect to the web browser
but does not exit, which allows remote attackers to conduct direct
static code injection attacks and execute arbitrary code via the
testo_0 parameter in a cpie admin action to index.php, which writes to
dati/generali/footer.dtb (aka the XCMS footer).
