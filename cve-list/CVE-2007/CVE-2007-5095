Microsoft Windows Media Player (WMP) 9 on Windows XP SP2 invokes
Internet Explorer to render HTML documents contained inside some media
files, regardless of what default web browser is configured, which
might allow remote attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in software
that the user does not expect to run, as demonstrated by the HTMLView
parameter in an .asx file.
