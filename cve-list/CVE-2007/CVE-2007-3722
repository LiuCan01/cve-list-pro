The 4BSD process scheduler in the FreeBSD kernel performs scheduling
based on CPU billing gathered from periodic process sampling ticks,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption) by performing voluntary nanosecond sleeps that result in
the process not being active during a clock interrupt, as described in
"Secretly Monopolizing the CPU Without Superuser Privileges."
