** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in local Calendar
System 1.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the (1) TEMPLATE_DIR parameter to (a) showinvoices.php, (b)
showmonth.php, (c) showevents.php, (d) retrieveinvoice.php, (e)
modifyitem.php, and (f) lookup_userid.php; or the LIBDIR parameter to
(g) editevent.php, (h) resetpassword.php, (i) signup.php,
showmonth.php, (j) showday.php, showevents.php, and lookup_userid.php.
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that
the associated variables are set in config.php before use.
