VMware Workstation 5.5.3 34685, when the "Enable copy and paste to and
from this virtual machine" option is enabled, preserves clipboard data
on the guest operating system after it was deleted on the host
operating system, which might allow local users to read clipboard
contents by moving the focus back to the host operating system.
