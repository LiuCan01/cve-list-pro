The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails
1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute
from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which effectively causes
cookie_only to be applied only to the first instantiation of
CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation
attacks.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380.
