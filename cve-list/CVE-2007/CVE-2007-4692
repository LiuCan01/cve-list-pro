The tabbed browsing feature in Apple Safari 3 before Beta Update 3.0.4
on Windows, and Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.4.10, allows remote attackers
to spoof HTTP authentication for other sites and possibly conduct
phishing attacks by causing an authentication sheet to be displayed
for a tab that is not active, which makes it appear as if it is
associated with the active tab.
