EZPhotoSales 1.9.3 and earlier stores sensitive information under the
web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote
attackers to download (1) a file containing cleartext passwords via a
direct request for OnlineViewing/data/galleries.txt, or (2) a file
containing username hashes and password hashes via a direct request
for OnlineViewing/configuration/config.dat/.  NOTE: vector 2 can be
leveraged for administrative access because authentication does not
require knowledge of cleartext values, but instead uses the username
hash in the ConfigLogin parameter and the password hash in the
ConfigPassword parameter.
