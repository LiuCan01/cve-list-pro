The APPLSYS.FND_DM_NODES package in Oracle E-Business Suite does not
check for valid sessions, which allows remote attackers to delete
arbitrary nodes.  NOTE: due to lack of details from Oracle, it is not
clear whether this issue is related to other CVE identifiers such as
CVE-2007-2126, CVE-2007-2127, or CVE-2007-2128.
