** REJECT **

The getlock function in aimage/aimage.cpp in AFFLIB 2.2.8 and earlier
allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack
on temporary lock files (aka "time-of-check-time-of-use file race").
NOTE: the researcher has retracted the original advisory, stating that
"the portion of vulnerable code is not called in any current version
of AFFLIB and is therefore not exploitable."
