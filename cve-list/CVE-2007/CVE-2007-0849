scripts/cronscript.php in SysCP 1.2.15 and earlier does not properly
quote pathnames in user home directories, which allows local users to
gain privileges by placing shell metacharacters in a directory name,
and then using the control panel to protect this directory, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2568.
