A certain ActiveX control in (1) OScan8.ocx and (2) Oscan81.ocx in
BitDefender Online Anti-Virus Scanner 8.0 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a long argument to the InitX method that
begins with a "%%" sequence, which is misinterpreted as a Unicode
string and decoded twice, leading to improper memory allocation and a
heap-based buffer overflow.
