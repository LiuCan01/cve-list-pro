The Visionsoft Audit on Demand Service (VSAOD) in Visionsoft Audit
12.4.0.0 does not require authentication for (1) the "LOG." command,
which allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files;
(2) the SETTINGSFILE command, which allows remote attackers to
overwrite the ini file, and reconfigure VSAOD or cause a denial of
service; or (3) the UNINSTALL command, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (daemon shutdown).  NOTE: vector 1 can be
leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
