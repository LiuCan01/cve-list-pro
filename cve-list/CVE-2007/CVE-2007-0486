** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Openads (aka
phpAdsNew) 2.0.7 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the (1) phpAds_geoPlugin parameter to
libraries/lib-remotehost.inc, the (2) filename parameter to
admin/report-index, or the (3) phpAds_config[my_footer] parameter to
admin/lib-gui.inc.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, stating
that the relevant variables are used within function definitions.
