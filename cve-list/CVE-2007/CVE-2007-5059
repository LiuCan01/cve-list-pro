Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in GreenSQL allow
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via several
vectors, as demonstrated by the (1) uname and (2) pass parameters in a
login form, and (3) an unspecified "url value," leading to storage of
XSS sequences in the database and display of these sequences in the
alert section of the admin panel.
