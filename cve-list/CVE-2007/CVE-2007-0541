WordPress allows remote attackers to determine the existence of
arbitrary files, and possibly read portions of certain files, via
pingback service calls with a source URI that corresponds to a local
pathname, which triggers different fault codes for existing and
non-existing files, and in certain configurations causes a brief file
excerpt to be published as a blog comment.
