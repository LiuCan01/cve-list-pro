** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
includes/usercp_register.php in phpBB 2.0.19 allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the phpbb_root_path
parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third-party
researchers, stating that the file checks for a global constant and
cannot be accessed directly.
