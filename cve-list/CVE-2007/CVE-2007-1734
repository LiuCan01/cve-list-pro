The DCCP support in the do_dccp_getsockopt function in
net/dccp/proto.c in Linux kernel 2.6.20 and later does not verify the
upper bounds of the optlen value, which allows local users running on
certain architectures to read kernel memory or cause a denial of
service (oops), a related issue to CVE-2007-1730.
