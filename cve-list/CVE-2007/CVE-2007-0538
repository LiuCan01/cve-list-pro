Telligent Community Server 2.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (bandwidth or thread consumption) via
pingback service calls with a source URI that corresponds to (1) a
large file, which triggers a long download session without a timeout
constraint; or (2) a file with a binary content type, which is
downloaded even though it cannot contain usable pingback data.
