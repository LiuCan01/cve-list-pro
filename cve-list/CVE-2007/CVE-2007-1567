Stack-based buffer overflow in War FTP Daemon 1.65, and possibly
earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by
warftp_165.tar by Immunity.  NOTE: this might be the same issue as
CVE-1999-0256, CVE-2000-0131, or CVE-2006-2171, but due to Immunity's
lack of details, this cannot be certain.
