Entrust Entelligence Security Provider (ESP) 8 does not properly
validate certificates in certain circumstances involving (1) a chain
that omits the root Certification Authority (CA) certificate, or an
application that specifies disregarding (2) unknown revocation
statuses during path validation or (3) certain errors in the
certification path, which might allow context-dependent attackers to
spoof certificate authentication.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
party information.
