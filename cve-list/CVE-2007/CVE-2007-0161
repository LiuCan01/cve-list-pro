The PML Driver HPZ12 (HPZipm12.exe) in the HP all-in-one drivers, as
used by multiple HP products, uses insecure SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG DACL
permissions, which allows local users to gain privileges and execute
arbitrary programs, as demonstrated by modifying the binpath argument,
a related issue to CVE-2006-0023.
