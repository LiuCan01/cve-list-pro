Heap-based buffer overflow in Cerulean Studios Trillian 3.x before
3.1.6.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
message sent through the MSN protocol, or possibly other protocols,
with a crafted UTF-8 string, which triggers improper memory allocation
for word wrapping when a window width is used as a buffer size, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2007-2478.
