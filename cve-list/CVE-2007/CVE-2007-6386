Stack-based buffer overflow in PccScan.dll before build 1451 in Trend
Micro AntiVirus plus AntiSpyware 2008, Internet Security 2008, and
Internet Security Pro 2008 allows user-assisted remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (SfCtlCom.exe crash), and allows local users
to gain privileges, via a malformed .zip archive with a long name, as
demonstrated by a .zip file created via format string specifiers in a
crafted .uue file.
