Queue.dll for the message queuing service (LQserver.exe) in CA
BrightStor ARCServe BackUp v9.01 through R11.5, and Enterprise Backup
r10.5, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
malformed ONRPC protocol request for operation 0x76, which causes
ARCserve Backup to dereference arbitrary pointers.
