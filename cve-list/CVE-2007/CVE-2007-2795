Multiple buffer overflows in Ipswitch IMail before 2006.21 allow
remote attackers or authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via
(1) the authentication feature in IMailsec.dll, which triggers heap
corruption in the IMail Server, or (2) a long SUBSCRIBE IMAP command,
which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow in the IMAP Daemon.
