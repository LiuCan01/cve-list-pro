Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in admin.bbcode.php in
Connectix Boards 0.7 and earlier allows remote authenticated
administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a crafted
GIF smiley image with a .php extension via the uploadimage parameter
to admin.php, which can be later accessed via a direct request for the
file in smileys/.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with a separate SQL
injection issue for remote unauthenticated attacks.
