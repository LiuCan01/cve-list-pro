** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Jelsoft
vBulletin 3.6.5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the (1) classfile parameter to includes/functions.php,
the (2) nextitem parameter to includes/functions_cron.php, and the (3)
specialtemplates parameter to includes/functions_forumdisplay.php.
NOTE: this issue is disputed by a reliable third party who states
"further investigation has revealed that the application is not
vulnerable to this issue."  The original researcher also has a history
of erroneous claims.


Current Votes:
