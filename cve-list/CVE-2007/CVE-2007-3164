Microsoft Internet Explorer 7, when prompting for HTTP Basic
Authentication for an IDN web site, uses ACE labels for the domain
name in the status bar, but uses internationalized labels for this
name in the authentication dialog, which might allow remote attackers
to perform phishing attacks if the user misinterprets confusable
characters in the internationalized labels, as demonstrated by
displaying xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com only in the status bar.
