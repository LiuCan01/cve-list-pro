DenyHosts 2.6 processes OpenSSH sshd "not listed in AllowUsers" log
messages with an incorrect regular expression that does not match an
IP address, which might allow remote attackers to avoid detection and
blocking when making invalid login attempts with a username not
present in AllowUsers, as demonstrated by the root username, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2007-4323.
