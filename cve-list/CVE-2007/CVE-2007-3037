Microsoft Windows Media Player 7.1, 9, 10, and 11 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a skin file (WMZ or WMD) with
crafted header information that causes a size mismatch between
compressed and decompressed data and triggers a heap-based buffer
overflow, aka "Windows Media Player Code Execution Vulnerability
Parsing Skins."
