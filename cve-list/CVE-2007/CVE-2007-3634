Unspecified vulnerability in the G/PGP (GPG) Plugin 2.0 for
Squirrelmail 1.4.10a allows remote authenticated users to execute
arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors, possibly related to the
passphrase variable in the gpg_sign_attachment function, aka
ZD-00000004.  this information is based upon a vague advisory by a
vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate
with vendors or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned
for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to
determine.
