Directory traversal vulnerability in the EmChartBean server side
component for Oracle Application Server 10g allows remote attackers to
read arbitrary files via unknown vectors, probably ".." sequences in
the beanId parameter.  NOTE: this is likely a duplicate of another CVE
that Oracle addressed in CPU Jan 2007, but due to lack of details by
Oracle, it is unclear which BugID this issue is associated with, so
the other CVE cannot be determined.  Possibilities include EM02
(CVE-2007-0292) or EM05 (CVE-2007-0293).
