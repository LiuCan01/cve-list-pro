Unreal Commander 0.92 build 565 and 573 writes portions of heap memory
into local files when extracting from an archive with malformed size
information in a file header, which might allow user-assisted
attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) by reading
the extracted files.  NOTE: this issue is only a vulnerability if
Unreal is run with privileges, or if the extracted files are made
accessible to other users.
