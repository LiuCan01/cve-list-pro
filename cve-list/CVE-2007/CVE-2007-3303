Apache httpd 2.0.59 and 2.2.4, with the Prefork MPM module, allows
local users to cause a denial of service via certain code sequences
executed in a worker process that (1) stop request processing by
killing all worker processes and preventing creation of replacements
or (2) hang the system by forcing the master process to fork an
arbitrarily large number of worker processes.  NOTE: This might be an
inherent design limitation of Apache with respect to worker processes
in hosted environments.
