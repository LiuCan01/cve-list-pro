ZixForum 1.14 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web
root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers
to download a database containing passwords via a direct request for
Zixforum.mdb.  NOTE: a followup post suggests that this issue only
occurs if the administrator does not properly follow installation
directions.
