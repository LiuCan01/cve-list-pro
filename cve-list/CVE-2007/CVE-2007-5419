The 3Com 3CRWER100-75 router with 1.2.10ww software, when enabling an
optional virtual server, configures this server to accept all source
IP addresses on the external (Internet) interface unless the user
selects other options, which might expose the router to unintended
incoming traffic from remote attackers, as demonstrated by setting up
a virtual server on port 80, which allows remote attackers to access
the web management interface.
