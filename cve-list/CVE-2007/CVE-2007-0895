Race condition in recursive directory deletion with the (1) -r or (2)
-R option in rm in Solaris 8 through 10 before 20070208 allows local
users to delete files and directories as the user running rm by moving
a low-level directory to a higher level as it is being deleted, which
causes rm to chdir to a ".." directory that is higher than expected,
possibly up to the root file system, a related issue to CVE-2002-0435.
