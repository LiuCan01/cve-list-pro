Meridian Prolog Manager 2007, and 7.5 and earlier, sends all usernames
and passwords to the client in a (1) cleartext or (2) weakly encrypted
format to support client-side login authentication, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to obtain database access by capturing
credentials via a man-in-the-middle attack.
