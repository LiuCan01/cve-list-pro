Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the AXIS 2100
Network Camera 2.02 with firmware before 2.43 allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) parameters associated
with saved settings, as demonstrated by the conf_SMTP_MailServer1
parameter to ServerManager.srv; or (2) the subpage parameter to
wizard/first/wizard_main_first.shtml.  NOTE: an attacker can leverage a
CSRF vulnerability to modify saved settings.
