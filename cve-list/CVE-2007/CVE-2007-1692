The default configuration of Microsoft Windows uses the Web Proxy
Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) without static WPAD entries, which might
allow remote attackers to intercept web traffic by registering a proxy
server using WINS or DNS, then responding to WPAD requests, as
demonstrated using Internet Explorer.  NOTE: it could be argued that
if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic
could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this
would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a
vulnerability.  It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate
attack vector.
