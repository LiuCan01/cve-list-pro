** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in FrontAccounting
(FA) 1.12 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the path_to_root parameter to (1) access/logout.php or certain
PHP scripts under (2) admin/, (3) dimensions/, (4) gl/, (5)
inventory/, (6) manufacturing/, (7) purchasing/, (8) reporting/, (9)
sales/, or (10) taxes/.  NOTE: the config.php vector is already
covered by CVE-2007-4279, and the login.php and language.php vectors
are already covered by CVE-2007-5117.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by
CVE because path_to_root is defined before use in all of the other
files reported in the original disclosure.
