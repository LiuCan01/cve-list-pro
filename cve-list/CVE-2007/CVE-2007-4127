** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in check_entry.php in Ralf
Image Gallery (RIG), aka Raphael Moll RIG Image Gallery, 1.0 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
dir_abs_src parameter.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by multiple third
parties, who report that the product exits if register_globals is
enabled, thereby blocking exploitation.  NOTE: CVE-2006-3210.a covers
this issue in versions before 1.0.
