The Nortel UNIStim IP Softphone 2050, IP Phone 1140E, and additional
Nortel products from the IP Phone, Business Communications Manager
(BCM), Mobile Voice Client, and other product lines, allow remote
attackers to block calls and force re-registration via a resume
message to the Signaling Server that has a spoofed source IP address
for the phone.  NOTE: the attack is more disruptive if a new spoofed
resume message is sent after each re-registration.
