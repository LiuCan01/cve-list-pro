The IBM Lenovo Access Support acpRunner ActiveX control, as
distributed in acpcontroller.dll before 1.2.8.0 and possibly acpir.dll
before 1.0.0.9 (Automated Solutions 1.0 before fix pack 1), does not
properly validate digital signatures of downloaded software, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof a download.
