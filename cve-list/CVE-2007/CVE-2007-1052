** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in PBLang (PBL)
4.60 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the dbpath parameter, a different vector than
CVE-2006-5062.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a reliable third
party for 4.65, stating that the dbpath variable is initialized in an
included file that is created upon installation.
