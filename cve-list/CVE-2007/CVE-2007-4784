The setlocale function in PHP before 5.2.4 allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long
string in the locale parameter.  NOTE: this might not be a
vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple
threads, unless this issue can be demonstrated for code execution.
