Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x before 1.2.26 and 1.4.x before 1.4.16, and
Business Edition B.x.x before B.2.3.6 and C.x.x before C.1.0-beta8,
when using database-based registrations ("realtime") and host-based
authentication, does not check the IP address when the username is
correct and there is no password, which allows remote attackers to
bypass authentication using a valid username.
