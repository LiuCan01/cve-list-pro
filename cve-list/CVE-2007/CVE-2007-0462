The _GetSrcBits32ARGB function in Apple QuickDraw, as used by
Quicktime 7.1.3 and other applications on Mac OS X 10.4.8 and earlier,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT image
with a malformed Alpha RGB (ARGB) record, which triggers memory
corruption.
