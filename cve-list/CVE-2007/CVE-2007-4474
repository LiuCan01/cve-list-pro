Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the IBM Lotus Domino Web
Access ActiveX control, as provided by inotes6.dll, inotes6w.dll,
dwa7.dll, and dwa7w.dll, in Domino 6.x and 7.x allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by an overflow from a long
General_ServerName property value when calling the
InstallBrowserHelperDll function in the Upload Module in the
dwa7.dwa7.1 control in dwa7w.dll 7.0.34.1.
