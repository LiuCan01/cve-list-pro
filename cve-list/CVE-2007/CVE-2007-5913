dirsys/modules/auth.php in JBC Explorer 7.20 RC1 and earlier does not
require authentication, which allows remote attackers to (1) delete
auth.inc.php via the suppr parameter, and (2) re-create the
auth.inc.php file with contents that specify a new account name and
password for JBC Explorer via the login and password parameters.
