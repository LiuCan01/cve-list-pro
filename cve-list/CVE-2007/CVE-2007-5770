The (1) Net::ftptls, (2) Net::telnets, (3) Net::imap, (4) Net::pop,
and (5) Net::smtp libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 do not verify that
the commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain
name in a request sent over SSL, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle
attack or spoofed web site, different components than CVE-2007-5162.
