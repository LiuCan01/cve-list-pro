Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CSRF protection scheme
in WordPress before 2.0.6 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via a CSRF attack with an invalid token and quote
characters or HTML tags in URL variable names, which are not properly
handled when WordPress generates a new link to verify the request.
