Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the Perl Compatible Regular
Expressions (PCRE) library in the JavaScript engine in WebKit in Apple
Safari 3 Beta before Update 3.0.3, and iPhone before 1.0.1, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain JavaScript
regular expressions. NOTE: this issue was originally reported only for
MobileSafari on the iPhone.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this stems
from an issue in the original distribution of PCRE, which might
already have a separate CVE identifier.
