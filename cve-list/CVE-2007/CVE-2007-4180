** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in data/inc/theme.php in Pluck 4.3,
when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter.  NOTE:
CVE and a reliable third party dispute this vulnerability because the
code uses a fixed argument when invoking fputs, which cannot be used
to read files.
