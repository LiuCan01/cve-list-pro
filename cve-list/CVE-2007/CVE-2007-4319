The management interface in ZyNOS firmware 3.62(WK.6) on the Zyxel
Zywall 2 device allows remote authenticated administrators to cause a
denial of service (infinite reboot loop) via invalid configuration
data.  NOTE: this issue might not cross privilege boundaries, and it
might be resultant from CSRF; if so, then it should not be included in
CVE.
