The SIP channel driver (chan_sip) in Asterisk Open Source 1.4.x before
1.4.11, AsteriskNOW before beta7, Asterisk Appliance Developer Kit 0.x
before 0.8.0, and s800i (Asterisk Appliance) 1.x before 1.0.3 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via
a SIP dialog that causes a large number of history entries to be
created.
