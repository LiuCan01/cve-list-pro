** DISPUTED **

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Admin
Control Panel (AdminCP) in Jelsoft vBulletin 3.6.4 allow remote
authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via unspecified vectors related to the (1) User Group Manager, (2)
User Rank Manager, (3) User Title Manager, (4) BB Code Manager, (5)
Attachment Manager, (6) Calendar Manager, and (7) Forums & Moderators
functions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that
modifying HTML is an intended privilege of an administrator.  NOTE: it
is possible that this issue overlaps CVE-2006-6040.
