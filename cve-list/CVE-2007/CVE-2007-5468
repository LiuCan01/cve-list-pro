Cisco CallManager 5.1.1.3000-5 does not verify the Digest
authentication header URI against the Request URI in SIP messages,
which allows remote attackers to use sniffed Digest authentication
credentials to call arbitrary telephone numbers or spoof caller ID
(aka "toll fraud and authentication forward attack").
