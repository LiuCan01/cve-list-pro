Heap-based buffer overflow in QEMU 0.8.2, as used in Xen and possibly
other products, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via
crafted data in the "net socket listen" option, aka QEMU "net socket"
heap overflow.  NOTE: some sources have used CVE-2007-1321 to refer to
this issue as part of "NE2000 network driver and the socket code," but
this is the correct identifier for the individual net socket listen
vulnerability.
