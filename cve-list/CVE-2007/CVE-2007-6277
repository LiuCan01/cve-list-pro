Multiple buffer overflows in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC
before 1.2.1 allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via large (1) Metadata Block Size, (2) VORBIS Comment String
Size, (3) Picture Metadata MIME-TYPE Size, (4) Picture Description
Size, (5) Picture Data Length, (6) Padding Length, and (7) PICTURE
Metadata width and height values in a .FLAC file, which result in a
heap-based overflow; and large (8) VORBIS Comment String Size Length,
(9) Picture MIME-Type, (10) Picture MIME-Type URL, and (11) Picture
Description Length values in a .FLAC file, which result in a
stack-based overflow.  NOTE: some of these issues may overlap
