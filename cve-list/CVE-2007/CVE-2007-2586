The FTP Server in Cisco IOS 11.3 through 12.4 does not properly check
user authorization, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code, and have other impact including reading startup-config, as
demonstrated by a crafted MKD command that involves access to a VTY
device and overflows a buffer, aka bug ID CSCek55259.
