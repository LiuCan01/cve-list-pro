** DISPUTED **

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the admin panel in
Django 0.96 allows remote attackers to change passwords of arbitrary
users via a request to admin/auth/user/1/password/.  NOTE: this issue
has been disputed by Debian, since product documentation includes a
recommendation for a CSRF protection module that is included with the
product.  However, CVE considers this an issue because the default
configuration does not use this module.
