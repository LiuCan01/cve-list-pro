** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in modules/file.php in Seir Anphin
allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a .. (dot
dot) in the a[filepath] parameter.  NOTE: a third party has disputed
this issue because the a array is populated by a database query before
use.
