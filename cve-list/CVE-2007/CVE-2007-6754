The ipalloc function in libc/stdlib/malloc.c in jemalloc in libc for
FreeBSD 6.4 and NetBSD does not properly allocate memory, which makes
it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related
attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, related to
"integer rounding and overflow" errors.
