** REJECT **

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Cisco IOS 12.x and IOS XR
allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated via the
"Bind Shell", "Reverse Shell", and "Two byte rootshell (Tiny Shell)"
attacks.  NOTE: the vendor and researcher agree that this issue does
not cross privilege boundaries, saying they do not "represent a
vulnerability."  The disclosure was intended to demonstrate techniques
for exploitation, which is not covered by CVE.
