** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in OpenPinboard
2.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the language parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the
developer and a third party, since the variable is set before use.
CVE analysis suggests that there is a small time window of risk before
the installation is complete.
