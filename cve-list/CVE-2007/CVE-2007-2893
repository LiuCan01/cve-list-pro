Heap-based buffer overflow in the bx_ne2k_c::rx_frame function in
iodev/ne2k.cc in the emulated NE2000 device in Bochs 2.3 allows local
users of the guest operating system to write to arbitrary memory
locations and gain privileges on the host operating system via vectors
that cause TXCNT register values to exceed the device memory size, aka
"RX Frame heap overflow."
