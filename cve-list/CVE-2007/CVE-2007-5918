Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in edit.php in the MS
TopSites add-on for PHP-Nuke does not verify that the uname parameter
matches the current account, which allows remote authenticated users
to change arbitrary accounts or change the SiteTitleName field as an
arbitrary user via a modified uname value in an edit action to
modules.php.
