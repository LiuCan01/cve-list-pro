The dynamic DNS update mechanism in the DNS Server service on
Microsoft Windows does not properly authenticate clients in certain
deployments or configurations, which allows remote attackers to change
DNS records for a web proxy server and conduct man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacks on web traffic, conduct pharming attacks by poisoning
DNS records, and cause a denial of service (erroneous name
resolution).
