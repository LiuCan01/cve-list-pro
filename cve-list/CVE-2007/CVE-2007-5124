Reference: BUGTRAQ:20070925 RE: CORE-2007-0817: Remote Command execution, HTML and JavaScript injection vulnerabilities in AOL's Instant Messaging software

Reference: MISC:http://aviv.raffon.net/2007/09/25/ReadyAIMFire.aspx

The embedded Internet Explorer server control in AOL Instant Messenger
(AIM) 6.5.3.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via unspecified web script or HTML in an instant
message, related to AIM's filtering of "specific tags and attributes"
and the lack of Local Machine Zone lockdown.  NOTE: this issue
reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-4901.
