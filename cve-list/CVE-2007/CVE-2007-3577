PHPIDS before 20070703 does not properly handle use of the substr
method in (1) document.location.search and (2) document.referrer; (3)
certain use of document.location.hash; (4) certain "window[eval" and
similar expressions; (5) certain Function expressions; (6) certain '='
expressions, as demonstrated by a 'whatever="something"' sequence; and
(7) certain "with" expressions, which allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script.
