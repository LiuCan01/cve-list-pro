Race condition in fileserver in OpenAFS 1.3.50 through 1.4.5 and 1.5.0
through 1.5.27 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(daemon crash) by simultaneously acquiring and giving back file
callbacks, which causes the handler for the GiveUpAllCallBacks RPC to
perform linked-list operations without the host_glock lock.
