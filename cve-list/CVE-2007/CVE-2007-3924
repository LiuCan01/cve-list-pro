Argument injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer, when
running on systems with Netscape installed and certain URIs
registered, allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser scripting
attacks and execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a
-chrome argument to the navigatorurl URI, which are inserted into the
command line that is created when invoking netscape.exe, a related
issue to CVE-2007-3670.  NOTE: there has been debate about whether the
issue is in Internet Explorer or Netscape. As of 20070713, it is CVE's
opinion that IE appears to not properly delimit the URL argument when
invoking Netscape; this issue could arise with other protocol handlers
in IE.
