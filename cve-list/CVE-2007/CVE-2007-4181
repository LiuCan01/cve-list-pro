** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in data/inc/theme.php in Pluck
4.3, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the dir parameter.  NOTE: A
reliable third party disputes this vulnerability because the
applicable include is within a function that does not receive the dir
parameter from an HTTP request.
