MailWasher Server before 2.2.1, when used with LDAP or Active
Directory (AD), does not properly handle blank passwords, which allows
remote attackers to access an arbitrary user account and read the spam
e-mail messages stored for that account, possibly related to the
LoginCheck::doPost function in mwi/servlet/Login.cpp.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
