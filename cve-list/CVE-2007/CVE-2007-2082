Direct static code injection vulnerability in admin/settings.php in
MyBlog 0.9.8 and earlier allows remote authenticated admin users to
inject arbitrary PHP code via the content parameter, which can be
executed by accessing index.php.  NOTE: a separate vulnerability could
be leveraged to make this issue exploitable by remote unauthenticated
attackers.
