ELinks before 0.11.3, when sending a POST request for an https URL,
appends the body and content headers of the POST request to the
CONNECT request in cleartext, which allows remote attackers to sniff
sensitive data that would have been protected by TLS.  NOTE: this
issue only occurs when a proxy is defined for https.
