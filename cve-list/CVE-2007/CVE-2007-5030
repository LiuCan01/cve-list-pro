Multiple integer overflows in Dibbler 0.6.0 allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via packets containing
options with large lengths, which trigger attempts at excessive memory
allocation, as demonstrated by (1) the TSrvMsg constructor in
SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp; the (2) TClntMsg, (3) TClntOptIAAddress, (4)
TClntOptIAPrefix, (5) TOptVendorSpecInfo, and (6) TOptOptionRequest
constructors; and the (7) TRelIfaceMgr::decodeRelayRepl, (8)
TRelMsg::decodeOpts, and (9) TSrvIfaceMgr::decodeRelayForw methods.
