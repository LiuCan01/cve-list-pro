The server in Toribash 2.71 and earlier does not properly handle long
commands, which allows remote attackers to trigger a protocol
violation in which data is sent to other clients without a required LF
character, as demonstrated by a SAY command.  NOTE: the security
impact of this violation is not clear, although it probably makes
exploitation of CVE-2007-4449 easier.
