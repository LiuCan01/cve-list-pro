Stack-based buffer overflow in the EDraw.OfficeViewer ActiveX control
in officeviewer.ocx in EDraw Office Viewer Component 5.3.220.1 and
earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long
strings in the first and second arguments to the FtpDownloadFile
method, a different vector than CVE-2007-4821 and CVE-2007-3169.
