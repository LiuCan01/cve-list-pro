Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Advanced Webhost Billing
System (AWBS) before 2.6.0, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified
vectors.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for XSS attacks that "bypass
AWBS's anti-XSS input validation."
