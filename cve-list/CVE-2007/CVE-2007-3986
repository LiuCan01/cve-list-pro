file.cgi in Secure Computing SecurityReporter (aka Network Security
Analyzer) 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a
name parameter that specifies the eventcache directory and a non-GIF
file, which causes the $dontvalidate variable to be set to true.
NOTE: a separate traversal vulnerability could be leveraged to
download arbitrary files.
