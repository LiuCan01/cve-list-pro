Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in functions.php in the
default theme in WordPress 2.2 allows remote authenticated
administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
PATH_INFO (REQUEST_URI) to wp-admin/themes.php, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2007-1622.  NOTE: this might not cross privilege
boundaries in some configurations, since the Administrator role has
the unfiltered_html capability.
