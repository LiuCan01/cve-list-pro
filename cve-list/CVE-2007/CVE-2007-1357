The atalk_sum_skb function in AppleTalk for Linux kernel 2.6.x before
2.6.21, and possibly 2.4.x, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) via an AppleTalk frame that is shorter than the
specified length, which triggers a BUG_ON call when an attempt is made
to perform a checksum.
