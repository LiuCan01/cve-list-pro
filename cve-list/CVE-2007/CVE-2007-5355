The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) feature in Microsoft Internet
Explorer 6 and 7, when a primary DNS suffix with three or more
components is configured, resolves an unqualified wpad hostname in a
second-level domain outside this configured DNS domain, which allows
remote WPAD servers to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
