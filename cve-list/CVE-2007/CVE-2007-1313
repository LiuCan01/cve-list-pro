NETxAutomation NETxEIB OPC Server before 3.0.1300 does not properly
validate OLE for Process Control (OPC) server handles, which allows
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
code via unspecified vectors involving the (1) IOPCSyncIO::Read, (2)
IOPCSyncIO::Write, (3) IOPCServer::AddGroup, (4)
IOPCServer::RemoveGroup, (5) IOPCCommon::SetClientName, and (6)
IOPCGroupStateMgt::CloneGroup functions, which allow access to
arbitrary memory. NOTE: the vectors might be limited to attackers with
physical access.
