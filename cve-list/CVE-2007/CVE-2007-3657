** DISPUTED **

Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service by opening multiple tabs in a popup window.  NOTE: this issue
has been disputed by third party researchers, stating that "this does
not crash on me, and I can't see a likely mechanism of action that
would lead to a DoS condition."
