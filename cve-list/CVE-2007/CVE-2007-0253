** DISPUTED **

Unspecified vulnerability in the grsecurity patch has unspecified
impact and remote attack vectors, a different vulnerability than the
expand_stack vulnerability from the Digital Armaments 20070110
pre-advisory.  NOTE: the grsecurity developer has disputed this issue,
stating that "the function they claim the vulnerability to be in is a
trivial function, which can, and has been, easily checked for any
supposed vulnerabilities."  The developer also cites a past disclosure
that was not proven.
