Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in index.php in
FlatNuke 2.6, and possibly 3, allows remote attackers to change the
password and privilege level of arbitrary accounts via the user
parameter and modified (1) regpass and (2) level parameters in a
none_Login action, as demonstrated by using a Flash object to
automatically make the request.
