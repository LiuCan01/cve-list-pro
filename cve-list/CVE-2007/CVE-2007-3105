Stack-based buffer overflow in the random number generator (RNG)
implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 might allow local
root users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by setting
the default wakeup threshold to a value greater than the output pool
size, which triggers writing random numbers to the stack by the pool
transfer function involving "bound check ordering".  NOTE: this issue
might only cross privilege boundaries in environments that have
granular assignment of privileges for root.
