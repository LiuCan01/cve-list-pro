Visual truncation vulnerability in Windows Privacy Tray (WinPT) 1.2.0
allows user-assisted remote attackers to install a key listed under
the wrong user ID, and possibly cause the user to encrypt a victim's
correspondence with this attacker-supplied key, via a key ID composed
of the attacker's user ID, space characters, an invalid WinPT message,
additional space characters, and the victim's user ID.
