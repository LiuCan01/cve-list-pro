The NantSys device 5.0.0.115 in Motorola netOctopus 5.1.2 build 1011
has weak permissions for the \.NantSys device interface
(nantsys.sys), which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service (system crash), as demonstrated by modifying the
SYSENTER_EIP_MSR CPU Model Specific Register (MSR) value.
