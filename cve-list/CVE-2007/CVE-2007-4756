Directory traversal vulnerability in the FTP client in Total Commander
before 7.02 allows remote FTP servers to create or overwrite arbitrary
files via ".." (dot dot backslash) sequences in a filename.  NOTE:
the ".." are not displayed when the user lists files.  NOTE: this can
be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
