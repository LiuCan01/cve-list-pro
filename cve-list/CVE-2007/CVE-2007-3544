Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in (1) wp-app.php and (2)
app.php in WordPress 2.2.1 and WordPress MU 1.2.3 allows remote
authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via
unspecified vectors, possibly related to the wp_postmeta table and the
use of custom fields in normal (non-attachment) posts.  NOTE: this
issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2007-3543.
