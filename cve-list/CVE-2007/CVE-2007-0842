The 64-bit versions of Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 standard library
(MSVCR80.DLL) time functions, including (1) localtime, (2)
localtime_s, (3) gmtime, (4) gmtime_s, (5) ctime, (6) ctime_s, (7)
wctime, (8) wctime_s, and (9) fstat, trigger an assertion error
instead of a NULL pointer or EINVAL when processing a time argument
later than Jan 1, 3000, which might allow context-dependent attackers
to cause a denial of service (application exit) via large time values.
NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design limitation of the
functions, and the vulnerability lies with any application that does
not validate arguments to these functions.  However, this behavior is
inconsistent with documentation, which does not list assertions as a
possible result of an error condition.
