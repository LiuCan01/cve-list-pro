Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the AXIS 2100
Network Camera 2.02 with firmware 2.43 and earlier allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the PATH_INFO
to the default URI associated with a directory, as demonstrated by (a)
the root directory and (b) the view/ directory; (2) parameters
associated with saved settings, as demonstrated by (c) the
conf_Network_HostName parameter on the Network page and (d) the
conf_Layout_OwnTitle parameter to ServerManager.srv; and (3) the query
string to ServerManager.srv, which is displayed on the logs page.
NOTE: an attacker can leverage a CSRF vulnerability to modify saved
settings.
