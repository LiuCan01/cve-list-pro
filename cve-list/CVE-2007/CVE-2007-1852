** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in 2BGal 3.1.1
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
lang_filename parameter to (1) index.php or (2) backupdb.inc.php in
admin/, or other unspecified files, different vectors than
CVE-2006-5505. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by CVE, since the
lang_filename variable is defined before it is used.
