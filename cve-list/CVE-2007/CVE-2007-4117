** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in
phpWebFileManager 0.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the PN_PathPrefix parameter.  NOTE: this issue is
disputed by a reliable third party, who demonstrates that
PN_PathPrefix is defined before use.
