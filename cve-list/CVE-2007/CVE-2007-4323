DenyHosts 2.6 does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows
remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file
and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the
sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client
protocol version identification containing an IP address string, a
different vector than CVE-2006-6301.
