A certain admin script in Inout Meta Search Engine sends a redirect to
the web browser but does not exit when administrative credentials are
missing, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code,
as demonstrated by a request to admin/create_engine.php followed by a
request to admin/generate_tabs.php.
