Variable overwrite vulnerability in groupit/base/groupit.start.inc in
Groupit 2.00b5 allows remote attackers to conduct remote file
inclusion attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code via arguments that
are written to $_GLOBALS, as demonstrated using a URL in the
c_basepath parameter to (1) content.php, (2) userprofile.php, (3)
password.php, (4) dispatch.php, and (5) deliver.php in html/, and
possibly (6) load.inc.php and related files.
