Remote file inclusion vulnerability in scripts2/objcache in cPanel
WebHost Manager (WHM) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a URL in the obj parameter.  NOTE: a third party claims that
this issue is not file inclusion because the contents are not parsed,
but the attack can be used to overwrite files in /var/cpanel/objcache
or provide unexpected web page contents.
