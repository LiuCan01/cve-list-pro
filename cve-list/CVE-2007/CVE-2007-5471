libgssapi before 0.6-13.7, as used by the ISC BIND named daemon in
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP 1, terminates upon an
initialization error, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (daemon exit) via a GSS-TSIG request.  NOTE: this issue
probably affects other daemons that attempt to initialize this library
within a chroot configuration or other invalid configuration.
