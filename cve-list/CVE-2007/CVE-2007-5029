Dibbler 0.6.0 does not verify that certain length parameters are
appropriate for buffer sizes, which allows remote attackers to trigger
a buffer over-read and cause a denial of service (daemon crash), as
demonstrated by incorrect behavior of the TSrvMsg constructor in
SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp when (1) reading the option code and option
length and (2) parsing options.
