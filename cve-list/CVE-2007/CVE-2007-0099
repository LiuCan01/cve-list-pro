Race condition in the msxml3 module in Microsoft XML Core Services
3.0, as used in Internet Explorer 6 and other applications, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (application crash) via many nested tags in an XML document in
an IFRAME, when synchronous document rendering is frequently disrupted
with asynchronous events, as demonstrated using a JavaScript timer,
which can trigger NULL pointer dereferences or memory corruption, aka
"MSXML Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
