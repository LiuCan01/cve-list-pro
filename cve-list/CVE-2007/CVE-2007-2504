** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in user/turbulence.php in PHP
Turbulence 0.0.1 alpha allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
PHP code via a URL in the GLOBALS[tcore] parameter.  NOTE: this
vulnerability is disputed by CVE and a reliable third party because a
direct request to user/turbulence.php triggers a fatal error before
inclusion.
