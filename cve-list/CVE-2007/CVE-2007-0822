umount, when running with the Linux 2.6.15 kernel on Slackware Linux
10.2, allows local users to trigger a NULL dereference and application
crash by invoking the program with a pathname for a USB pen drive that
was mounted and then physically removed, which might allow the users
to obtain sensitive information, including core file contents.
