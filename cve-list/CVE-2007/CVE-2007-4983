Directory traversal vulnerability in the JetAudio.Interface.1 ActiveX
control in JetFlExt.dll in jetAudio 7.0.3 Basic and 7.0.3.3016 allows
remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary local files via a
.. (dot dot backslash) in the second argument to the
DownloadFromMusicStore method.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for
code execution by overwriting JetAudio.exe, which is launched by the
control after completion of the method call.
