** DISPUTED **

Buffer overflow in the set_umask function in QFTP in LIBFtp 3.1-1
allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long -m argument.
NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because QFTP is not setuid, and it is
unlikely that there are web interfaces to QFTP that would accept
untrusted command line arguments.
