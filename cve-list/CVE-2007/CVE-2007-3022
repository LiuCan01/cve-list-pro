Symantec Reporting Server 1.0.197.0, and other versions before
1.0.224.0, as used in Symantec Client Security 3.1 and later, and
Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition (SAV CE) 10.1 and later, displays
the password hash for a user after a failed login attempt, which makes
it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force attacks.
