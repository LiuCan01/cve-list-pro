The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 20070504 does
not properly null terminate data, which allows remote attackers to
trigger loss of transmitted data, and possibly obtain sensitive
information (memory contents) or cause a denial of service
(application crash), by sending a frame that lacks a 0 byte.
