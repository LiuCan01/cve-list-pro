Multiple memory leaks in server/MaraDNS.c in MaraDNS before 1.2.12.06,
and 1.3.x before 1.3.05, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) via (1) reverse lookups or (2) requests
for records in a class other than Internet (IN), a different set of
affected versions than CVE-2007-3114 and CVE-2007-3116.
