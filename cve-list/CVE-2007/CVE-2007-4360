Unspecified vulnerability in Dell Remote Access Card 4 (DRAC4) with
firmware 1.50 Build 02.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (SSH daemon crash) via certain network traffic, as
demonstrated by an "nmap -O" scan with nmap 4.03, possibly related to
a Mocana (Mocanada) SSH vulnerability.
