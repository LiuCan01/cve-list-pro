The KDE HTML library (kdelibs), as used by Konqueror 3.5.5, does not
properly parse HTML comments, which allows remote attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and bypass some XSS protection
schemes by embedding certain HTML tags within a comment in a title
tag, a related issue to CVE-2007-0478.
