The chunk_split function in string.c in PHP 5.2.3 does not properly
calculate the needed buffer size due to precision loss when performing
integer arithmetic with floating point numbers, which has unknown
attack vectors and impact, possibly resulting in a heap-based buffer
overflow.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2872.
