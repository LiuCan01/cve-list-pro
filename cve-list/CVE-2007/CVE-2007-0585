include/debug.php in Webfwlog 0.92 and earlier, when register_globals
is enabled, allows remote attackers to obtain source code of files via
the conffile parameter.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.  It is likely that this issue can be
exploited to conduct directory traversal attacks.
