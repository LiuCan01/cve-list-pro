The SymTDI device driver (SYMTDI.SYS) in Symantec Norton Personal
Firewall 2006 9.1.1.7 and earlier, Internet Security 2005 and 2006,
AntiVirus Corporate Edition 3.0.x through 10.1.x, and other Norton
products, allows local users to cause a denial of service (system
crash) by sending crafted data to the driver's Device file, which
triggers invalid memory access, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2006-4855.
