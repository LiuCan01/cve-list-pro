** DISPUTED **

captcha.php in BellaBook (aka BellaBuffs) allows remote attackers to
obtain administrative privileges by sending the admin's username
(admin_name) in a pheap_login cookie.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this
vulnerability because authentication data is derived from the
admin_pass and secret variables, in addition to the admin_name; and
because the exploit code is designed for an unrelated application.
