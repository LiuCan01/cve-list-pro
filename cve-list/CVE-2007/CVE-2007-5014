Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in pSlash 0.70
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in (1)
the lvc_admin_dir parameter to
modules/visitors2/admin/view-archiver.inc.php or (2) the
lvc_include_dir parameter to modules/visitors2/include/menus.inc.php.
NOTE: the modules/visitors2/include/config.inc.php vector is already
covered by CVE-2006-4373.  NOTE: vector 1 is disputed by CVE because
PHP encounters a fatal instantiation error on a direct request for the
file, before reaching the include statement.
