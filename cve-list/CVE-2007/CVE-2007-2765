blockhosts.py in BlockHosts before 2.0.3 does not properly parse
daemon log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary deny
entries to the /etc/hosts.allow file and cause a denial of service by
adding arbitrary IP addresses to a daemon log file, as demonstrated by
logging in through ssh using a login name containing certain strings
with an IP address, which is not properly handled by a regular
expression, a related issue to CVE-2006-6301.
