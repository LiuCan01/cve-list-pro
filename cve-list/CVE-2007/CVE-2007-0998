The VNC server implementation in QEMU, as used by Xen and possibly
other environments, allows local users of a guest operating system to
read arbitrary files on the host operating system via unspecified
vectors related to QEMU monitor mode, as demonstrated by mapping files
to a CDROM device.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
