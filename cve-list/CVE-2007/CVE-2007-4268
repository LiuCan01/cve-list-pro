Integer signedness error in the Networking component in Apple Mac OS X
10.4 through 10.4.10 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via
a crafted AppleTalk message with a negative value, which satisfies a
signed comparison during mbuf allocation but is later interpreted as
an unsigned value, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
