Directory traversal vulnerability in inc/lang.php in sBLOG 0.7.3 Beta
allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files
via a .. (dot dot) in the conf_lang_default parameter, as demonstrated
by injecting PHP sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which
is then included by inc/lang.php.
