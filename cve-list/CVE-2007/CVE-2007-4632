Cisco IOS 12.2E, 12.2F, and 12.2S places a "no login" line into the
VTY configuration when an administrator makes certain changes to a (1)
VTY/AUX or (2) CONSOLE setting on a device without AAA enabled, which
allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and obtain a terminal
session, a different vulnerability than CVE-1999-0293 and
CVE-2005-2105.
