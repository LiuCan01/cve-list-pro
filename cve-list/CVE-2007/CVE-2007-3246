The do_set_password function in modules/chanserv/set.c in IRC Services
before 5.0.60 preserves channel founder privileges across a channel
password change (ChanServ SET PASSWORD), which allows remote
authenticated users to obtain the new password through automated
e-mail, or perform privileged actions without knowing the new
password.
