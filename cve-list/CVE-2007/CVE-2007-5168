Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ClanLite
1.23.01.2005 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
a URL in the root_path parameter to (1) modules/serveur_jeux.php or
(2) conf/conf-php.php.  NOTE: vector 1 is disputed by CVE because the
require_once is only reached when a certain constant has already been
defined.
