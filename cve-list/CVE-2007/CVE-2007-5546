Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in TIBCO SmartPGM FX allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (service stop and file-transfer outage) via unspecified
vectors.  NOTE: as of 20071016, the only disclosure is a vague
pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, since it is from
a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for
tracking purposes.
