cp.php in DeluxeBB 1.09 does not verify that the membercookie
parameter corresponds to the authenticated member during a profile
update, which allows remote authenticated users to change the e-mail
addresses of arbitrary accounts via a modified membercookie parameter,
a different vector than CVE-2006-4078.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for
administrative access by requesting password-reset e-mail through a
lostpw action to misc.php.
