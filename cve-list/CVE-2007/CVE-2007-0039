The Exchange Collaboration Data Objects (EXCDO) functionality in
Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 SP3, 2003 SP1 and SP2, and 2007 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an Internet
Calendar (iCal) file containing multiple X-MICROSOFT-CDO-MODPROPS
(MODPROPS) properties in which the second MODPROPS is longer than the
first, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference and an unhandled
exception.
