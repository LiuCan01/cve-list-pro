Microsoft Office 2007 12.0.6015.5000 and MSO 12.0.6017.5000 do not
sign the metadata of Office Open XML (OOXML) documents, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to modify Dublin Core metadata fields, as
demonstrated by the (1) LastModifiedBy and (2) creator fields in
docProps/core.xml in the OOXML ZIP container.
