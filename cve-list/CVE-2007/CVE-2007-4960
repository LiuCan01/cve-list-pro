Argument injection vulnerability in the Linden Lab Second Life
secondlife:// protocol handler, as used in Internet Explorer and
possibly Firefox, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive

-autologin and -loginuri arguments, which cause the handler to post
login credentials and software installation details to an arbitrary
URL.
