** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in tracking.php in Trackeur 1
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
header parameter.  NOTE: CVE and a third party dispute this
vulnerability because header is defined before use.  The researcher is
known to be unreliable.
