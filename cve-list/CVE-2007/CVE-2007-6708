Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities on the
Cisco Linksys WAG54GS Wireless-G ADSL Gateway with 1.01.03 and earlier
firmware allow remote attackers to perform actions as administrators
via an arbitrary valid request to an administrative URI, as
demonstrated by (1) a Restore Factory Defaults action using the
mtenRestore parameter to setup.cgi and (2) creation of a user account
using the sysname parameter to setup.cgi.
