Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in

allow remote attackers to perform certain actions as arbitrary users,
as demonstrated by (1) modifying data or (2) canceling a subscription.
NOTE: it is not clear whether IDE Group updates all DRS installations
in its role as an application service provider. If so, then this issue
should not be included in CVE.
