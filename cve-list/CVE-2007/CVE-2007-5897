Buffer overflow in MDSYS.SDO_CS in Oracle Database Server 8iR3, 9iR1,
9iR2 up to 9.2.0.6, and 10gR1 up to 10.1.0.4 allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute
arbitrary code via the TRANSFORM function.  NOTE: this issue might
already be covered by CVE-2007-5515, CVE-2007-5509, or CVE-2007-5505,
but there are insufficient details to be sure.
