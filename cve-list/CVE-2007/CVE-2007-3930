Interpretation conflict between Microsoft Internet Explorer and
DocuWiki before 2007-06-26b allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary JavaScript and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
when spellchecking UTF-8 encoded messages via the spell_utf8test
function in lib/exe/spellcheck.php, which triggers HTML document
identification and script execution by Internet Explorer even though
the Content-Type header is text/plain.
