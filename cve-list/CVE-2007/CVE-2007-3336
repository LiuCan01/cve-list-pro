Multiple "pointer overwrite" vulnerabilities in Ingres database server
2006 9.0.4, r3, 2.6, and 2.5, as used in multiple CA (formerly
Computer Associates) products, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by sending certain TCP data at different times to the
Ingres Communications Server Process (iigcc), which calls the (1)
QUinsert or (2) QUremove functions with attacker-controlled input.
