The RFC_START_PROGRAM function in the SAP RFC Library 6.40 and 7.00
before 20061211 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information (external RFC server configuration data) via unspecified
vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-6010.  NOTE: This
information is based upon a vague initial disclosure. Details will be
updated after the grace period has ended.
