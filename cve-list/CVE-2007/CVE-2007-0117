DiskManagementTool in the DiskManagement.framework 92.29 on Mac OS X
10.4.8 does not properly validate Bill of Materials (BOM) files, which
allows attackers to gain privileges via a BOM file under
/Library/Receipts/, which triggers arbitrary file permission changes
upon execution of a diskutil permission repair operation.
