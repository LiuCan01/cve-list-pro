inc_newuser.asp in Hosting Controller 6.1 Hot fix 3.3 and earlier
allows remote authenticated users to change the permissions of
directories named (1) db, (2) www, (3) Special, and (4) log at
arbitrary locations under the web root via a modified Dirroot
parameter in an AddUser action to accounts/AccountActions.asp.  NOTE:
this can be leveraged for remote code execution by changing the
permissions of Forumdb, which is configured for execution of ASP
scripts with administrative privileges, and then uploading a script to
Forumdb.
