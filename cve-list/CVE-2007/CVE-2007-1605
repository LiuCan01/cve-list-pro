w-Agora (Web-Agora) allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via a request to rss.php with an invalid (1) site or (2)
bn parameter, (3) a certain value of the site[] parameter, or (4) an
empty value of the bn[] parameter; a request to index.php with a
certain value of the (5) site[] or (6) sort[] parameter; (7) a request
to profile.php with an empty value of the site[] parameter; or a
request to search.php with (8) an empty value of the bn[] parameter or
a certain value of the (9) pattern[] or (10) search_date[] parameter,
which reveal the path in various error messages, probably related to
variable type inconsistencies.  NOTE: the bn[] parameter to index.php
is already covered by CVE-2007-0606.1.
