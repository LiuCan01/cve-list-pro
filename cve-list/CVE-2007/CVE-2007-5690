** DISPUTED **

Buffer overflow in sethdlc.c in the Asterisk Zaptel 1.4.5.1 might
allow local users to gain privileges via a long device name (interface
name) in the ifr_name field.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue,
stating that the application requires root access, so privilege
boundaries are not crossed.
