Integer overflow in eXtremail 2.1.1 and earlier allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service, and possibly execute arbitrary
code, via a long USER command containing "%s" sequences to the pop3
port (110/tcp), which are expanded to "%%s" before being used in the
memmove function, possibly due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2001-1078.
