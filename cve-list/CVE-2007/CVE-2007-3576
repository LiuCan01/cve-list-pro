** DISPUTED **

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 executes web script from URIs of
arbitrary scheme names ending with the "script" character sequence,
using the (1) vbscript: handler for scheme names with 7 through 9
characters, and the (2) javascript: handler for scheme names with 10
or more characters, which might allow remote attackers to bypass
certain XSS protection schemes.  NOTE: other researchers dispute the
significance of this issue, stating "this only works when typed in the
address bar."
