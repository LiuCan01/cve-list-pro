** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in preview.php in the
swMenuFree (com_swmenufree) 4.6 component for Joomla! allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: a reliable third party
disputes this issue because preview.php tests a certain constant to
prevent direct requests.
