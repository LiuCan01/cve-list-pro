** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in MobilePublisherphp 1.1.2
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
auth_method parameter to (1) index.php, (2) list.php, (3)
postreview.php, (4) reindex.php, (5) sections.php, (6) templates.php,
(7) userinfo.php, (8) users.php, and (9) view.php in admin/.  NOTE:
this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party, who states
that $auth_method is defined before use.
