Multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in w-Agora
(Web-Agora) allow remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP
code (1) via a forum message with an attached file, which is stored
under forums/hello/hello/notes/ or (2) by using browse_avatar.php to
upload a file with a double extension, as demonstrated by .php.jpg.
