Integer signedness error in the (1) cab_unstore and (2) cab_extract
functions in libclamav/cab.c in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) before 0.90.2
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted CHM
file that contains a negative integer, which passes a signed
comparison and leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.
