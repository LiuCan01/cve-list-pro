Papoo CMS 3.6, and possibly earlier, does not verify user privileges
when accessing the backend administration plugins, which allows remote
authenticated users to (1) read the entire database by accessing the
database backup plugin via a devtools/templates/newdump_backend.html
argument in the template parameter to interna/plugin.php, (2) create
plugins, (3) remove plugins, (4) enable debug mode, and have other
unspecified impact.
