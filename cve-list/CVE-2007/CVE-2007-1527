The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista does not verify that an IP
address in a TLV type 0x07 field in a HELLO packet corresponds to a
valid IP address for the local network, which allows remote attackers
to trick users into communicating with an external host by sending a
HELLO packet with the MW characteristic and a spoofed TLV type 0x07
field, aka the "Spoof and Management URL IP Redirect" attack.
