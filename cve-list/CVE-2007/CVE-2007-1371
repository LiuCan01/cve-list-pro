Multiple buffer overflows in Conquest 8.2a and earlier (1) allow local
users to gain privileges by querying a metaserver that sends a long
server entry processed by metaGetServerList and allow remote
metaservers to execute arbitrary code via a long server entry
processed by metaGetServerList; (2) allow attackers to have an unknown
impact by exceeding the configured number of metaservers; and allow
remote attackers to corrupt memory via a SP_CLIENTSTAT packet with
certain values of (3) unum or (4) snum, different vulnerabilities than
CVE-2003-0933.
