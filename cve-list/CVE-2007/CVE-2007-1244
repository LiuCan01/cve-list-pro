Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the AdminPanel in
WordPress 2.1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to perform
privileged actions as administrators, as demonstrated using the delete
action in wp-admin/post.php.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to
perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and steal cookies via the
post parameter.
