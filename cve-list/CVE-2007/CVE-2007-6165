Mail in Apple Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.1) allows user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via an AppleDouble attachment
containing an apparently-safe file type and script in a resource fork,
which does not warn the user that a separate program is going to be
executed.  NOTE: this is a regression error related to CVE-2006-0395.
