The "You are not allowed..." error handler in XWiki 1.0 B1 and 1.0 B2
associates the doc variable with the entire document content and
metadata regardless of a user's view rights, which allows remote
authenticated users to read arbitrary documents via a custom skin that
prints the content attribute of the doc variable.
