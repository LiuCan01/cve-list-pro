Google Desktop allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute
arbitrary programs via a man-in-the-middle attack that injects
JavaScript, a www.google.com search IFRAME, and a META
HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" that targets a www.google.com search for a local
.exe file, which is displayed in the "results stored on your computer"
portion of the search results, and when clicked invokes Google Desktop
to execute this file.
