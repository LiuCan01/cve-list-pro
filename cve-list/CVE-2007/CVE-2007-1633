Directory traversal vulnerability in bbcode_ref.php in the Giorgio
Ciranni Splatt Forum 4.0 RC1 module for PHP-Nuke allows remote
attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot
dot) in the name parameter, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences
into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by
bbcode_ref.php.
