Multiple buffer overflows in WinImage 8.0.8000 allow user-assisted
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a FAT image that
contains long directory names in a deeply nested directory structure,
which triggers (1) a stack-based buffer overflow during extraction, or
(2) a heap-based buffer overflow during traversal.
