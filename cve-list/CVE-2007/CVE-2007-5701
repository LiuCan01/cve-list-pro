Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the Certificate Authority (CA)
in IBM Lotus Domino before 7.0.3 allows local users, or attackers with
physical access, to obtain sensitive information (passwords) when an
administrator enters a "ca activate" or "ca unlock" command with any
uppercase character, which bypasses a blacklist designed to suppress
password logging, resulting in cleartext password disclosure in the
console log and Admin panel.
