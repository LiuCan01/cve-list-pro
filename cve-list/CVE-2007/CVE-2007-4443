The UCC dedicated server for the Unreal engine, possibly 2003 and
2004, on Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(continuous beep and server slowdown) via a string containing many
0x07 characters in (1) a request to the images/ directory, (2) the
Content-Type field, (3) a HEAD request, and possibly other unspecified
vectors.
