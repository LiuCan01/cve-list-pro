Buffer overflow in Winzip32.exe in WinZip 9.0 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a long command line argument.  NOTE: this issue may
cross privilege boundaries if an application automatically invokes
Winzip32.exe for untrusted input filenames, as in the case of a file
upload application.  NOTE: The provenance of this information is
unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
