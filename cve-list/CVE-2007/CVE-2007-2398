Apple Safari 3.0.1 beta (522.12.12) on Windows allows remote attackers
to modify the window title and address bar while filling the main
window with arbitrary content by setting the location bar and using
setTimeout() to create an event that modifies the window content,
which could facilitate phishing attacks.
