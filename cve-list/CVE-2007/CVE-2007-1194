Norman SandBox Analyzer does not use the proper range for Interrupt
Descriptor Table (IDT) entries, which allows local users to determine
that the local machine is an emulator, or a similar environment not
based on a physical Intel processor, which allows attackers to produce
malware that is more difficult to analyze.
