Multiple direct static code injection vulnerabilities in MyCMS 0.9.8
and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into
(1) a _score.txt file via the score parameter, or (2) a _setby.txt
file via a login cookie, which is then included by games.php.  NOTE:
programs that use games.php might include (a) snakep.php, (b)
tetrisp.php, and possibly other site-specific files.
