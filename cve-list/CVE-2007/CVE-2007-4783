The iconv_substr function in PHP 5.2.4 and earlier allows
context-dependent attackers to cause (1) a denial of service
(application crash) via a long string in the charset parameter,
probably also requiring a long string in the str parameter; or (2) a
denial of service (temporary application hang) via a long string in
the str parameter.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most
web server environments that support multiple threads, unless these
issues can be demonstrated for code execution.
