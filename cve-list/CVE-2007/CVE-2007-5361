The Communication Server in Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise 7.1 and
earlier caches an IP address during a TFTP request from an IP Touch
phone, and uses this IP address as the destination for all subsequent
VoIP packets to this phone, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (loss of audio) or intercept voice communications
via a crafted TFTP request containing the phone's MAC address in the
filename.
