Directory traversal vulnerability in the PersistenceService in Sun
Java Web Start in JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 11 and earlier, and Java Web
Start in SDK and JRE 1.4.2_13 and earlier, for Windows allows remote
attackers to perform unauthorized actions via an application that
grants file overwrite privileges to itself.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged to execute arbitrary code by overwriting a .java.policy
file.
