Integer overflow in the _NtSetValueKey function in klif.sys in
Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Anti-Virus for Workstations, Anti-Virus for File
Server 6.0, and Internet Security 6.0 before Maintenance Pack 2 build
6.0.2.614 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a large, unsigned "data size argument," which results in a heap
overflow.
