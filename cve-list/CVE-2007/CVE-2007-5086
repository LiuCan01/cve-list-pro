Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV) and Internet Security 7.0 build 125 do not
properly validate certain parameters to System Service Descriptor
Table (SSDT) and Shadow SSDT function handlers, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (crash) via the (1)
NtUserSendInput, (2) LoadLibraryA, (3) NtOpenProcess, (4)
NtOpenThread, (5) NtTerminateProcess, (6) NtUserFindWindowEx, and (7)
NtUserBuildHwndList kernel SSDT hooks in kylif.sys; the (8)
NtDuplicateObject (DuplicateHandle) kernel SSDT hook; and possibly
other kernel SSDT hooks.  NOTE: the NtCreateSection vector is covered
by CVE-2007-5043.1.  NOTE: the vendor disputes that the DuplicateHandle
vector is a vulnerability in their code, stating that "it is not an
error in our code, but an obscure method for manipulating standard
Windows routines to circumvent our self-defense mechanisms."
