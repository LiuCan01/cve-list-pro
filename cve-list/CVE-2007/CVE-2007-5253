c32web.exe in McMurtrey/Whitaker Cart32 before 6.4 allows remote
attackers to read arbitrary files via the ImageName parameter in a
GetImage action, by appending a NULL byte (%00) sequence followed by
an image file extension, as demonstrated by a request for a
".txt%00.gif" file.  NOTE: this might be a directory traversal
vulnerability.
