Apple Safari for Windows 3.0.3 and earlier does not prompt the user
before downloading a file, which allows remote attackers to download
arbitrary files to the desktop of a client system via certain HTML, as
demonstrated by a filename in the DATA attribute of an OBJECT element.
NOTE: it could be argued that this is not a vulnerability because a
dangerous file is not actually launched, but as of 2007, it is
generally accepted that web browsers should prompt users before saving
dangerous content.
