Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Xythos
Enterprise Document Manager (XEDM) before 5.0.25.8, and 6.x before
6.0.46.1, allow remote authenticated users to execute commands as
arbitrary users via (1) a saved Workflow name or (2) the Content-Type
HTTP header.  NOTE: item 2 also affects the same version numbers of
Xythos Digital Locker (XDL). One or both vectors might also affect
Xythos WebFile Server.
