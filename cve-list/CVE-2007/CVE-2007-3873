Stack-based buffer overflow in vstlib32.dll 1.2.0.1012 in the SSAPI
Engine 5.0.0.1066 through 5.2.0.1012 in Trend Micro AntiSpyware 3.5
and PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007 15.0 through 15.3, when the Venus
Spy Trap (VST) feature is enabled, allows local users to cause a
denial of service (service crash) or execute arbitrary code via a file
with a long pathname, which triggers the overflow during a
ReadDirectoryChangesW callback notification.
