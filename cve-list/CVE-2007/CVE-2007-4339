Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in PHPCentral Poll
Script 1.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the _SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT] parameter in (1) poll.php and (2)
pollarchive.php.  NOTE: a reliable third party states that this issue
is resultant from a variable extraction error in functions.php.
