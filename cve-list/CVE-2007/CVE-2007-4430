Unspecified vulnerability in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (device
restart and BGP routing table rebuild) via certain regular expressions
in a "show ip bgp regexp" command.  NOTE: unauthenticated remote
attacks are possible in environments with anonymous telnet and Looking
Glass access.
