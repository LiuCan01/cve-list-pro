Race condition in the NeatUpload ASP.NET component 1.2.11 through
1.2.16, 1.1.18 through 1.1.23, and trunk.379 through trunk.445 allows
remote attackers to obtain other clients' HTTP responses via multiple
simultaneous requests, which triggers multiple calls to
HttpWorkerRequest.FlushResponse for the same HttpWorkerRequest object
and causes a buffer to be reused for a different request.
