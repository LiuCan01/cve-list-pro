** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in stat12 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
langpath parameter.  NOTE: this issue was published by an unreliable
researcher, and there is little information to determine which product
is actually affected.  This is probably an invalid report based on
analysis by CVE and a third party.
