The NFS client implementation in the kernel in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) 3, when a filesystem is mounted with the noacl option,
checks permissions for the open system call via vfs_permission (mode
bits) data rather than an NFS ACCESS call to the server, which allows
local client processes to obtain a false success status from open
calls that the server would deny, and possibly obtain sensitive
information about file permissions on the server, as demonstrated in a
root_squash environment.  NOTE: it is uncertain whether any scenarios
involving this issue cross privilege boundaries.
