Heap-based buffer overflow in Kakadu kdu_v32m.dll in Yahoo! Messenger
8.1.0.413 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a certain length field in JPEG2000 data, as
demonstrated by sending an "invite to view my webcam" request, and
then injecting a DLL into the attacker's peer Yahoo! Messenger
application when this request is accepted.
