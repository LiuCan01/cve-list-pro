The installation process for Oracle 10g and llg uses accounts with
default passwords, which allows remote attackers to obtain login
access by connecting to the Listener.  NOTE: at the end of the
installation, if performed using the Database Configuration Assistant
(DBCA), most accounts are disabled or their passwords are changed.
