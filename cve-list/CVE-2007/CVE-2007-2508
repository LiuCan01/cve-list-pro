Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Trend Micro ServerProtect
5.58 before Security Patch 2 Build 1174 allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via crafted data to (1) TCP port 5168, which
triggers an overflow in the CAgRpcClient::CreateBinding function in
the AgRpcCln.dll library in SpntSvc.exe; or (2) TCP port 3628, which
triggers an overflow in EarthAgent.exe.  NOTE: both issues are
reachable via TmRpcSrv.dll.
