** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in jambook.php in the Jambook
(com_Jambook) 1.0 beta7 module for Mambo and Joomla! allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
by a reliable third party because the jambook.php protects against
direct request.
