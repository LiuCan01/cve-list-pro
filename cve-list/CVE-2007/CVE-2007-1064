Cisco Secure Services Client (CSSC) 4.x, Trust Agent 1.x and 2.x,
Cisco Security Agent (CSA) 5.0 and 5.1 (when a vulnerable Trust Agent
has been deployed), and the Meetinghouse AEGIS SecureConnect Client do
not drop privileges when the help facility in the supplicant GUI is
invoked, which allows local users to gain privileges, aka CSCsf14120.
