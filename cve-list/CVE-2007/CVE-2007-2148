Direct static code injection vulnerability in admin/save.php in
Stephen Craton (aka WiredPHP) Chatness 2.5.3 and earlier allows remote
authenticated administrators to inject PHP code into .html files via
the html parameter, as demonstrated by head.html and foot.html, which
are included and executed upon a direct request for index.php.  NOTE: a
separate vulnerability could be leveraged to make this issue
exploitable by remote unauthenticated attackers.
