fail2ban 0.8 and earlier does not properly parse sshd log files, which
allows remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny
file and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to
the sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client
protocol version identification containing an IP address string, a
different vector than CVE-2006-6302.
