Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in SineCMS 2.3.4 and earlier
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the
id parameter to mods/Calendar/index.php, accessed through a Calendar
info action to mods.php; the id parameter to admin/mods_adm.php in a
(2) Guestbook modifica or (3) Calendar modify action; or the (4) mese
or (5) anno parameter to admin/mods_adm.php in a Calendar action.
NOTE: the component for vectors 2 through 5 might be limited to
administrators.
