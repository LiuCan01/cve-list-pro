Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the OpenWiki
(formerly JD-Wiki) component (com_jd-wiki) 1.0.2, and possibly
earlier, for Joomla! allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter to (1)
dwpage.php or (2) wantedpages.php, different vectors than
CVE-2006-4074.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown;
