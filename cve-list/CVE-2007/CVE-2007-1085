Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Desktop allows
remote attackers to bypass protection schemes and inject arbitrary web
script or HTML, and possibly gain full access to the system, by using
an XSS vulnerability in google.com to extract the signature for the
internal web server, then calling the "under" parameter in Advanced
Search with the proper signature.
