Multiple integer overflows in Media Player Classic (MPC) 6.4.9.0 and
earlier, as used standalone and in mympc (aka CD-Storm) 1.0.0.1,
StormPlayer 1.0.4, and possibly other products, allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a .avi file with certain large "indx truck size"
and nEntriesInuse values.
