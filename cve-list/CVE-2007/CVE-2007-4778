Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the content component
(com_content) in Joomla! 1.5 Beta1, Beta2, and RC1 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the filter parameter
in an archive action to (1) archive.php, (2) category.php, or (3)
section.php in models/.  NOTE: this may be the same as CVE-2007-4777.
