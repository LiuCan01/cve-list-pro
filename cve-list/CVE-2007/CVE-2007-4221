Multiple buffer overflows in Motorola Timbuktu Pro before 8.6.5 for
Windows allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a long user name and
(2) certain malformed requests; and (3) allow remote Timbuktu servers
to have an unknown impact via a malformed HELLO response, related to
the Scanner component and possibly related to a malformed computer
name.
