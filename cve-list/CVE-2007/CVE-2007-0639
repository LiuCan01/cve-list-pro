Multiple static code injection vulnerabilities in error.php in GuppY
4.5.16 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code
into a .inc file in the data/ directory via (1) a REMOTE_ADDR cookie
or (2) a cookie specifying an element of the msg array with an error
number in the first dimension and 0 in the second dimension, as
demonstrated by msg[999][0].
