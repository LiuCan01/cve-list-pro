PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in visitor.php in Butterfly
online visitors counter 1.08, when used with certain older versions of
PHP with improper SERVER superglobal handling, allows remote attackers
to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the _SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]
parameter.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is caused
by a problem in PHP and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then
this should not be treated as a vulnerability in Butterfly online
visitors counter.
