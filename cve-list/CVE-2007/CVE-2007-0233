wp-trackback.php in WordPress 2.0.6 and earlier does not properly
unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with
a value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the tb_id
parameter.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to
a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix
should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a
vulnerability in WordPress.
