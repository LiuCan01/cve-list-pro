Multiple integer overflows in ImageMagick before 6.3.3-5 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted DCM image, which
results in a heap-based overflow in the ReadDCMImage function, or (2)
the (a) colors or (b) comments field in a crafted XWD image, which
results in a heap-based overflow in the ReadXWDImage function,
different issues than CVE-2007-1667.
