** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in Maian Weblog
3.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the path_to_folder parameter.  NOTE: this issue was disputed by a
third party researcher, since the path_to_folder variable is
initialized before use.
