Off-by-one error in the do_login_loop function in
libwzd-core/wzd_login.c in wzdftpd 0.8.0, 0.8.2, and possibly other
versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) via a long USER command that triggers a stack-based buffer
overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
