make_catalog_backup in Bacula 2.2.5, and probably earlier, sends a
MySQL password as a command line argument, and sometimes transmits
cleartext e-mail containing this command line, which allows
context-dependent attackers to obtain the password by listing the
process and its arguments, or by sniffing the network.
