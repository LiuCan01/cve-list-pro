The InternalUnpackBits function in Apple QuickDraw, as used by
Quicktime 7.1.3 and other applications on Mac OS X 10.4.8 and earlier,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT file
that triggers memory corruption in the _GetSrcBits32ARGB function.
NOTE: this issue might overlap CVE-2007-0462.
