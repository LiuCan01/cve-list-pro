Interpretation conflict in ASP.NET in Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0,
1.1, and 2.0 for Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, and Vista allows
remote attackers to access configuration files and obtain sensitive
information, and possibly bypass security mechanisms that try to
constrain the final substring of a string, via %00 characters, related
to use of %00 as a string terminator within POSIX functions but a data
character within .NET strings, aka "Null Byte Termination
Vulnerability."
