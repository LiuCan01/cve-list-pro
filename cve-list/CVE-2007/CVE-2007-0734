fsck, as used by the AirPort Disk feature of the AirPort Extreme Base
Station with 802.11n before Firmware Update 7.1, and by Apple Mac OS X
10.3.9 through 10.4.9, does not properly enforce password protection
of a USB hard drive, which allows context-dependent attackers to list
arbitrary directories or execute arbitrary code, resulting from memory
corruption.
