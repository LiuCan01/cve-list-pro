The Terminal Server in Microsoft Windows 2003 Server, when using TLS,
allows remote attackers to bypass SSL and self-signed certificate
requirements, downgrade the server security, and possibly conduct
man-in-the-middle attacks via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated
using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 6.0 client.  NOTE: a third
party claims that the vendor may have fixed this in approximately
2006.
