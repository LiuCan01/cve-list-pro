Cross-zone scripting vulnerability in the DOM templates (domplates)
used by the console.log function in the Firebug extension before 1.04
for Mozilla Firefox allows remote attackers to bypass zone
restrictions, read arbitrary file:// URIs, or execute arbitrary code
in the browser chrome by overwriting the toString function via a
certain function declaration, related to incorrect identification of
anonymous JavaScript functions, a different issue than CVE-2007-1878.
