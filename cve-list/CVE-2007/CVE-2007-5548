Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Command EXEC in Cisco IOS
allow local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors, aka (1)
PSIRT-0474975756 and (2) PSIRT-0388256465.  NOTE: as of 20071016, the
only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable

being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
