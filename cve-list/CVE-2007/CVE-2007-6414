admin/administrator.php in Adult Script 1.6 and earlier sends a
redirect to the web browser but does not exit, which allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication and obtain administrative
credentials via a direct request.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for
arbitrary code execution through a request to
admin/videolinks_view.php.
