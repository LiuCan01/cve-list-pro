Stack-based buffer overflow in the AskJeevesToolBar.SettingsPlugin.1
ActiveX control in askBar.dll in IAC Search & Media ask.com Ask
Toolbar 4.0.2.53 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long ShortFormat property value.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: the
researcher claims that this is the same as CVE-2007-5108, but there is
insufficient detail for CVE-2007-5108 to be certain.
