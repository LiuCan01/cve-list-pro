PGP Desktop before 9.5.1 does not validate data objects received over
the (1) pipepgpserv named pipe for PGPServ.exe or the (2)
pipepgpsdkserv named pipe for PGPsdkServ.exe, which allows remote
authenticated users to gain privileges by sending a data object
representing an absolute pointer, which causes code execution at the
corresponding address.
