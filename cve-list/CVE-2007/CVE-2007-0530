** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Advanced
Guestbook 2.4.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the include_path parameter to (1) index.php, (2)
addentry.php, or (3) picture.php, a different set of vectors than
CVE-2006-5804.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third party
researchers, stating that the include_path variable is instantiated
before use.
