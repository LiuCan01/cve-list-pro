ProSecurity 1.40 Beta 2 does not properly validate certain parameters
to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function handlers, which
allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
gain privileges via kernel SSDT hooks for Windows Native API functions
including (1) NtCreateKey, (2) NtDeleteFile, (3) NtLoadDriver, (4)
NtOpenSection, and (5) NtSetSystemTime.
