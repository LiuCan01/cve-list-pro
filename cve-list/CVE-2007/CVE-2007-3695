Buffer overflow in LICRCMD.EXE in CA ERwin Process Modeler (formerly
AllFusion Process Modeler) 7.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a long filename.  NOTE: the researcher does not suggest any
circumstances in which the filename would come from an untrusted
source, and therefore perhaps the issue does not cross privilege
boundaries and should not be included in CVE.
