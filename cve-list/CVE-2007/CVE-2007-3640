Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR, aka Apollo) allows context-dependent
attackers to modify arbitrary files within an executing .air file
(compiled AIR application) and perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks, as demonstrated by an application that modifies an HTML file
inside itself via JavaScript that uses an APPEND open operation and
the writeUTFBytes function.  NOTE: this may be an intended consequence
of the AIR permission model; if so, then perhaps this issue should not
be included in CVE.
