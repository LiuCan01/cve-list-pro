SimpGB 1.46.02 stores sensitive information under the web root with
insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to (1)
obtain sensitive configuration information via a direct request for
admin/cfginfo.php; and (2) download arbitrary .inc files via a direct
request, as demonstrated by admin/includes/dbtables.inc.
