Format string vulnerability in the logging function in the Oracle OPMN
daemon, as used on Oracle Enterprise Grid Console server 10.2.0.1,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string
specifiers in the URI in an HTTP request to port 6003, aka Oracle
reference number 6296175.  NOTE: this might be the same issue as
CVE-2007-0282 or CVE-2007-0280, but there are insufficient details to
be sure.
