Buffer overflow in the GDI engine in Windows Live Messenger, as used
for Windows MSN Live 8.1, allows user-assisted remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash or system crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code by placing a malformed file in a new
folder under the Sharing Folders path, and triggering a synchronize
operation through the Windows MSN Live online service, possibly
related to extended file attributes and possibly related to an
incomplete fix for MS07-046, as demonstrated by a (1) .jpg, (2) .gif,
(3) .wmf, (4) .doc, or (5) .ico file.
