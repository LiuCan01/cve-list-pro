Buffer overflow in pirs32.exe in Poslovni informator Republike
Slovenije (PIRS) 2007 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long
search string in certain fields in the GUI.  NOTE: this may cross
privilege boundaries if PIRS is used by data-entry workers who do not
have full access to the underlying Windows environment.
