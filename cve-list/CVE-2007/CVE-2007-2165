The Auth API in ProFTPD before 20070417, when multiple simultaneous
authentication modules are configured, does not require that the
module that checks authentication is the same as the module that
retrieves authentication data, which might allow remote attackers to
bypass authentication, as demonstrated by use of SQLAuthTypes
Plaintext in mod_sql, with data retrieved from /etc/passwd.
