The RFC_SET_REG_SERVER_PROPERTY function in the SAP RFC Library 6.40
and 7.00 before 20070109 implements an option for exclusive access to
an RFC server, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (client lockout) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: This
information is based upon a vague initial disclosure. Details will be
updated after the grace period has ended.
