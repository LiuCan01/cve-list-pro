Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in phpChess
Community Edition 2.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in (1) the config parameter to includes/language.php,
or the Root_Path parameter to (2) layout_admin_cfg.php, (3)
layout_cfg.php, or (4) layout_t_top.php in skins/phpchess/.  NOTE:
vector 1 has been disputed by CVE, since the code is defined within a
function that is not called from within includes/language.php.
