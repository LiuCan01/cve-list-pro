** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in OpenConcept
Back-End CMS 0.4.7 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code via a URL in the includes_path parameter to (1) click.php or (2)
pollcollector.php in htdocs/; or (3) index.php, (4) articlepages.php,
(5) articles.php, (6) articleform.php, (7) articlesections.php, (8)
createArticlesPage.php, (9) guestbook.php, (10) helpguide.php, (11)
helpguideeditor.php, (12) links.php, (13) upload.php, (14)
sitestatistics.php, (15) nav.php, (16) tpl_upload.php, (17)
linksections, or (18) pophelp.php in htdocs/site-admin/; different
vectors than CVE-2006-5076.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by a third
party, who states that $includes_path is defined before use.
