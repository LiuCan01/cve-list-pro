** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in Simple Machines
Forum (SMF) 1.1.3 allows remote attackers to include local files via
unspecified vectors related to the sourcedir parameter or the
actionArray hash.  NOTE: CVE and multiple third parties dispute this
vulnerability because both sourcedir and actionArray are defined
before use.
