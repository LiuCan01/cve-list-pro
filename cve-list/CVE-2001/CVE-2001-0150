Internet Explorer 5.5 and earlier executes Telnet sessions using
command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands if the IE client
is using the Telnet client provided in Services for Unix (SFU) 2.0,
which creates session transcripts.
