 Christey> This item may have been re-introduced into the Apache source
   code sometime during 2002; CVE-2002-1233 has been created for
   that version, which affects Apache 1.3.27 and other versions.
 Christey> As a further clarification, CVE-2002-1233 is *only* for the
   Debian-specific regression error.
