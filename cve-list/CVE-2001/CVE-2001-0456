Reference: URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-032
Reference: XF:proftpd-postinst-root(6208)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/6208

postinst installation script for Proftpd in Debian 2.2 does not
properly change the "run as uid/gid root" configuration when the user
enables anonymous access, which causes the server to run at a higher
privilege than intended.
