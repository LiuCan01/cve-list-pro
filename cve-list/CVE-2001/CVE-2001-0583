   This is the site for downloading from Deerfield, the parent company.
   The release notes on the web site only apply to version 4.0 and higher.
   If you download the 3.5.6 version, you can then install the software,
   which will also install the release notes, named RelNotes.txt, in the
   docs sub-directory.  Inside this file is a vendor confirmation
   of sorts, at least close enough for me....
   I quote:
