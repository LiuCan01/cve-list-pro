Internet Explorer 5.5 and earlier does not properly verify the domain
of a frame within a browser window, which allows remote web site
operators to read certain files on the client by sending information
from a local frame to a frame in a different domain using
MSScriptControl.ScriptControl and GetObject, aka a variant of the
"Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability.

Voter Comments:
 Magdych> Duplicate of CVE-0246
 Christey> While it may look like CVE-2001-0332 is a duplicate of
   CVE-2001-0246, Microsoft specifically identifies two separate
   variants of the same problem in its advisory, namely 0332 and
   0246.  However, CD:SF-LOC currently suggests merging problems
   of the same type that appear and are fixed in the same
   software versions, and thus these 2 candidates *might*
   in fact be duplicates - relative to CD:SF-LOC.  Microsoft
   needs to be consulted on this.
 Williams> merge with CVE-0246
 Frech> XF:ie-frame-verification-read-files(6086)
   XF:ie-frame-verification-variant(6748)
   CVE-2001-0092 is also assigned to the
   ie-frame-verification-files(6086), but shouldn't be considered a
   duplicate.
