Multiple TCP implementations could allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (bandwidth and CPU exhaustion) by setting the
maximum segment size (MSS) to a very small number and requesting large
amounts of data, which generates more packets with less TCP-level data
that amplify network traffic and consume more server CPU to process.
