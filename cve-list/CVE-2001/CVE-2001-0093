 Frech> XF:kerberos4-arbitrary-proxy(9733)
   Description states FreeBSD, but advisory is for NetBSD.
 Prosser> http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/netbsd_advisory-1007.html
 CHANGE> [Prosser changed vote from ACCEPT to MODIFY]
 Prosser> The operating system in this CAN should also be NetBSD vice FreeBSD, same as in 0094.  FreeBSD 3.5 STABLE and 4.2 STABLE are vulnerable as well.  See ref
   FreeBSD-SA-01:25

   or http://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html#adv
 Christey> This description does not explicitly mention that the problem is
   in a kerberized telnet.  Need to verify that there aren't
   already other CVE's that describe this.
