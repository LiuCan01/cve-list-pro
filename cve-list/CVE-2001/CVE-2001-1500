Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/7126

ProFTPD 1.2.2rc2, and possibly other versions, does not properly
verify reverse-resolved hostnames by performing forward resolution,
which allows remote attackers to bypass ACLs or cause an incorrect
client hostname to be logged.
