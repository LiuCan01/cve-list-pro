** DISPUTED **
RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 allows local users to create a
spoofed named pipe when the service is stopped, then capture cleartext
usernames and passwords when clients connect to the service.  NOTE:
the vendor disputes this issue, saying that administrative privileges
are already required to exploit it.
