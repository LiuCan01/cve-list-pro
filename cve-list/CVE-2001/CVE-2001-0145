 Christey> In a post to Bugtraq, Joel Moses notes that this is a
   duplicate of CVE-2000-0756:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=98322714210100&w=2
   
   As of this writing, it is not certain which candidate
   should be preferred: the candidate that has been publicly
   known longer (i.e. CVE-2000-0756), or the more "official"
   candidate, which has probably been publicized more (i.e.
   CVE-2001-0145).
 Balinsky> It seems that this is a more specific case of
   CVE-2000-0756. The reference for 2000-0756 states that there is a
   buffer overflow in the birthday AND the e-mail field, as well as other
   suspected fields. As this current candidate only addresses the
   birthday field, it seems that there are likely different lines of code
   involved.
   Microsoft is not specific about what specifically the patch
   addresses. It is possible that the other overflows in 2000-0756 are
   still vulnerable and that the @stake group just didn't bother to test
   them.
   We will not know the answer until someone retests those other
   fields to see if they are still vulnerable.
   If they are, then 2000-0756 might deserve being split up.
