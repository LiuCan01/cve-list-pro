long host or domain name that is obtained from a reverse DNS lookup.

 Frech> XF:oops-dns-bo(6122)
 Christey> This looks like a different overflow than the one described
   in the original post at:
   http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2000-12/0127.html
   The vendor does acknowledge *that* problem in the 1.5.0
   comments of
   http://zipper.paco.net/~igor/oops/ChangeLog
 Christey> Vendor fixed this problem between 1.4.22 and 1.5.5, based
   on a source code comparison.
   CD:SF-LOC says that bugs of the same type, that appear in
   different versions, must be SPLIT.  Therefore this should
   stay separate from CVE-2001-0028.
   
   Change MISC to CONFIRM.  The comments for version 1.5.4
   say "more sprintf/strncpy fixes" and that's the type of
   changes that were made in lib.c, the code that was listed
   in the Bugtraq post for this CAN.
