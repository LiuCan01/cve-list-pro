Reference: ISS:20010806 Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in Raytheon SilentRunner
Reference: URL:http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise91.php

Buffer overflows in Raytheon SilentRunner allow remote attackers to
(1) cause a denial of service in the collector (cle.exe) component of
SilentRunner 2.0 via traffic containing long passwords, or (2) execute
arbitrary commands via long HTTP queries in the Knowledge Browser
component in SilentRunner 2.0 and 2.0.1.  NOTE: It is highly likely
that this candidate will be split into multiple candidates.
