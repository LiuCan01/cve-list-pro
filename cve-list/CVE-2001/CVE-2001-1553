Reference: VULN-DEV:20011202 Vulnerability in SETI@home
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/vuln-dev/2001-q4/0662.html

Buffer overflow in setiathome for SETI@home 3.03, if installed setuid,
could allow local users to execute arbitrary code via long command
line options (1) socks_server, (2) socks_user, and (3) socks_passwd.
NOTE: since the default configuration of setiathome is not setuid,
perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
