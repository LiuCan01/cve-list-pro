Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 through 6.0 could allow local users to
differentiate between alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters
used in a password by pressing certain control keys that jump between
non-alphanumeric characters, which makes it easier to conduct a
brute-force password guessing attack.
