SSH protocol 2 (aka SSH-2) public key authentication in the
development snapshot of OpenSSH 2.3.1, available from 2001-01-18
through 2001-02-08, does not perform a challenge-response step to
ensure that the client has the proper private key, which allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication as other users by supplying a
public key from that user's authorized_keys file.
