   The vendor says that "there is no denial of service
   vulnerability" but goes on to describe "a defect related to
   the use of SSL junctions between the WebSEAL component and Web
   Servers. This defect can cause the WebSEAL component to fail if SSL
   junctions are being used, and certain URLs are then passed across
   these junctions."  This still sounds like a DoS to me, albeit
   one that might not appear in all configurations.
   
   Fix capitalization: "WebSEAL"
