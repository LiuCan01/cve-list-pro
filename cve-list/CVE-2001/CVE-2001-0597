Zetetic Secure Tool for Recalling Important Passwords (STRIP) 0.5 and
earlier for the PalmOS allows a local attacker to recover passwords
via a brute force attack.  This attack is made feasible by STRIP's use
of SysRandom, which is seeded by TimeGetTicks, and an implementation
flaw which vastly reduces the password 'search space'.
