ColdFusion 4.5 and 5, when running on Windows with the advanced
security sandbox type set to "operating system," does not properly
pass security context to (1) child processes created with <CFEXECUTE>
and (2) child processes that call the CreateProcess function and are
executed with <CFOBJECT> or end with the CFX extension, which allows
attackers to execute programs with the permissions of the System
account.
