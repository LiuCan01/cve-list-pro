Bugzilla 2.10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
via shell metacharacters in a username that is then processed by (1)
the Bugzilla_login cookie in post_bug.cgi, or (2) the who parameter in
process_bug.cgi.

 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to RECAST]
 Christey> This needs to be MERGED with CVE-2000-0421.
   CVE-2000-0421 documents a problem in the "who" parameter of
   the process_bug.cgi program.  This is a duplicate of one of the
   problems being identified by CVE-2001-0329.  The other problem 
   in CVE-2001-0329, the Bugzilla_login cookie, is fixed in
   the same version as the who problem is.  CD:SF-EXEC
   suggests merging multiple executables in the same package
   that have the same problem that is present in the same version.
   Both the "who" and "Bugzilla_login" problems were fixed in
   version 2.12.  Therefore CVE-2000-0421 and CVE-2001-0329
   need to be MERGED.
