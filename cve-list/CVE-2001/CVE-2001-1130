Sdbsearch.cgi in SuSE Linux 6.0-7.2 could allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands by uploading a keylist.txt file that
contains filenames with shell metacharacters, then causing the file to
be searched using a .. in the HTTP referer (from the HTTP_REFERER
variable) to point to the directory that contains the keylist.txt
file.
