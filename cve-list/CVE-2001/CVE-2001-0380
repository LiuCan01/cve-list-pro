 Christey> Fix the date of the Bugtraq post
 Christey> The Bugtraq poster didn't provide many details, but said that
   the vendor was out of business.  It's possible that this ILMI
   community string has no relationship with the Cisco ILMI
   problem, in which case this should remain a separate CAN.
 Christey> Further research suggests that ILMI is a standard
   specification for ATM, and therefore this CAN should remain split from
   the Cisco ILMI problem (CVE-2001-0711).
