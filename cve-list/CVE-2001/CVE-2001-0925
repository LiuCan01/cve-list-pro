The default installation of Apache before 1.3.19 allows remote
attackers to list directories instead of the multiview index.html file
via an HTTP request for a path that contains many / (slash)
characters, which causes the path to be mishandled by (1)
mod_negotiation, (2) mod_dir, or (3) mod_autoindex.

 Frech> I'm using both candidates until we decide if it is a dupe,
   and then which 
   candidate to deprecate.

 Christey> CVE-2001-0925 and CVE-2001-0729 are different issues.
   CVE-2001-0925 only applies to versions before 1.3.19, whereas
   CVE-2001-0729 applies to 1.3.20, and only Windows.
   
   The Change Log at http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/CHANGES_1.3
   specifically mentions these CANs separately.
