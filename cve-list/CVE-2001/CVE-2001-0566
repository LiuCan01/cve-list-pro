Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Baker, Frech, Ziese
   MODIFY(1) Bishop
   NOOP(2) Cole, Wall
   REJECT(1) Foat

Voter Comments:
 Bishop> Is the entire switch shut down or is traffic blocked for a 
   limited time?
 Foat> Unable to duplicate event
 Baker> Seems kind of strange that someone that works at Cisco would accept this vulnerability,
   yet someone else would reject it.  I was unable to find a reference on the Cisco
   web site, so perhaps we need some clarification about the accept vote, like what build
   of the OS is vulnerable, since the "fail to duplicate" may be a different build of the
   OS.
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]
