IRC DCC helper in the ip_masq_irc IP masquerading module 2.2 allows
remote attackers to bypass intended firewall restrictions by causing
the target system to send a "DCC SEND" request to a malicious server
which listens on port 6667, which may cause the module to believe that
the traffic is a valid request and allow the connection to the port
specified in the DCC SEND request.
