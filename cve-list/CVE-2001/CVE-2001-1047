Race condition in OpenBSD VFS allows local users to cause a denial of
service (kernel panic) by (1) creating a pipe in one thread and
causing another thread to set one of the file descriptors to NULL via
a close, or (2) calling dup2 on a file descriptor in one process, then
setting the descriptor to NULL via a close in another process that is
created via rfork.
