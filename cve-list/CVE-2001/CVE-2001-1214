Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(1) Frech
   NOOP(6) Christey, Cole, Foat, Green, Wall, Ziese

Voter Comments:
 Christey> I can't find anything about "Marcus S. Xenakis" on the web at
   all, except for vulnerability reports.
 CHANGE> [Green changed vote from ACCEPT to NOOP]
 Green> The more I looked again today the more circular the references
   were getting.  And there's no single pointer to a Marcus
   Xenakis site.  So, I'll have to modify the vote to a NOOP.
 Christey> A similar issue is in CVE-2002-0434, but CVE-2002-0434 is for
   manual.php.
