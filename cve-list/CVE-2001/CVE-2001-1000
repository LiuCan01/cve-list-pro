Voter Comments:
 Frech> If the software is available to the general public, then it
   should
   be included in CVE. Marking the software 'MichNet Only' does not
   prevent
   someone from running it outside of MichNet, but it allegedly may
   protect
   MichNet against actual or perceived liabilities.
