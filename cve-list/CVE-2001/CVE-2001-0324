Windows 98 and Windows 2000 Java clients allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via a Java applet that opens a large number
of UDP sockets, which prevents the host from establishing any
additional UDP connections, and possibly causes a crash.

Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> Sun's Java specification does not provide for limits on the
   number of sockets that can be opened. We didn't write the spec, we just
   implemented it. Aside from the issue of EX-CLIENT-DOS issues noted in my
   comments on CVE-2001-0322, the vuln would need to be recast to show that
   the actual problem lies in Java. If the description is recast to show
   that the issue is in Sun's Java specification, then please change my
   vote to NOOP, as per the "don't vote on issues with other vendors" rule.
