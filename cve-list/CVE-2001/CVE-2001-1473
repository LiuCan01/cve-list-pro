The SSH-1 protocol allows remote servers to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks and replay a client challenge response to a target server by
creating a Session ID that matches the Session ID of the target, but
which uses a public key pair that is weaker than the target's public
key, which allows the attacker to compute the corresponding private
key and use the target's Session ID with the compromised key pair to
masquerade as the target.
