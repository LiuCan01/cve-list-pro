Trend Micro InterScan AppletTrap 2.0 does not properly filter URLs
when they are modified in certain ways such as (1) using a double
slash (//) instead of a single slash, (2) URL-encoded characters, (3)
requesting the IP address instead of the domain name, or (4) using
a leading 0 in an octet of an IP address.
