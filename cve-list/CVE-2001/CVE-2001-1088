Microsoft Outlook 8.5 and earlier, and Outlook Express 5 and earlier,
with the "Automatically put people I reply to in my address book"
option enabled, do not notify the user when the "Reply-To" address is
different than the "From" address, which could allow an untrusted
remote attacker to spoof legitimate addresses and intercept email from
the client that is intended for another user.
