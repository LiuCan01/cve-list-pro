Microsoft Windows 2000 telnet service creates named pipes with
predictable names and does not properly verify them, which allows
local users to execute arbitrary commands by creating a named pipe
with the predictable name and associating a malicious program with it,
the second of two variants of this vulnerability.

   Microsoft identifies two separate vulnerabilities that are extremely
   similar, but the security bulletin states that "The two
   vulnerabilities differ primarily in the way they exploit the
   underlying problem regarding named pipe creation."  So, it may be
   necessary to merge CVE-2001-0350 with CVE-2001-0349.
   
   If one issue is because of predictable names, and another
   issue is because pipe ownership isn't properly verified, then
   these could stay SPLIT, and the descriptions should be
   modified accordingly.
