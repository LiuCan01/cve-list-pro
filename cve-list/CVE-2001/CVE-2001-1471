prefs.php in phpBB 1.4.0 and earlier allows remote authenticated users
to execute arbitrary PHP code via an invalid language value, which
prevents the variables (1) $l_statsblock in prefs.php or (2)
$l_privnotify in auth.php from being properly initialized, which can
be modified by the user and later used in an eval statement.
