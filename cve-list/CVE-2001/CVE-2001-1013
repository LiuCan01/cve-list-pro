Apache on Red Hat Linux with with the UserDir directive enabled
generates different error codes when a username exists and there is no
public_html directory and when the username does not exist, which
could allow remote attackers to determine valid usernames on the
server.

Voter Comments:
 CHANGE> [Foat changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]
 Foat> This is only true if "indexes" are NOT enabled and the
   "public_html" directory exists for the user.
 Cox> The description says "Apache on Red Hat Linux".  This issue
   affects all versions of Apache that have UserDir enabled, not just
   Linux or RHL.  In Red Hat Linux we enable UserDir by default, but so
   do other distributions.
