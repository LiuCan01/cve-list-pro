SNMP service in Atmel 802.11b VNET-B Access Point 1.3 and earlier, as
used in Netgear ME102 and Linksys WAP11, accepts arbitrary community
strings with requested MIB modifications, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information such as WEP keys, cause a
denial of service, or gain access to the network.
