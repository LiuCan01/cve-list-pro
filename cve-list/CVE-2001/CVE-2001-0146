IIS 5.0 and Microsoft Exchange 2000 allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory allocation error) by repeatedly sending a
series of specially formatted URL's.

   Not only is this two applications, but it is fixed by two patches.
   Quoting Microsoft:
   Because the flaw occurs in two different code modules, one of which installs
   as part of IIS 5.0 and both of which install as part of Exchange 2000, it is
   important for Exchange 2000 administrators to install both the IIS and
   Exchange patches below. 
   Also, in the description, avoid using an apostrophe on "URLs" when it is
   simply plural and not possessive (aka the "grocer's apostrophe").
