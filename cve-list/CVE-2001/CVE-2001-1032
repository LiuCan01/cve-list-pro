admin.php in PHP-Nuke 5.2 and earlier, except 5.0RC1, does not check
login credentials for upload operations, which allows remote attackers
to copy and upload arbitrary files and read the PHP-Nuke configuration
file by directly calling admin.php with an upload parameter and
specifying the file to copy.
