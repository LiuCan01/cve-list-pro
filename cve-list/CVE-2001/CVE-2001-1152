Baltimore Technologies WEBsweeper 4.02, when used to manage URL
blacklists, allows remote attackers to bypass blacklist restrictions
and connect to unauthorized web servers by modifying the requested
URL, including (1) a // (double slash), (2) a /SUBDIR/.. where the
desired file is in the parentdir, (3) a /./, or (4) URL-encoded
characters.

Voter Comments:
 Ziese> ACCEPT REASON: Rejection logic makes sense, products have to be used as
   intended.  Misuse is not a security vulnerability per se.
 Frech> XF:content-slash-bypass-filter(6816)
 Baker> I would say that this is a vulnerability, since their website
   touts URL filtering as a feature of the product.  If the product has to
   filter URL's then the product needs to be able to filter URL's properly,
   or the product fails.
   Here is the list of features, quoted from their product page for
   web sweeper:
   
   "Key Features
   Policy based web security implementation for information posted to and downloaded from the web
   Protects against unauthorized users accessing the web utilizing user authentication
   Provides URL filtering blocking stopping inappropriate site access
   Protects against loss of confidential information, viruses, portable code, and inappropriate content entering and
   leaving via web based e-mail accounts such as hotmail and Yahoo
   Auditing and reporting on individual and group web traffic
   Customizable "Block" and "Progress Message" pages "
