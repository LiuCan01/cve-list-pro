 Frech> Change to reliant-unix-icmp-dos(6646)
 Christey> (prompted from Pascal Meunier) should this be treated
   as a general design issue with ICMP?  Or is it a specific
   implementation flaw that only affects Reliant?
 Meunier> lower level (more precise) duplicate or sub-class of high
   level description CVE-1999-0214
