POP3Lite before 0.2.4 does not properly quote a . (dot) in an email
message, which could allow a remote attacker to append arbitrary text
to the end of an email message, which could then be interpreted by
various mail clients as valid POP server responses or other input that
could cause clients to crash or otherwise behave unexpectedly.
