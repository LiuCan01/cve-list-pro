SonicWALL Tele2 and SOHO firewalls with 6.0.0.0 firmware using IPSEC
with IKE pre-shared keys do not allow for the use of full 128 byte IKE
pre-shared keys, which is the intended design of the IKE pre-shared
key, and only support 48 byte keys.  This allows a remote attacker to
brute force attack the pre-shared keys with significantly less
resources than if the full 128 byte IKE pre-shared keys were used.
