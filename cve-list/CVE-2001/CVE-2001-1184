wrshdsp.exe in Denicomp Winsock RSHD/NT 2.21.00 and earlier allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via
(1) in 2.20.00 and earlier, an invalid port number such as a negative
number, which causes a connection attempt to that port and all ports
below 1024, and (2) in 2.21.00, a port number of 1024.
