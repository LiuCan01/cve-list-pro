Voter Comments:
 Christey> There is some overlap between CVE-2001-0551 and CVE-2001-0772.
   CVE-2001-0551 describes a specific vulnerability in
   dtprintinfo.  HP acknowledges CVE-2001-0551 by stating
   that the problem is fixed in HP:HPSBUX0105-151, which
   is CVE-2001-0772.  But CVE-2001-0772 is a vague advisory
   that identifies other vulnerabilities (and vulnerability
   types) besides CVE-2001-0551.  Perhaps CVE-2001-0772 should
   be RECAST to "remove" the reference to dtprintinfo and
   leave the other vague descriptions.  CVE-2001-0772 and
   CVE-2001-0551 are very good examples of the problems that
   CVE faces in being consistent with respect to the level of
   abstraction, as documented in the CD:SF-CODEBASE, CD:SF-LOC,
   and CD:VAGUE content decisions.
