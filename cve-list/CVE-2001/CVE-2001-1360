Voter Comments:
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]
 Cox> I'm not sure how to vote on this, I did the research and read
   the changlog and it appears that the issue you mention here has not
   been fixed at all; merely documented as of sane version 1.0.5
   
   Change description based on the information in the Sane tarball; note that 
   this affects all versions to date and is not fixed.

   - Security problems with pnm
   If the pnm backend is installed and saned is used to allow users on
   remote computers to scan on the local machine, pnm files can be read by
   the remote user. This is limited to the files saned can access (usually
   it's running as user "sane"). All pnm files can be read if saned runs
   as root which isn't recommended anyway. The pnm backend is disabled
   by default. If you want to use it, enable it with configure (see 
   configure --help for details). Be sure that only trusted users can
   access the pnm backend over saned.
