FTP server in Solaris 8 and earlier allows local and remote attackers
to cause a core dump in the root directory, possibly with
world-readable permissions, by providing a valid username with an
invalid password followed by a CWD ~ command, which could release
sensitive information such as shadowed passwords, or fill the disk
partition.

   The "world-readable" core dump problem does not exist in
   Solaris 8 and other Solaris releases which have been patched
   to include the "coreadm" command and possibly earlier (many release
   have been patched to avoid core dumps in more situations and
   always make them mode 0600)
   
   Solaris 8 was the first release to contain coreadm initially
   (backported and include in 2.6 & 7)
   Solaris 7 was the first release to make core dumps mode 0600.
   (fix backported to 2.6 and earlier)
