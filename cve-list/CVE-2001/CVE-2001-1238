Task Manager in Windows 2000 does not allow local users to end
processes with uppercase letters named (1) winlogon.exe, (2)
csrss.exe, (3) smss.exe and (4) services.exe via the Process tab which
could allow local users to install Trojan horses that cannot be
stopped with the Task Manager.

Voter Comments:
 Baker> I don't think this is really a vulnerability.  If I am not mistaken,
   those are "services" which have to be managed by the services control
   in windows 2K.  This keeps users from killing things the system has
   to have.  I don't think it is possible to kill another of other services
   in this manner either.  Try it on almost any W2K system, and there are any
   number of services that you cannot kill from the process tab, rather you
   must go to the services controller to stop the service.
   I vote to reject this, as this is not a vulnerability, since you would have
   to be administrator on the system to change one of these services to a trojan
   version anyway.
