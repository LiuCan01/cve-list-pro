RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 only creates one session instance at
a time, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (RunAs
hang) by creating a named pipe session with the authentication server
without any request for service.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this
vulnerability, however the vendor also presents a scenario in which
other users could be affected if running on a Terminal Server.
Therefore this is a vulnerability.
