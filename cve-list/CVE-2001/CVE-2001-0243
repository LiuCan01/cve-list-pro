Windows Media Player 7 and earlier stores Internet shortcuts in a
user's Temporary Files folder with a fixed filename instead of in the
Internet Explorer cache, which causes the HTML in those shortcuts to
run in the Local Computer Zone instead of the Internet Zone, which
allows remote attackers to read certain files.
