Voter Comments:
 Christey> INCLUSION: The author of the zml.cgi program says that the vulnerable
   version is not his, and that zml.cgi does not take a file parameter.
   If this is an adaptation of that zml.cgi program, and the adaptation
   is not generally available, then it should not be included in CVE.
   Almost all of the hits on Google for "zml.cgi" are references to the
   reported vulnerability, and a search for "zml" doesn't turn up any
   obvious web pages, so it cannot be determined if there is another
   product that happens to use a script named zml.cgi.
