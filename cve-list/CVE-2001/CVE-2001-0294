   The CWD... may have been rediscovered for version 0.95 in:
   BUGTRAQ:20010507 Vulnerabilty in TYPsoft FTP server

   However, this CWD uses ".../" whereas the initial post
   used just "..." and said that the vendor had fixed the issue.
   So, this is probably just an incomplete fix by the vendor.
