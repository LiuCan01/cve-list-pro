The rendering engine in Internet Explorer determines the MIME type
independently of the type that is specified by the server, which
allows remote servers to automatically execute script which is placed
in a file whose MIME type does not normally support scripting, such as
text (.txt), JPEG (.jpg), etc.

Voter Comments:
 Baker> I would argue that a browser executing a script when it shouldn't is still a vulnerability.  If it is supposed to be a non-scriptable file type, and that fails, resulting in a script being executed without the user's knowledge, then it is a problem, and thus should be included as a vulnerability.  I vote this should be accepted, and if Microsoft acknowledges this in their follow up, then you have vendor acknowledgement of the problem as well.
 Foat> The candidate does not meet the criteria for a vulnerability or 
   exposure, even though it describes an unexpected behavior.
