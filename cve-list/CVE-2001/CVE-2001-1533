** DISPUTED *
Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a flood of
fragmented UDP packets.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying
that it requires high bandwidth to exploit, and the server does not
experience any instability.  Therefore this "laws of physics" issue
might not be included in CVE.
