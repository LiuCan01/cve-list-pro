Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/6775.php

load_prefs.php and supporting include files in SquirrelMail 1.0.4 and
earlier do not properly initialize certain PHP variables, which allows
remote attackers to (1) view sensitive files via the config_php and
data_dir options, and (2) execute arbitrary code by using
options_order.php to upload a message that could be interpreted as
PHP.
