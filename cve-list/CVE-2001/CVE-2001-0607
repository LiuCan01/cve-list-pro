asecure as included with HP-UX 10.01 through 11.00 can allow a local
attacker to create a denial of service and gain additional privileges
via unsafe permissions on the asecure program, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2000-0083.

 Frech> XF:hp-asecure-dos(6212)
   Possible duplicate of CVE-2000-0083: HP asecure creates the
   Audio Security File audio.sec with insecure permissions, which allows
   local users to cause a denial of service or gain additional
   privileges.
 Williams> Frech - this is not a dupe of CVE-2000-0083.
 Christey> While this advisory is vaguely worded, the fact that HP did an
   advisory for the other asecure problem (now CVE-2000-0083)
   indicates at the very least that this problem occurs in
   a different version than CVE-2000-0083, so CD:SF-LOC
   suggests a SPLIT.  However, the HP advisory says "10.X"
   and "11.X" are affected, so who knows what versions they
   *really* mean?
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
