eEye SecureIIS versions 1.0.3 and earlier allows a remote attacker to
bypass filtering of requests made to SecureIIS by escaping HTML
characters within the request, which could allow a remote attacker to
use restricted variables and perform directory traversal attacks on
vulnerable programs that would otherwise be protected.
