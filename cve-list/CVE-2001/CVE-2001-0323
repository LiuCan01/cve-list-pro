The ICMP path MTU (PMTU) discovery feature in various UNIX systems
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by spoofing "ICMP
Fragmentation needed but Don't Fragment (DF) set" packets between two
target hosts, which could cause one host to lower its MTU when
transmitting to the other host.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> (prompted from Pascal Meunier) should this be treated
   as a general design issue with ICMP?  Or is it a specific
   implementation flaw that only affects Reliant?
 Meunier> It seems obvious that if one sets the MTU to just one byte
   above the size of a IP header (let's say 21 bytes), data transmission
   is not going to go anywhere fast, as the overhead will be 20 times the
   payload...  As I said for another candidate, ICMP messages should not
   be acted upon without access control.  I'm not sure that references to
   UNIX should be kept.  It seems that this should work with any OS.  It
   would be nasty if some OSes accepted an MTU of 20, as you could not
   transmit any IP data.
