The glob functionality in ProFTPD 1.2.1, and possibly other versions
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory
consumption) via commands with large numbers of wildcard and other
special characters, as demonstrated using an ls command with multiple
(1) "*/..", (2) "*/.*", or (3) ".*./*?/" sequences in the argument.
