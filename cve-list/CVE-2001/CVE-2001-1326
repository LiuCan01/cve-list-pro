Eudora 5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code when the
"Use Microsoft Viewer" option is enabled and the "allow executables in
HTML content" option is disabled, via an HTML email with a form that
is activated from an image that the attacker spoofs as a link, which
causes the user to execute the form and access embedded attachments.
