Voter Comments:
 Christey> According to an email message from the vendor
   (bcoveney@4d.com) on March 13, 2002, this problem is only
   possible if the server admin has already configured the
   server's web root to be at the top-level folder.  This is not
   the default.  As such, any "directory traversal" attack would
   not escape above the folder that has already been specified by
   the admin.  Since this is a generic misconfiguration problem
   for all web servers, and not a default configuration of ACI
   4D, then this candidate should not be included in CVE.
   
   The quote from the vendor is: "By default the 4D WebServer
   doesn't have this behavior. A property has to be turned on to allow
   this (despite our warnings of the consequences). We don't allow pages
   outside of our web folder to be served but if the developer of the
   site wishes they can set the webroot folder to be whatever they
   want. In the system that 'krfinisterre@checkfree.com' evaluated the
   developer had chosen to set their root folder to be the root of the
   computer system (C:) and therefore all the files on the system were
   available. By default we set the root folder at the same level as the
   database folder so this doesn't happen. You cannot look at any files
   outside the designated WebFolder root tree."
