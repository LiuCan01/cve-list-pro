ValiCert Enterprise Validation Authority (EVA) Administration Server
3.3 through 4.2.1 uses insufficiently random data to (1) generate
session tokens for HSMs using the C rand function, or (2) generate
certificates or keys using /dev/urandom instead of another source
which blocks when the entropy pool is low, which could make it easier
for local or remote attackers to steal tokens or certificates via
brute force guessing.
