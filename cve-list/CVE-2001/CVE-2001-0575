   "What is SSE072B, the buffer overflow security patch for Openserver 5? (Ref. #113723)"
   Buffer overflows have been found in the following 19
   SCO OpenServer 5 utilities:
   
   /usr/bin/accept
   /usr/bin/cancel
   /usr/mmdf/bin/deliver
   /usr/bin/disable
   /usr/bin/enable
   /usr/lib/libcurses.a
   /usr/bin/lp
   /usr/lib/lpadmin
   /usr/lib/lpfilter
   /usr/lib/lpforms
   /usr/lib/lpmove
   /usr/lib/lpshut
   /usr/bin/lpstat
   /usr/lib/lpusers
   /usr/bin/recon
   /usr/bin/reject
   /usr/bin/rmail
   /usr/lib/sendmail
   /usr/bin/tput
   
   NOTE: the accept, reject, enable, and disable commands are
   symbolically linked to the same binary.
   
   Running any of the above utilities with a very large argument
   can result in a core dump.
