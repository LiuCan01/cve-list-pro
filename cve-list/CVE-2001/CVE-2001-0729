Voter Comments:
 Christey> The initial description originally stated that this was a
   denial of service, but it's really a directory listing
   problem.  I changed the description accordingly.
 Frech> XF:apache-slash-directory-listing(6921)

 Christey> CVE-2001-0925 and CVE-2001-0729 are different issues.
   CVE-2001-0925 only applies to versions before 1.3.19, whereas
   CVE-2001-0729 applies to 1.3.20, and only Windows.
   
   The Change Log at http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/CHANGES_1.3
   specifically mentions these CANs separately.
