Voter Comments:
 Christey> CALDERA:CSSA-2001-006.0 specifically says they're not
   vulnerable to this issue.  So, do we remove the reference
   (because they aren't affected by this problem), or do we
   keep the reference because it specifically mentions this
   issue?
   
   Need to review the other advisories; they don't necessarily
   have the details to know whether they're addressing this
   problem or not (the overflow mentioned in these refs is
   covered by CVE-2001-1274).  MANDRAKE:MDKSA-2001:014
   clearly identifies this issue.
   
   FREEBSD:FreeBSD-SA-01:16 discussed "remote vulerabilities"
   (plural), which *could* include this issue, but it is not
   absolutely certain.  REDHAT:RHSA-2001:003 refers to
   "information protection issues," but that's not clear enough
   either.
   
   Thanks to John Segura of secureinfo.com for noticing this
   issue.
