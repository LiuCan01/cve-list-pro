Voter Comments:
 Frech> DUPLICATE OF CVE-2001-0036: KTH Kerberos IV allows local users to
   overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a ticket file. 
 Oliver> Appears to be a subset of CVE-2001-036.
 Christey> Change description to point out that the Kerberos 5 package is
   affected.
   FREEBSD:FreeBSD-SA-01:25
   Also ensure that the other problems described in the FreeBSD
   advisory have CANs/CVEs.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REJECT]
 Christey> Agree that these are dupes.  Since CVE-2001-0036 is already
   an official CVE entry, this candidate will be rejected.
   This CAN's references will be added to CVE-2001-0036.
