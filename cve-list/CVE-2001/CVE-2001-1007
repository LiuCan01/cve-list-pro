Reference: BUGTRAQ:20010824 Starfish Truesync Desktop + REX 5000 Pro multiple vulnerabilities
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/210067

Starfish Truesync Desktop 2.0b as used on the REX 5000 PDA uses a
small keyspace for device keys and does not impose a delay when an
incorrect key is entered, which allows attackers to more quickly guess
the key via a brute force attack.
