Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Foat, Frech, Green
   NOOP(2) Baker, Cole
   REJECT(2) Armstrong, Ziese
   REVIEWING(1) Wall

Voter Comments:
 Ziese> fact that important system
   files are not appropriately secured from user, a/o admin, level access.
 Green> ACCESS TO THE WINNT/SYSTEM32 DIRECTORY, ALLOWING FOR A DoS TO BE PERFORMED.
 Foat> Our attempts to repair the computer with the Windows NT cd-rom failed. 
   The machine still would not allow logins. Tried two different NT 4.0 CD's. Both 
   CD's gave the error message that the file MSV1_0.dll read okay but is invalid on 
   the hard drive. It says the CD is probably defective.
 Armstrong> I don't believe that a privileged user being able to run code
   on a system is a vulnerability.
 Baker> I generally agree that unless you are elevating your priveleges, this should not be listed as a vulnerability.
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
