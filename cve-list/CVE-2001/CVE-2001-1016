PGP Corporate Desktop before 7.1, Personal Security before 7.0.3,
Freeware before 7.0.3, and E-Business Server before 7.1 does not
properly display when invalid userID's are used to sign a message,
which could allow an attacker to make the user believe that the
document has been signed by a trusted third party by adding a second,
invalid user ID to a key which has already been signed by the third
party, aka the "PGPsdk Key Validity Vulnerability."
