 Christey> Should CVE-2002-0099 and/or CVE-2001-0433 be MERGED with
   CVE-2000-0641?  All describe slightly different overflows
   that, perhaps, should be merged according to CD:SF-LOC.
   It depends on which versions are affected, which would require
   some vendor acknowledgement or consultation.
   
   A vague changelog for version 3.1 at
   http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=75333 says
   "security fixes" but it's not clear *which* security fixes
   were made.
   
   The description for CVE-2000-0641 is slightly incorrect.  The
   exploit is clearly due to a large number of headers, not
   arguments to the GET request itself.  So, CVE-2000-0641
   clearly overlaps with CVE-2001-0433.
   
   The exploit for CVE-2001-0433 also doesn't really have
   anything to do with a "cgi-test.pl" program (which isn't in
   the distribution).  The discloser simply used that as an
   example program of a long request.
