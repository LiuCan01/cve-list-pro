The Log Viewer function in the Check Point FireWall-1 GUI for Solaris
3.0b through 4.1 SP2 does not check for the existence of '.log' files
when saving files, which allows (1) remote authenticated users to
overwrite arbitrary files ending in '.log', or (2) local users to
overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
