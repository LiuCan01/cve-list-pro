Reference: BUGTRAQ:20010902 S/Key keyinit(1) authentication (lack thereof) + sudo(1)
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-08/0441.html

keyinit in S/Key does not require authentication to initialize a
one-time password sequence, which allows an attacker who has gained
privileges to a user account to create new one-time passwords for use
in other activities that may use S/Key authentication, such as sudo.
