** DISPUTED **
RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 stores cleartext authentication
information in memory, which could allow attackers to obtain usernames
and passwords by executing a process that is allocated the same memory
page after termination of a RunAs command.  NOTE: the vendor disputes
this issue, saying that administrative privileges are already required
to exploit it, and the original researcher did not respond to requests
for additional information.
