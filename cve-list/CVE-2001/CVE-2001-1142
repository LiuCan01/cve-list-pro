privileges.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> In an e-mail response, the vendor stated that they were
   not a crypto expert and were using their own home-grown
   crypto.
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]
 Baker> I received an email from Artchil Gogava, of Argosoft, author
   of the program in question.  I think this is sufficient verification
   that the problem is probably as identified.  He states he is not an
   encryption expert, and that he invented his own encryption mechanism
   for this.  Need I say more?

   Hello David,
   
   lnk problem, described in the document, has been fixed ages ago, and it does
   not present in 1.2.2.2.  As of password encryption.  I am not an encryption
   expert.  I am using a method invented by myself, and I am sure that whatever
   I do, someone, who has spare time to play around with it, will find the
   method to decrypt it.
   
   Archie
