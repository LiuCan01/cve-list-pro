   Statement of fix is ambiguous: A major security flaw in the scripts
   has now been fixed. For obvious reasons the details of the flaw will
   not be posted here. 
   Site lists their product as A1-Stats, not A1Stats as in description.
 CHANGE> [Bishop changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
 Christey> The URL recommended by Andre is *probably* addressing this
   problem, but it's not quite certain.  There is insufficient
   detail to determine if the vendor has truly acknowledged the
   problem.  I have an email to a1stats@gadnet.com to see
   if I can confirm.
   
   This is affected by CD:SF-EXEC since multiple executables in the same
   package are affected (a1disp.cgi, a1disp2.cgi, a1disp4.cgi, and
   a1disp3.cgi).
 Christey> Received confirmation via email, 2/26/2002.
