Orinoco RG-1000 wireless Residential Gateway uses the last 5 digits of
the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) encryption key.  Since the SSID occurs in the clear during
communications, a remote attacker could determine the WEP key and
decrypt RG-1000 traffic.

Voter Comments:
 Ziese> vulnerability, per se, then why is this?  If WEP is delievred enabled, by
   any vendor, it must give the existing/default WEP-key somewhere.  Will every
   hardware product be flawed by his definition?
