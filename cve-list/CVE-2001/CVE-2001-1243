Scripting.FileSystemObject in asp.dll for Microsoft IIS 4.0 and 5.0
allows local or remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
via (1) creating an ASP program that uses Scripting.FileSystemObject
to open a file with an MS-DOS device name, or (2) remotely injecting
the device name into ASP programs that internally use
Scripting.FileSystemObject.
