Password Safe 1.7(1) leaves cleartext passwords in memory when a user
copies the password to the clipboard and minimizes Password Safe with
the "Clear the password when minimized" and "Lock password database on
minimize and prompt on restore" options enabled, which could allow an
attacker with access to the memory (e.g. an administrator) to read the
passwords.
