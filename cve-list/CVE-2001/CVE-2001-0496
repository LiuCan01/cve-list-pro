Voter Comments:
 Williams> kdesu is part of kdelibs package.  since entire kdelibs package must be upgraded, and since kdelibs (rather than kdesu) is referenced in most advisories related to this issue, we might want to reference kdelibs in this CAN.
 Frech> XF:kdelibs-kdesu-insecure-tmpfile(6856)
 Christey> Agree with Ken Williams.  The CVE descriptions in general
   should capture all "reasonable" keywords under which
   someone may know the vulnerability.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> It's possible that this is the same vulnerability as CVE-2001-0178,
   but the description is written so differently from the others, that
   it's hard to be sure.  In addition, Mandrake released a separate
   advisory for CVE-2001-0178.
   BID:2669 addresses CVE-2001-0178.
