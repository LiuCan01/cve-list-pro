 Frech> CONFIRM:http://www.notes.net/qmrdown.nsf/QMRWelcome; Lotus
   does not seem to wax prolific with their DoS explanations. For 5.0.7,
   any of these SPR#s have the explanation "Fixed a potential Denial of
   Service attack on HTTP.": JCHN4TQS2T, JCHN4RPKC2, JCHN4TQNL8,
   JCHN4JQKYQ, JCHN4TGN32.
