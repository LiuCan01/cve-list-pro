Voter Comments:
 Christey> HP:HPSBUX0106-152 might address CVE-2001-0746 or
   CVE-2001-0747, or maybe neither, but only HP knows for sure.
   See: http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/hp/2001-q2/0059.html
 Christey> I am about to create a separate candidate for the HP advisory.
   Obviously that advisory is affected by CD:VAGUE.
