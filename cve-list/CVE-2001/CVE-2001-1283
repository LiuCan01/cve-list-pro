The webmail interface for Ipswitch IMail 7.04 and earlier allows
remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
mailbox name that contains a large number of . (dot) or other
characters to programs such as (1) readmail.cgi or (2) printmail.cgi,
possibly due to a buffer overflow that may allow execution of
arbitrary code.
