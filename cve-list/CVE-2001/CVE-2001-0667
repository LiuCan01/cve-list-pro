Internet Explorer 6 and earlier, when used with the Telnet client in
Services for Unix (SFU) 2.0, allows remote attackers to execute
commands by spawning Telnet with a log file option on the command line
and writing arbitrary code into an executable file which is later
executed, aka a new variant of the Telnet Invocation vulnerability as
described in CVE-2001-0150.
