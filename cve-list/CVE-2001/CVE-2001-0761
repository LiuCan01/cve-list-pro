   Note, however, that the date of the patch description at
   MISC:http://solutionfile.trendmicro.com/SolutionFile/9682/en/ReadMe-BufferOverflowPatch.txt
   is June 19th, but the Bugtraq post was July 2, and the poster
   said that a patch had not been available yet.  However, the
   poster also said that they had notified Trend on June 11.
   Add that the Action parameter is the one with the overflow.
   
   This patch description only identifies HttpSave.dll, not
   RegGo.dll (as identified by CVE-2001-0678), but it implies
   that multiple DLL's may have been fixed.  Looking at the DLL's
   in the patch, there is RegGo.dll and a number of other DLL's.
   However, this RegGo.dll is different than the one from
   the patch for CVE-2001-0678, so maybe they fixed yet another
   problem here.
   
   That problem might be:
   BUGTRAQ:20010621 TrendMicro InterScan WebManager Version 1.2 RegGo.dll Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/192645
   where the discloser said that the problem was discovered
   in June 6 and implied that Trend Micro would fix the problem,
   so Trend was notified sometime between June 6 and June 21.
   So, the dates might imply that Trend fixed both the
   HTTPSave.dll and this variant (if in fact it's a variant and
   not a rediscovery of CVE-2001-0678) in a single patch.
   If true, then that would argue that this candidate should be 
   merged with the RegGo.dll variant reported in the above
   Bugtraq reference, along with some of the other DLL's - just
   in case someone rediscovers THOSE, too.
   
   Other DLL's in this patch are covered in other posts
   in the same time frame by the same person.
   HttpSaveCVP.dll and HttpSaveCSP.dll are in:
