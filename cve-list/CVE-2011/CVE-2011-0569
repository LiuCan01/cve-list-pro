The Font Xtra.x32 module in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.9.620
allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) via a PFR1 chunk containing an invalid
size value that leads to an unexpected sign extension and a buffer
overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0556.
