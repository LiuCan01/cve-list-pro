Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 does not properly validate
string data that is intended for storage in an XML document, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (parsing error)
or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted cookie, as
demonstrated by cookies to client@1/domain@1/hosting/file-manager/ and
certain other files.
