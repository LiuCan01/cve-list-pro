WINS in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 and Server 2008 Gold, SP2,
R2, and R2 SP1 does not properly handle socket send exceptions, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) via crafted packets, related to unintended
stack-frame values and buffer passing, aka "WINS Service Failed
Response Vulnerability."
