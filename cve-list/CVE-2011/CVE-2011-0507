FTPService.exe in Blackmoon FTP 3.1 Build 1735 and Build 1736
(3.1.7.1736), and possibly other versions before 3.1.8.1737, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large
number of PORT commands with long arguments, which triggers a NULL
pointer dereference.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
