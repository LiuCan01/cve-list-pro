SugarCRM before 6.1.3 does not properly handle reloads and direct
requests for a warning page produced by a certain duplicate check,
which allows remote authenticated users to discover (1) the names of
customers via a ShowDuplicates action to the Accounts module,
reachable through index.php; or (2) the names of contact persons via a
ShowDuplicates action to the Contacts module, reachable through
index.php.
