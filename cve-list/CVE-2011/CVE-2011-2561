Reference: CISCO:20110824 Cisco Unified Communications Manager Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
Reference: URL:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a0080b8f531.shtml

The SIP process in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (aka CUCM,
formerly CallManager) 7.x before 7.1(5b)su4 and 8.x before 8.0(1) does
not properly handle SDP data within a SIP call in certain situations
related to use of the g729ar8 codec for a Media Termination Point
(MTP), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(service outage) via a crafted call, aka Bug ID CSCtc61990.
