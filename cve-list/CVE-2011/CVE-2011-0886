Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the web
interface on the SMC SMCD3G-CCR (aka Comcast Business Gateway) with
firmware before 1.4.0.49.2 allow remote attackers to (1) hijack the
intranet connectivity of arbitrary users for requests that perform a
login via goform/login, or hijack the authentication of administrators
for requests that (2) enable external logins via an mso_remote_enable
action to goform/RemoteRange or (3) change DNS settings via a
manual_dns_enable action to goform/Basic.
