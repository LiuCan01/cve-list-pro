Reference: XF:widelands-filesystem-file-overwrite(71626)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/71626

The pathname canonicalization functionality in
io/filesystem/filesystem.cc in Widelands before 15.1 expands leading ~
(tilde) characters to home-directory pathnames but does not restrict
use of these characters in strings received from the network, which
might allow remote attackers to conduct absolute path traversal
attacks and overwrite arbitrary files via a ~ in a pathname that is
used for a file transfer in an Internet game, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-1932.
