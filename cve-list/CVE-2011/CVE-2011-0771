The Janrain Engage (formerly RPX) module 6.x-1.3 for Drupal does not
validate the file for a profile image, which allows remote
authenticated users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and
possibly execute arbitrary PHP code by causing a crafted avatar to be
downloaded from an external login provider site.
