The to_s method in
actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb in Ruby on
Rails 3.0.5 does not validate the X-Forwarded-For header in requests
from IP addresses on a Class C network, which might allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files or bypass intended
address parsing via a crafted header.
