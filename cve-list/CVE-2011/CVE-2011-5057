Apache Struts 2.3.1.1 and earlier provides interfaces that do not
properly restrict access to collections such as the session and
request collections, which might allow remote attackers to modify
run-time data values via a crafted parameter to an application that
implements an affected interface, as demonstrated by the SessionAware,
RequestAware, ApplicationAware, ServletRequestAware,
ServletResponseAware, and ParameterAware interfaces.  NOTE: the vendor
disputes the significance of this report because of an "easy
work-around in existing apps by configuring the interceptor."
