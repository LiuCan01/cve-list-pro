ld.so in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.13 and earlier
expands the $ORIGIN dynamic string token when RPATH is composed
entirely of this token, which might allow local users to gain
privileges by creating a hard link in an arbitrary directory to a (1)
setuid or (2) setgid program with this RPATH value, and then executing
the program with a crafted value for the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-3847 and
CVE-2011-0536.  NOTE: it is not expected that any standard
operating-system distribution would ship an applicable setuid or
setgid program.
