The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20
generates a password form field without disabling the autocomplete
feature, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
authentication by leveraging an unattended workstation, as
demonstrated by forms in smb/my-profile and certain other files.
