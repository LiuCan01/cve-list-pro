The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20
does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for a
cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie, as
demonstrated by cookies used by get_password.php and certain other
files.
