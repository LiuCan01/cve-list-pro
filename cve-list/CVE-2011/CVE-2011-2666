The default configuration of the SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open
Source 1.4.x through 1.4.41.2 and 1.6.2.x through 1.6.2.18.2 does not
enable the alwaysauthreject option, which allows remote attackers to
enumerate account names by making a series of invalid SIP requests and
observing the differences in the responses for different usernames, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2536.
