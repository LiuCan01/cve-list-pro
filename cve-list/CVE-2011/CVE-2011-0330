The Dell DellSystemLite.Scanner ActiveX control in DellSystemLite.ocx
1.0.0.0 does not properly restrict the values of the
WMIAttributesOfInterest property, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary WMI Query Language (WQL) statements via a crafted
value, as demonstrated by a value that triggers disclosure of
information about installed software.
