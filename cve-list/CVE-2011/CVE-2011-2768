Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a client or bridge, sends a
TLS certificate chain as part of an outgoing OR connection, which
allows remote relays to bypass intended anonymity properties by
reading this chain and then determining the set of entry guards that
the client or bridge had selected.
