The installer in PEAR 1.9.2 and earlier allows local users to
overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the package.xml
file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir, (3) tmp_dir, and
(4) pear-build-download directories.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1072.
