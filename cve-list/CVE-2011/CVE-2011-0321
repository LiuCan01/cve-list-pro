librpc.dll in nsrexecd in EMC NetWorker before 7.5 SP4, 7.5.3.x before
7.5.3.5, and 7.6.x before 7.6.1.2 does not properly mitigate the
possibility of a spoofed localhost source IP address, which allows
remote attackers to (1) register or (2) unregister RPC services, and
consequently cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information
from interprocess communication, via crafted UDP packets containing
service commands.
