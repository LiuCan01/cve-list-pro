The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel
10.2.0_build1011110331.18 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a
Set-Cookie header for a cookie, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script
access to this cookie, as demonstrated by cookies used by
login_up.php3 and certain other files.
