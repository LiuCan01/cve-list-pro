The GPU support functionality in Windows XP does not properly restrict
rendering time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (system crash) via vectors involving WebGL and (1) shader
programs or (2) complex 3D geometry, as demonstrated by using Mozilla
Firefox or Google Chrome to visit the lots-of-polys-example.html test
page in the Khronos WebGL SDK.
