Tivoli Endpoint in IBM Tivoli Management Framework 3.7.1, 4.1, 4.1.1,
and 4.3.1 has an unspecified "built-in account" that is "trivially"
accessed, which makes it easier for remote attackers to send requests
to restricted pages via a session on TCP port 9495, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-1220.
