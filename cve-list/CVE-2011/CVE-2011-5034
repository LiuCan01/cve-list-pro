Apache Geronimo 2.2.1 and earlier computes hash values for form
parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions
predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.  NOTE:
this might overlap CVE-2011-4461.
