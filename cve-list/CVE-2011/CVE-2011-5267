Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
spell-check-savedicts.php in the SpellChecker module in Xinha, as used
in WikiWig 5.01 and possibly other products, allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) to_p_dict or (2)
to_r_list parameter.  NOTE: this issue might be related to the htmlarea
plugin and CVE-2013-5670.
