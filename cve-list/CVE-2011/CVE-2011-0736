** DISPUTED ** Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 CHF1 and earlier, when a web
application is configured to use a DBMS, allows remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information about the database structure
via an id=- query to a .cfm file.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the
significance of this issue because the Site-wide Error Handler and
Debug Output Settings sections of the ColdFusion Lockdown guide
explain the requirement for settings that prevent this information
disclosure.
