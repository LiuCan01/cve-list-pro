Reference: CISCO:20110928 Jabber Extensible Communications Platform and Cisco Unified Presence XML Denial of Service Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a0080b95d47.shtml

Cisco Jabber Extensible Communications Platform (aka Jabber XCP) 2.x
through 5.4.x before 5.4.0.27581 and 5.8.x before 5.8.1.27561 does not
properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption,
and process crash) via a crafted XML document containing a large
number of nested entity references, aka Bug ID CSCtq78106, a similar
issue to CVE-2003-1564.
