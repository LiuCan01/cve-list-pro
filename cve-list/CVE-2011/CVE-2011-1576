The Generic Receive Offload (GRO) implementation in the Linux kernel
2.6.18 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 2.6.32 on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6, as used in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV)
Hypervisor and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service via crafted VLAN packets that are processed by the
napi_reuse_skb function, leading to (1) a memory leak or (2) memory
corruption, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1478.
