The ActiveBar1 ActiveX control in the Data Dynamics ActiveBar ActiveX
controls, as distributed in ActBar.ocx 1.0.6.5 in IBM Rational System
Architect 11.4.0.2, 11.4.0.1, and earlier, does not properly restrict
the SetLayoutData method, which allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a crafted Data argument, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2007-3883.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
