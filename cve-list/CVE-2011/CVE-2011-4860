The ComputePassword function in the Schneider Electric Quantum
Ethernet Module on the NOE 771 device (aka the Quantum 140NOE771*
module) generates the password for the fwupgrade account by performing
a calculation on the MAC address, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain access via a (1) ARP request message or (2)
Neighbor Solicitation message.
