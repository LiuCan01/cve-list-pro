The Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (aka CSRSS) in the Win32
subsystem in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003
SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, and Windows Server 2008 Gold and SP2
does not ensure that an unspecified array index has a non-negative
value before performing read and write operations, which allows local
users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) via a crafted application that triggers an incorrect
memory assignment for a user transaction, aka "CSRSS Local EOP
SrvSetConsoleNumberOfCommand Vulnerability."
