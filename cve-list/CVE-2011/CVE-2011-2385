The iPhoneHandle package 0.9.x before 0.9.7 and 1.0.x before 1.0.3 in
Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) does not properly restrict use of
the iPhoneHandle interface, which allows remote authenticated users to
gain privileges, and consequently read or modify OTRS core objects,
via unspecified vectors.
