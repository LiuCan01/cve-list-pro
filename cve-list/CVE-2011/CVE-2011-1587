Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MediaWiki before 1.16.4,
when Internet Explorer 6 or earlier is used, allows remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an uploaded file accessed
with a dangerous extension such as .html located before a ? (question
mark) in a query string, in conjunction with a modified URI path that
has a %2E sequence in place of the . (dot) character.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1578.
