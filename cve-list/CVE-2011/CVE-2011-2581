The ACL implementation in Cisco NX-OS 5.0(2) and 5.0(3) before
5.0(3)N2(1) on Nexus 5000 series switches, and NX-OS before
5.0(3)U1(2a) on Nexus 3000 series switches, does not properly handle
comments in conjunction with deny statements, which allows remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic
circumstances by sending packets, aka Bug IDs CSCto09813 and
CSCtr61490.
