slapd (aka ns-slapd) in 389 Directory Server before 1.2.8.a2 does not
properly manage the c_timelimit field of the connection table element,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
outage) via Simple Paged Results connections, as demonstrated by using
multiple processes to replay TCP sessions, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2011-0019.
