Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat (aka WeeChat) 0.3.4 and earlier does
not properly verify that the server hostname matches the domain name
of the subject of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof an SSL chat server via an arbitrary certificate,
related to incorrect use of the GnuTLS API.
