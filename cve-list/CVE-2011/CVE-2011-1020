The proc filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.37 and
earlier does not restrict access to the /proc directory tree of a
process after this process performs an exec of a setuid program, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial
of service via open, lseek, read, and write system calls.
