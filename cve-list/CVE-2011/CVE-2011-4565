Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in XOOPS 2.5.1.a,
and possibly earlier versions, allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) text parameter to
include/formdhtmltextarea_preview.php or (2) img BBCODE tag within the
message parameter to pmlite.php (aka Private Message).  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
