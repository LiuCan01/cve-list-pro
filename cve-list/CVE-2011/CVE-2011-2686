Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking,
which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the
values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number
sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to
CVE-2003-0900.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during
Ruby 1.8.6 development.
