The login form in Roundcube Webmail before 0.5.1 does not properly
handle a correctly authenticated but unintended login attempt, which
makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive
information by arranging for a victim to login to the attacker's
account and then compose an e-mail message, related to a "login CSRF"
issue.
