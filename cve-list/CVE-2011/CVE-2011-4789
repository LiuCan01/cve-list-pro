Stack-based buffer overflow in magentservice.exe in the server in HP
LoadRunner 11.00 before patch 4 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a crafted size value in a packet.  NOTE: it was
originally reported that the affected product is HP Diagnostics
Server, but HP states that "the vulnerable product is actually HP
LoadRunner."
