Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Support
Incident Tracker (aka SiT!) 3.65 allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the file name to
incident_attachments.php; (2) unspecified vectors in link_add.php,
possibly involving origref, linkref, linktype parameters, which are
not properly handled in the clean_int function in lib/base.inc.php, or
the redirect parameter, which is not properly handled in the
html_redirect function in lib/html.inc.php; and (3) unspecified
vectors in translate.php.
