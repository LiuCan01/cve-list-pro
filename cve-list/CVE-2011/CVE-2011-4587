lib/moodlelib.php in Moodle 1.9.x before 1.9.15, 2.0.x before 2.0.6,
and 2.1.x before 2.1.3 does not properly handle certain zero values in
the password policy, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
obtain access by leveraging the possible existence of user accounts
that have unchangeable blank passwords.
