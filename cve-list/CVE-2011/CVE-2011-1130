Simple Machines Forum (SMF) before 1.1.13, and 2.x before 2.0 RC5,
does not properly validate the start parameter, which might allow
remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks, obtain sensitive
information, or cause a denial of service via a crafted value, related
to the cleanRequest function in QueryString.php and the
constructPageIndex function in Subs.php.
