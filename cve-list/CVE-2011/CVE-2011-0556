The Font Xtra.x32 module in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.9.620
allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) via a crafted PFR1 chunk that leads to an
unexpected sign extension and an invalid pointer dereference, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0569.
