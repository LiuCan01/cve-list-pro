The "Save for Web" selection in QuickTime Player in Apple Mac OS X
through 10.6.8 exports HTML documents that contain an http link to a
script file, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by spoofing the http server during
local viewing of an exported document.
