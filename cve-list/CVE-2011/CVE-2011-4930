Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Condor 7.2.0 through 7.6.4,
and possibly certain 7.7.x versions, as used in Red Hat MRG Grid and
possibly other products, allow local users to cause a denial of
service (condor_schedd daemon and failure to launch jobs) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in (1) the reason
for a hold for a job that uses an XML user log, (2) the filename of a
file to be transferred, and possibly other unspecified vectors.
