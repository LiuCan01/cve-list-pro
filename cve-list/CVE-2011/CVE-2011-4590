The web services implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and 2.1.x
before 2.1.3 does not properly consider the maintenance-mode state and
account attributes during login attempts, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by
connecting to a webservice server.
