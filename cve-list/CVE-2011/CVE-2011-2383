Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and earlier does not properly restrict
cross-zone drag-and-drop actions, which allows user-assisted remote
attackers to read cookie files via vectors involving an IFRAME element
with a SRC attribute containing an http: URL that redirects to a file:
URL, as demonstrated by a Facebook game, related to a "cookiejacking"
issue, aka "Drag and Drop Information Disclosure Vulnerability." NOTE:
this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix in the Internet
Explorer 9 release.
