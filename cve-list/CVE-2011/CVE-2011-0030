The Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) in Microsoft Windows XP
SP2 and SP3 and Server 2003 SP2 does not properly kill processes after
a logout, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information or
gain privileges via a crafted application that continues to execute
throughout the logout of one user and the login session of the next
user, aka "CSRSS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2010-0023.
