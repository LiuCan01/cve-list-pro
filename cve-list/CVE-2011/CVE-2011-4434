Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1
do not properly enforce AppLocker rules, which allows local users to
bypass intended access restrictions via a (1) macro or (2) scripting
feature in an application, as demonstrated by Microsoft Office
applications and the SANDBOX_INERT and LOAD_IGNORE_CODE_AUTHZ_LEVEL
flags.
