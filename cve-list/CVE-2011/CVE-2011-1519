The remote console in the Server Controller in IBM Lotus Domino 7.x
and 8.x verifies credentials against a file located at a UNC share
pathname specified by the client, which allows remote attackers to
bypass authentication, and consequently execute arbitrary code, by
placing this pathname in the COOKIEFILE field.  NOTE: this might
overlap CVE-2011-0920.
