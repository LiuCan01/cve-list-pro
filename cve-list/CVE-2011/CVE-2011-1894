The MHTML protocol handler in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3,
Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server
2008 Gold, SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not
properly handle a MIME format in a request for embedded content in an
HTML document, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted EMBED element in a web page that
is visited in Internet Explorer, aka "MHTML Mime-Formatted Request
Vulnerability."
