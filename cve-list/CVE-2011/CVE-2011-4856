The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.4.4_build20111103.18
sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which
might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by
leveraging an interpretation conflict involving
admin/health/parameters and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible
that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this
issue.
