The Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in
WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running in
environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not
enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows
remote attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
involving hostnames that are not properly validated.  NOTE: it could be
argued that this is a design limitation of the Net::HTTPS API, and
separate implementations should be independently assigned CVE
identifiers for not working around this limitation. However, because
this API was modified within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been
assigned.
