The helper application in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
(formerly AnyConnect VPN Client) before 2.5.3041, and 3.0.x before
3.0.629, on Linux and Mac OS X downloads a client executable file
(vpndownloader.exe) without verifying its authenticity, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the url property to a
Java applet, aka Bug ID CSCsy05934.
