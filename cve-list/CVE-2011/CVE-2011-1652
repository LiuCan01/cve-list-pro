** DISPUTED ** The default configuration of Microsoft Windows 7
immediately prefers a new IPv6 and DHCPv6 service over a currently
used IPv4 and DHCPv4 service upon receipt of an IPv6 Router
Advertisement (RA), and does not provide an option to ignore an
unexpected RA, which allows remote attackers to conduct
man-in-the-middle attacks on communication with external IPv4 servers
via vectors involving RAs, a DHCPv6 server, and NAT-PT on the local
network, aka a "SLAAC Attack." NOTE: it can be argued that preferring
IPv6 complies with RFC 3484, and that attempting to determine the
legitimacy of an RA is currently outside the scope of recommended
behavior of host operating systems.
