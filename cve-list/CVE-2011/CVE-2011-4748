The billing system for Parallels Plesk Panel 10.3.1_build1013110726.09
has web pages containing e-mail addresses that are not intended for
correspondence about the local application deployment, which allows
remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by
reading a page, as demonstrated by js/ajax/core/ajax.inc.js and
certain other files.
