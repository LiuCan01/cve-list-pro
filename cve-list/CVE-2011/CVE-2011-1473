** DISPUTED ** OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through 1.x, does not
properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and
TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many
renegotiations within a single connection, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2011-5094.  NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the
responsibility of server deployments, not a security library, to
prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a
specific environment.
