The Site Editor (aka SiteBuilder) feature in Parallels Plesk Small
Business Panel 10.2.0 has web pages containing e-mail addresses that
are not intended for correspondence about the local application
deployment, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially
sensitive information by reading a page, as demonstrated by
js/Wizard/Status.js and certain other files.
