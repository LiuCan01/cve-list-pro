The cat6000-dot1x component in Cisco IOS 12.2 before 12.2(33)SXI7 does
not properly handle an external loop between a pair of dot1x enabled
ports, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(traffic storm) via unspecified vectors that trigger many unicast
EAPoL Protocol Data Units (PDUs), aka Bug ID CSCtq36336.
