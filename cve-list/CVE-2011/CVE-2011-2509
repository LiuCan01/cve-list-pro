Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Joomla! before
1.6.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via (1) the query string to the com_contact component, as demonstrated
by the Itemid parameter to index.php; (2) the query string to the
com_content component, as demonstrated by the filter_order parameter
to index.php; (3) the query string to the com_newsfeeds component, as
demonstrated by an arbitrary parameter to index.php; or (4) the option
parameter in a reset.request action to index.php; and, when Internet
Explorer or Konqueror is used, (5) allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the searchword parameter in a search
action to index.php in the com_search component.
