IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine (aka P8CE) 4.0.1 through 5.0.0, as used
in FileNet P8 Content Manager (CM) and FileNet P8 Business Process
Manager (BPM), does not require the PRIVILEGED_WRITE access role for
all intended Object Store modifications, which allows remote attackers
to change a privileged property of an object via unspecified vectors.
