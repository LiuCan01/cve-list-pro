The STARTTLS implementation in Kerio Connect 7.1.4 build 2985 and
MailServer 6.x does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP
sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is
in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar
issue to CVE-2011-0411.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
