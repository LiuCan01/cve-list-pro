actions/files/files.php in WikkaWiki 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, when
INTRANET_MODE is enabled, supports file uploads for file extensions
that are typically absent from an Apache HTTP Server TypesConfig file,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code by placing this code in a file whose name has multiple
extensions, as demonstrated by a (1) .mm or (2) .vpp file.
