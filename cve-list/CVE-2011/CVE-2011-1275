Microsoft Excel 2002 SP3; Office 2004, 2008, and 2011 for Mac; and
Open XML File Format Converter for Mac do not properly validate record

attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) via a crafted spreadsheet, aka "Excel Memory Heap
Overwrite Vulnerability."
