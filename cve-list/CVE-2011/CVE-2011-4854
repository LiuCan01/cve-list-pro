The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.4.4_build20111103.18
does not ensure that Content-Type HTTP headers match the corresponding
Content-Type data in HTML META elements, which might allow remote
attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an
interpretation conflict involving the get_enabled_product_icon
program.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk
product, could be affected by this issue.
