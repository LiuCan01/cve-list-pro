Integer signedness error in the base64_decode function in the HTTP
authentication functionality (http_auth.c) in lighttpd 1.4 before
1.4.30 and 1.5 before SVN revision 2806 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via crafted base64
input that triggers an out-of-bounds read with a negative index.
