The Java Servlet framework on Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch
(CTMS) devices with software 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.5.x, and 1.6.x does not
require administrative authentication for unspecified actions, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted
request, aka Bug ID CSCtf01253.
