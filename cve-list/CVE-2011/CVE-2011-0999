mm/huge_memory.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38-rc5 does not
prevent creation of a transparent huge page (THP) during the existence
of a temporary stack for an exec system call, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted application.
