The CSRF protection mechanism in Django through 1.2.7 and 1.3.x
through 1.3.1 does not properly handle web-server configurations
supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers, which allows remote attackers
to trigger unauthenticated forged requests via vectors involving a DNS
CNAME record and a web page containing JavaScript code.
