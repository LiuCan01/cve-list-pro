Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology
component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.3.2.0 and 8.3.5.0 allows
context-dependent attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and
availability via unknown vectors related to Outside In Filters.  NOTE:
the previous information was obtained from the July 2011 CPU.  Oracle
has not commented on claims from a reliable third party that this is a
stack-based buffer overflow in the imcdr2.flt library for the
CorelDRAW parser.
