Tcpip.sys in the TCP/IP stack in Microsoft Windows 7 Gold and SP1 and
Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 does not properly implement
URL-based QoS, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (reboot) via a crafted URL to a web server, aka "TCP/IP QOS
Denial of Service Vulnerability."
