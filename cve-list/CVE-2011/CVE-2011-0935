The PKI functionality in Cisco IOS 15.0 and 15.1 does not prevent
permanent caching of certain public keys, which allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication and have unspecified other impact
by leveraging an IKE peer relationship in which a key was previously
valid but later revoked, aka Bug ID CSCth82164, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2010-4685.
