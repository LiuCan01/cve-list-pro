The server in Microsoft Active Directory on Windows Server 2003 SP2
does not properly handle an update request for a service principal
name (SPN), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(authentication downgrade or outage) via a crafted request that
triggers name collisions, aka "Active Directory SPN Validation
Vulnerability."
