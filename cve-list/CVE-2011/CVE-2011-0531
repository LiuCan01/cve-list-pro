demux/mkv/mkv.hpp in the MKV demuxer plugin in VideoLAN VLC media
player 1.1.6.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) and execute arbitrary commands via a crafted MKV
(WebM or Matroska) file that triggers memory corruption, related to
"class mismatching" and the MKV_IS_ID macro.
