gnomesu-pam-backend in libgnomesu 1.0.0 prints an error message but
proceeds with the non-error code path upon failure of the setgid or
setuid function, which allows local users to gain privileges by
leveraging access to two unprivileged user accounts, and running many
processes under one of these accounts.
