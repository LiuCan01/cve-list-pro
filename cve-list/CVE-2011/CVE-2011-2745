upload_handler.php in the swfupload extension in Chyrp 2.0 and earlier
relies on client-side JavaScript code to restrict the file extensions
of uploaded files, which allows remote authenticated users to upload a
.php file, and consequently execute arbitrary PHP code, via a
write_post action to the default URI under admin/.
