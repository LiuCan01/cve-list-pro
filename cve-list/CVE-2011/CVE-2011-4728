The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel
10.2.0_build1011110331.18 does not set the secure flag for a cookie in
an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http
session, as demonstrated by cookies used by login_up.php3 and certain
other files.
