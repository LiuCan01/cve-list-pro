Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not use the forceloginforprofiles
setting for course-profiles access control, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via
vectors involving use of a search engine, as demonstrated by the
search functionality of Google, Yahoo!, Wrensoft Zoom, MSN, Yandex,
and AltaVista.
