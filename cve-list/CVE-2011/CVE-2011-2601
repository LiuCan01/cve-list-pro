The GPU support functionality in Mac OS X does not properly restrict
rendering time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (desktop hang) via vectors involving WebGL and (1) shader
programs or (2) complex 3D geometry, as demonstrated by using Mozilla
Firefox or Google Chrome to visit the lots-of-polys-example.html test
page in the Khronos WebGL SDK.
