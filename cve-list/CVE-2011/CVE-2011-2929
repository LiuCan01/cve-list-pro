The template selection functionality in
actionpack/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x
before 3.0.10 and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc6 does not properly handle glob
characters, which allows remote attackers to render arbitrary views
via a crafted URL, related to a "filter skipping vulnerability."
