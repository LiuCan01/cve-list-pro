The vulnerable-passwords script in Best Practical Solutions RT 3.x
before 3.8.12 and 4.x before 4.0.6 does not update the password-hash
algorithm for disabled user accounts, which makes it easier for
context-dependent attackers to determine cleartext passwords, and
possibly use these passwords after accounts are re-enabled, via a
brute-force attack on the database.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-0009.
