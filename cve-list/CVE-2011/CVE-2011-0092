The LZW stream decompression functionality in ORMELEMS.DLL in
Microsoft Visio 2002 SP2, 2003 SP3, and 2007 SP2 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Visio file with a malformed
VisioDocument stream that triggers an exception handler that accesses
an object that has not been fully initialized, which triggers memory
corruption, aka "Visio Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
