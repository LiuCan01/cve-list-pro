The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in Cisco IOS on
unspecified switches allows remote attackers to bypass the Router
Advertisement Guarding functionality via a fragmented IPv6 packet in
which the Router Advertisement (RA) message is contained in the second
fragment, as demonstrated by (1) a packet in which the first fragment
contains a long Destination Options extension header or (2) a packet
in which the first fragment contains an ICMPv6 Echo Request message.
