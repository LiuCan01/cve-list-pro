sp5xdec.c in the Sunplus SP5X JPEG decoder in libavcodec in FFmpeg
before 0.6.3 and libav through 0.6.2, as used in VideoLAN VLC media
player 1.1.9 and earlier and other products, performs a write
operation outside the bounds of an unspecified array, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed AMV file.
