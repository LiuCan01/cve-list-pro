The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7,
when generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option
in ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow
remote attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it
easier to conduct hash collision attacks.
