Google Chrome before 8.0.552.237 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.344 do
not properly handle Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences in
conjunction with CANVAS elements, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."
