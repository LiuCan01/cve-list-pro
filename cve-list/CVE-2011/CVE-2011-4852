The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.4.4_build20111103.18
generates web pages containing external links in response to GET
requests with query strings for enterprise/mobile-monitor/ and certain
other files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information by reading (1) web-server access logs or (2)
web-server Referer logs, related to a "cross-domain Referer leakage"
issue.
