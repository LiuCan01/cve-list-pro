The virtio_queue_notify in qemu-kvm 0.14.0 and earlier does not
properly validate the virtqueue number, which allows guest users to
cause a denial of service (guest crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a negative number in the Queue Notify field of the Virtio
Header, which bypasses a signed comparison.
