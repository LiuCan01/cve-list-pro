A certain ActiveX control in CSDWebInstaller.ocx in Cisco Secure
Desktop (CSD) does not properly verify the signature of an unspecified
downloaded program, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code by spoofing the CSD installation process, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2010-0589.
