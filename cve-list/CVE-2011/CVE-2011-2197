The cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention feature in Ruby on Rails 2.x
before 2.3.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.8, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc2 does not
properly handle mutation of safe buffers, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via crafted strings to an
application that uses a problematic string method, as demonstrated by
the sub method.
