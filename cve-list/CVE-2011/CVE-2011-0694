RealNetworks RealPlayer 11.0 through 11.1, SP 1.0 through 1.1.5, and
14.0.0 through 14.0.1, and Enterprise 2.0 through 2.1.4, uses
predictable names for temporary files, which allows remote attackers
to conduct cross-domain scripting attacks and execute arbitrary code
via the OpenURLinPlayerBrowser function.
