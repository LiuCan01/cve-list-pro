The Data Security component in Apple iOS before 4.2.10 and 4.3.x
before 4.3.5 does not check the basicConstraints parameter during
validation of X.509 certificate chains, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof an SSL server by using a non-CA certificate to sign
a certificate for an arbitrary domain.
