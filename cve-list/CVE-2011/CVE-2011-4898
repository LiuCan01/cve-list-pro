** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component
in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier generates different error messages for
requests lacking a dbname parameter depending on whether the MySQL
credentials are valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
conduct brute-force attacks via a series of requests with different
uname and pwd parameters.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance
of this issue; also, it is unclear whether providing intentionally
vague error messages during installation would be reasonable from a
usability perspective.
