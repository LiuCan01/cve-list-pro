Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4768
Phase: Assigned (20111211)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:http://xss.cx/examples/plesk-reports/plesk-10.2.0-site-editor.html

The Site Editor (aka SiteBuilder) feature in Parallels Plesk Small
Business Panel 10.2.0 omits the Content-Type header's charset
parameter for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to
have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict
involving Wizard/Edit/Modules/Image and certain other files.  NOTE: it
is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be
affected by this issue.
