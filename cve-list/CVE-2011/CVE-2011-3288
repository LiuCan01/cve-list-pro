Reference: CISCO:20110928 Jabber Extensible Communications Platform and Cisco Unified Presence XML Denial of Service Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a0080b95d47.shtml

Cisco Unified Presence before 8.5(4) does not properly detect
recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption, and process
crash) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested
entity references, aka Bug IDs CSCtq89842 and CSCtq88547, a similar
issue to CVE-2003-1564.
