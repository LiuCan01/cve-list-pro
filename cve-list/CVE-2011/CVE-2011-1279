Microsoft Excel 2002 SP3 and 2003 SP3, Office 2004 and 2008 for Mac,
and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac do not properly validate
record information during parsing of Excel spreadsheets, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) via a crafted spreadsheet, aka "Excel Out
of Bounds WriteAV Vulnerability."
