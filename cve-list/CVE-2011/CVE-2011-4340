Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Symphony CMS
2.2.3 and possibly other versions before 2.2.4 allow remote
authenticated users with Author privileges to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via (1) the profile parameter to
extensions/profiledevkit/content/content.profile.php, as demonstrated
via requests to (a) the default URI, (b) about/, or (c) drafts/; or
(2) the filter parameter in symphony/lib/core/class.symphony.php, as
demonstrated via requests to (d) symphony/publish/comments or (e)
symphony/publish/images.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
