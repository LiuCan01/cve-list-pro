The JIT compiler in Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Gold and SP1, 3.5.1,
and 4.0, when IsJITOptimizerDisabled is false, does not properly
handle expressions related to null strings, which allows
context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions,
and consequently execute arbitrary code, in opportunistic
circumstances by leveraging a crafted application, as demonstrated by
(1) a crafted XAML browser application (aka XBAP), (2) a crafted
ASP.NET application, or (3) a crafted .NET Framework application, aka
".NET Framework JIT Optimization Vulnerability."
