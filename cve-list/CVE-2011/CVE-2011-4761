Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 omits the Content-Type
header's charset parameter for certain resources, which might allow
remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an
interpretation conflict involving domains/sitebuilder_edit.php and
certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the
SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
