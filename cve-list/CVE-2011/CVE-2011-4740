The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20
generates web pages containing external links in response to GET
requests with query strings for
smb/app/search-data/catalogId/marketplace and certain other files,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by reading (1) web-server access logs or (2) web-server
Referer logs, related to a "cross-domain Referer leakage" issue.
