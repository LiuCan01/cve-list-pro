IBM solidDB 4.5.x before 4.5.182, 6.0.x before 6.0.1069, 6.1.x and
6.3.x before 6.3 FP8 (aka 6.3.49), and 6.5.x before 6.5 FP4 (aka
6.5.0.4) does not properly handle the (1) rpc_test_svc_readwrite and
(2) rpc_test_svc_done commands, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a
crafted command.
