Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in incident_attachments.php in
Support Incident Tracker (aka SiT!) 3.65 allows remote authenticated
users to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable
extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in
unspecified directory, a different program than CVE-2011-3833.
