Mozilla Firefox before 3.6.24 and 4.x through 7.0 and Thunderbird
before 3.1.6 and 5.0 through 7.0 do not properly handle JavaScript
files that contain many functions, which allows user-assisted remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted file that is accessed by debugging APIs, as demonstrated by
Firebug.
