Use-after-free vulnerability in Apple Safari 5.1.2, when a plug-in
with a blocking function is installed, allows user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page that is
accessed during user interaction with the plug-in, leading to improper
coordination between an API call and the plug-in unloading
functionality, as demonstrated by the Adobe Flash and RealPlayer
plug-ins.
