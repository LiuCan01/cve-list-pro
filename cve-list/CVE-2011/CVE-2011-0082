The X.509 certificate validation functionality in Mozilla Firefox
4.0.x through 4.0.1 does not properly implement single-session
security exceptions, which might make it easier for user-assisted
remote attackers to spoof an SSL server via an untrusted certificate
that triggers potentially unwanted local caching of documents from
that server.
