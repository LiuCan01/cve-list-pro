connection.c in Bip before 0.8.9 does not properly close sockets,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file
descriptor consumption and crash) via multiple failed SSL handshakes,
a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4550.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT
from CVE-2013-4550 because it is a different type of issue.
