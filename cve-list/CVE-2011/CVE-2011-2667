Icihttp.exe in CA Gateway Security for HTTP, as used in CA Gateway
Security 8.1 before 8.1.0.69 and CA Total Defense r12, does not
properly parse URLs, which allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption
and daemon crash) via a malformed request.
