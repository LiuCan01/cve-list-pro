The (1) JScript 5.8 and (2) VBScript 5.8 scripting engines in
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 do not properly load
decoded scripts obtained from web pages, which allows remote attackers
to trigger memory corruption and consequently obtain sensitive
information via a crafted web site, aka "Scripting Engines Information
Disclosure Vulnerability."
