dexdump in Android SDK before 2.3 does not properly perform structural
verification, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (dexdump crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a malformed APK or dex file that calls a method using more
arguments than the number of register that have been declared for that
method.
