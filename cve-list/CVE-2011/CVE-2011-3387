The class file parser in IBM Java 1.4.2 SR13 FP9 allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption
or an infinite loop) via a crafted attribute length field in a class
file, related to validation of a length field at the wrong time, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0311.
