Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the tsc_launch_remote
function (src/support.c) in Terminal Server Client (tsclient) 0.150,
and possibly other versions, allow user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a .RDP file with a long (1) username, (2)
password, or (3) domain argument.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
party information.
