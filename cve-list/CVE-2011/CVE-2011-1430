The STARTTLS implementation in the server in Ipswitch IMail 11.03 and
earlier does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP
sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is
in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar
issue to CVE-2011-0411.
