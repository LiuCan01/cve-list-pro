** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component
in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier does not ensure that the specified
MySQL database service is appropriate, which allows remote attackers
to configure an arbitrary database via the dbhost and dbname
parameters, and subsequently conduct static code injection and
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via (1) an HTTP request or (2) a
MySQL query.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue;
however, remote code execution makes the issue important in many
realistic environments.
