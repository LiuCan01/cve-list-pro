The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and
earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be
limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
