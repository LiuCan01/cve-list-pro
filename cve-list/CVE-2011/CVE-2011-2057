Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SX/release/notes/caveats_SXI_rebuilds.html

The cat6000-dot1x component in Cisco IOS 12.2 before 12.2(33)SXI7 does
not properly handle (1) a loop between a dot1x enabled port and an
open-authentication dot1x enabled port and (2) a loop between a dot1x
enabled port and a non-dot1x port, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (traffic storm) via unspecified vectors that
trigger many Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Bridge Protocol Data Unit
(BPDU) frames, aka Bug ID CSCtq36327.
