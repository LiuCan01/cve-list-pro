Unspecified vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player 11.1.102.55 on Windows
and Mac OS X allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted SWF file, as demonstrated by the first of two vulnerabilities
exploited by the Intevydis vd_adobe_fp module in VulnDisco Step Ahead
(SA).  NOTE: as of 20111207, this disclosure has no actionable
information. However, because the module author is a reliable
researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking
purposes.
