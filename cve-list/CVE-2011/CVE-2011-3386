Unspecified vulnerability in Medtronic Paradigm wireless insulin pump
512, 522, 712, and 722 allows remote attackers to modify the delivery
of an insulin bolus dose and cause a denial of service (adverse human
health effects) via unspecified vectors involving wireless
communications and knowledge of the device's serial number, as
demonstrated by Jerome Radcliffe at the Black Hat USA conference in
August 2011.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed the severity of this issue,
saying "we believe the risk of deliberate, malicious, or unauthorized
manipulation of medical devices is extremely low... we strongly
believe it would be extremely difficult for a third-party to
wirelessly tamper with your insulin pump... you would be able to
detect tones on the insulin pump that weren't intentionally programmed
and could intervene accordingly."
