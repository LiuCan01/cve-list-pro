The default configuration of udev on Linux does not warn the user
before enabling additional Human Interface Device (HID) functionality
over USB, which allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary
programs via crafted USB data, as demonstrated by keyboard and mouse
data sent by malware on a smartphone that the user connected to the
computer.
