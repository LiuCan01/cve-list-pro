Integer overflow in WebKit, as used on the Research In Motion (RIM)
BlackBerry Torch 9800 with firmware 6.0.0.246, in Google Chrome before
10.0.648.133, and in Apple Safari before 5.0.5, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to CSS
"style handling," nodesets, and a length value, as demonstrated by
Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann during a
Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2011.
