Cisco TelePresence Recording Server devices with software 1.6.x and
Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch (CTMS) devices with software
1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.5.x, and 1.6.x do not properly restrict remote access
to the Java servlet RMI interface, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption and web outage) via
multiple crafted requests, aka Bug IDs CSCtg35830 and CSCtg35825.
