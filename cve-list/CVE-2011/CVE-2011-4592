The command-line cron implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and
2.1.x before 2.1.3 does not properly interact with IP blocking, which
might allow remote attackers to bypass intended IP address
restrictions by leveraging a configuration in which IP blocking was
disabled to restore cron functionality.
