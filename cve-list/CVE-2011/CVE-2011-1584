The updateFile function in inc/core/class.dc.media.php in the Media
Manager in Dotclear before 2.2.3 does not properly restrict pathnames,
which allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute
arbitrary PHP code via the media_path or media_file parameter.  NOTE:
some of these details are obtained from third party information.
