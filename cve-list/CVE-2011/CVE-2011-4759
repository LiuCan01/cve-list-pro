Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 generates web pages
containing external links in response to GET requests with query
strings for client@1/domain@1/hosting/file-manager/ and certain other
files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by reading (1) web-server access logs or (2) web-server
Referer logs, related to a "cross-domain Referer leakage" issue.
