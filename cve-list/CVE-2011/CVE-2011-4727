The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel
10.2.0_build1011110331.18 does not properly validate string data that
is intended for storage in an XML document, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (parsing error) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via a crafted REST URL parameter, as
demonstrated by parameters to admin/ and certain other files.
