Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in config.c in
config.cgi in Icinga before 1.4.1, when escape_html_tags is disabled,
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
JavaScript expression, as demonstrated by the onload attribute of a
BODY element located after a check-host-alive! sequence, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-2179.
