TimThumb (timthumb.php) before 2.0 does not validate the entire source
with the domain white list, which allows remote attackers to upload
and execute arbitrary code via a URL containing a white-listed domain
in the src parameter, then accessing it via a direct request to the
file in the cache directory, as exploited in the wild in August 2011.
