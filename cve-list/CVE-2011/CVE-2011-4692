WebKit, as used in Apple Safari 5.1.1 and earlier and Google Chrome 15
and earlier, does not prevent capture of data about the time required
for image loading, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
determine whether an image exists in the browser cache via crafted
JavaScript code, as demonstrated by visipisi.
