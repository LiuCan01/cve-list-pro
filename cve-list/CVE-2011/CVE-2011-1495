drivers/scsi/mpt2sas/mpt2sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.38 and
earlier does not validate (1) length and (2) offset values before
performing memory copy operations, which might allow local users to
gain privileges, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted ioctl
call, related to the _ctl_do_mpt_command and _ctl_diag_read_buffer
functions.
