The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel
10.2.0_build1011110331.18 sends incorrect Content-Type headers for
certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an
unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving
smb/admin-home/disable-featured-applications-promo and certain other
files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product,
could be affected by this issue.
