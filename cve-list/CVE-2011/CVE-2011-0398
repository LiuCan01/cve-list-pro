The Piwik_Common::getIP function in Piwik before 1.1 does not properly
determine the client IP address, which allows remote attackers to
bypass intended geolocation and logging functionality via (1) use of a
private (aka RFC 1918) address behind a proxy server or (2) spoofing
of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.
