The Site Editor (aka SiteBuilder) feature in Parallels Plesk Small
Business Panel 10.2.0 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a
Set-Cookie header for a cookie, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script
access to this cookie, as demonstrated by cookies used by
Wizard/Edit/Modules/ImageGallery/MultiImagesUpload and certain other
files.
