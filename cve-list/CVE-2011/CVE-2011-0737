** DISPUTED ** Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 CHF1 and earlier allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information via an id=- query to a .cfm
file, which reveals the installation path in an error message.  NOTE:
the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because the
Site-wide Error Handler and Debug Output Settings sections of the
ColdFusion Lockdown guide explain the requirement for settings that
prevent this information disclosure.
