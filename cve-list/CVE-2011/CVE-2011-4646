SQL injection vulnerability in wp-postratings.php in the
WP-PostRatings plugin 1.50, 1.61, and probably other versions before
1.62 for WordPress allows remote authenticated users with the Author
role to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the id attribute of the
ratings shortcode when creating a post.  NOTE: some of these details
are obtained from third party information.
