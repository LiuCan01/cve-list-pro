Reference: URL:http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=928

The NSEPA.NsepaCtrl.1 ActiveX control in nsepa.ocx in Citrix Access
Gateway Enterprise Edition 8.1 before 8.1-67.7, 9.0 before 9.0-70.5,
and 9.1 before 9.1-96.4 attempts to validate signed DLLs by checking

data referencing a DLL that was signed with a crafted certificate.
