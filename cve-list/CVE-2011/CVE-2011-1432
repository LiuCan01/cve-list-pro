The STARTTLS implementation in SCO SCOoffice Server does not properly
restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
insert commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a
"plaintext command injection" attack, a similar issue to
CVE-2011-0411.
