Reference: MISC:http://xss.cx/examples/plesk-reports/plesk-redhat-el6-psa-10.2.0-build-1011110331.18-xss-sqli-cwe79-cwe89-javascript-injection-exception-example-poc-report-paros-burp-suite-pro-1.4.1.html

The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel
10.2.0_build1011110331.18 omits the Content-Type header's charset
parameter for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to
have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict
involving account/power-mode-logout and certain other files.  NOTE: it
is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be
affected by this issue.
