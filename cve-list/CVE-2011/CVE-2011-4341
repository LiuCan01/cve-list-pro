Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in
symphony/content/content.publish.php in Symphony CMS 2.2.3 and
possibly other versions before 2.2.4 allow remote authenticated users
with Author permissions to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the
filter parameter to (1) symphony/publish/comments or (2)
symphony/publish/images.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to perform
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via error messages.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
