Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in inc/tesmodrewite.php in CF
Image Hosting Script 1.3.82, 1.4.1, and probably other versions before
1.4.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
via the q parameter.  NOTE: this was originally reported as a file
disclosure vulnerability, but this is likely inaccurate.
