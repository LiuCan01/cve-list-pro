The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20
omits the Content-Type header's charset parameter for certain
resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified
impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving
smb/user/create and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that
only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this issue.
