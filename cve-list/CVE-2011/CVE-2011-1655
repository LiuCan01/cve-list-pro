The management.asmx module in the Management Web Service in the
Unified Network Control (UNC) Server in CA Total Defense (TD) r12
before SE2 sends a cleartext response to unspecified
getDBConfigSettings requests, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain database credentials, and subsequently execute
arbitrary code, by sniffing the network, related to the UNCWS Web
Service.
