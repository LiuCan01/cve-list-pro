The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64
and 2.2.x before 2.2.18, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place,
does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2)
ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy,
which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers by
using the HTTP/0.9 protocol with a malformed URI containing an initial
@ (at sign) character.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.
