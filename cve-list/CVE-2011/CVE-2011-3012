The ioQuake3 engine, as used in World of Padman 1.2 and earlier,
Tremulous 1.1.0, and ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20, does not check for
dangerous file extensions before writing to the quake3 directory,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted
third-party addon that creates a Trojan horse DLL file, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-2764.
