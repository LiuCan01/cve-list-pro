2008, and 2011 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and
Excel Viewer SP2 do not properly handle errors during the parsing of
Office Art records in Excel spreadsheets, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed object record,
related to a "stray reference," aka "Excel Linked List Corruption
Vulnerability."
