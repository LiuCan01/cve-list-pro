The DOM level 2 implementation in WebKit, as used in Apple iTunes
before 10.2 on Windows and Apple Safari, does not properly handle DOM
manipulations associated with event listeners during processing of
range objects, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
application crash) via vectors related to iTunes Store browsing, a
different vulnerability than other CVEs listed in
APPLE-SA-2011-03-02-1.
