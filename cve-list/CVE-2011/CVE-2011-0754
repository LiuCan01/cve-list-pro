Reference: XF:php-splfileinfogettype-symlink(65429)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/65429

The SplFileInfo::getType function in the Standard PHP Library (SPL)
extension in PHP before 5.3.4 on Windows does not properly detect
symbolic links, which might make it easier for local users to conduct
symlink attacks by leveraging cross-platform differences in the stat
structure, related to lack of a FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT check.
