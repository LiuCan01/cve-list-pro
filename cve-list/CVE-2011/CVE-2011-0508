Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
system/modules/comments/Comments.php in Contao CMS 2.9.2, and possibly
other versions before 2.9.3, allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the HTTP X_FORWARDED_FOR header,
which is stored by system/libraries/Environment.php but not properly
handled by a comments action to main.php.
