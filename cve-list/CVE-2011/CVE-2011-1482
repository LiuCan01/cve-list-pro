Reference: MISC:http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/advisories/[phpnuke-8.x]_cross_site_request_forgery

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
mainfile.php in Francisco Burzi PHP-Nuke 8.0 and earlier allow remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests
that (1) add user accounts or (2) grant the administrative privilege
to a user account, related to a Referer check that uses a substring
comparison.
