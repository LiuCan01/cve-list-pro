A certain Red Hat patch to the __br_deliver function in
net/bridge/br_forward.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.18 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact by leveraging connectivity to a network
interface that uses an Ethernet bridge device.
