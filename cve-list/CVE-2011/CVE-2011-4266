Untrusted search path vulnerability in FFFTP before 1.98d allows local
users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse executable file in a
directory that is accessed for reading an extensionless file, as
demonstrated by executing the README.exe file when a user attempts to
access the README file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3991.
