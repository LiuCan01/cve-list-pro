The Red Hat mkdumprd script for kexec-tools, as distributed in the
kexec-tools 1.x before 1.102pre-154 and 2.x before 2.0.0-209 packages
in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, includes all of root's SSH private keys
within a vmcore file, which allows context-dependent attackers to
obtain sensitive information by inspecting the file content.
