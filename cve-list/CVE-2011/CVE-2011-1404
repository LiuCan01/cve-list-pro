Mahara before 1.3.6 does not properly restrict the data in responses
to AJAX calls, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain
sensitive information via a request associated with (1)
blocktype/myfriends/myfriends.json.php, (2) json/usersearch.php, (3)
group/membersearchresults.json.php, or (4) json/friendsearch.php, as
demonstrated by information about friends and e-mail addresses.
