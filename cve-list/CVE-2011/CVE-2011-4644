Splunk 4.2.5 and earlier, when a Free license is selected, enables
potentially undesirable functionality within an environment that
intentionally does not support authentication, which allows remote
attackers to (1) read arbitrary files via a management-console session
that leverages the ability to create crafted data sources, or (2)
execute management commands via an HTTP request.
