** DISPUTED ** Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.x, with
certain settings of the SSL_ENABLE_RENEGOTIATION option, does not
properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and
TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many
renegotiations within a single connection, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2011-1473.  NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the
responsibility of server deployments, not a security library, to
prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a
specific environment.
