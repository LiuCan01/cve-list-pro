Openswan 2.2.x does not properly restrict permissions for (1)
/var/run/starter.pid, related to starter.c in the IPsec starter, and
(2) /var/lock/subsys/ipsec, which allows local users to kill arbitrary
processes by writing a PID to a file, or possibly bypass disk quotas
by writing arbitrary data to a file, as demonstrated by files with
0666 permissions, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1784.
