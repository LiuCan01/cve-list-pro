Cisco TelePresence Software before TE 4.1.1 on the Cisco IP Video
Phone E20 has a default password for the root account after an upgrade
to TE 4.1.0, which makes it easier for remote attackers to modify the
configuration via an SSH session, aka Bug ID CSCtw69889, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2011-2555.
