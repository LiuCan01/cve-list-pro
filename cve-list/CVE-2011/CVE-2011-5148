Multiple incomplete blacklist vulnerabilities in the Simple File
Upload (mod_simplefileuploadv1.3) module before 1.3.5 for Joomla!
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file
with a (1) php5, (2) php6, or (3) double (e.g. .php.jpg) extension,
then accessing it via a direct request to the file in images/, as
exploited in the wild in January 2012.
