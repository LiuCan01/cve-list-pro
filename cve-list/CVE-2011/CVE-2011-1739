The makemask function in mountd.c in mountd in FreeBSD 7.4 through 8.2
does not properly handle a -network field specifying a CIDR block with
a prefix length that is not an integer multiple of 8, which allows
remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in
opportunistic circumstances via an NFS mount request.
