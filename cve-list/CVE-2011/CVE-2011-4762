Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 sends incorrect
Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote
attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an
interpretation conflict involving smb/app/top-categories-data/ and
certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the
SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
