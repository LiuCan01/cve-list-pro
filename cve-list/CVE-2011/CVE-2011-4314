message/ax/AxMessage.java in OpenID4Java before 0.9.6 final, as used
in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1 before 5.1.2, Step2, Kay
Framework before 1.0.2, and possibly other products does not verify
that Attribute Exchange (AX) information is signed, which allows
remote attackers to modify potentially sensitive AX information
without detection via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
