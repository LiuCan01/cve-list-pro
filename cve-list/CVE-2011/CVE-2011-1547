Multiple stack consumption vulnerabilities in the kernel in NetBSD
4.0, 5.0 before 5.0.3, and 5.1 before 5.1.1, when IPsec is enabled,
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted (1)
IPv4 or (2) IPv6 packet with nested IPComp headers.
