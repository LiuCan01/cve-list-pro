The login page of IDSWebApp in the Web Administration Tool in IBM
Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.2 before 6.2.0.3-TIV-ITDS-IF0004 does
not have an off autocomplete attribute for authentication fields,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by
leveraging an unattended workstation.
