The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR::Packer module before 1.012 for
Perl creates temporary files in a directory with a predictable name
without verifying ownership and permissions of this directory, which
allows local users to overwrite files when another user extracts a PAR
packed program.  NOTE: a similar vulnerability was reported for PAR,
but this has been assigned a different CVE identifier.
