Reference: MISC:http://www.mh-sec.de/downloads/mh-RA_flooding_CVE-2010-multiple.txt

The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and possibly other BSD-based operating systems
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption
and device hang) by sending many Router Advertisement (RA) messages
with different source addresses, a similar vulnerability to
CVE-2010-4670.
