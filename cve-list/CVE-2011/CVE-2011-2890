The MediaViewMedia class in
administrator/components/com_media/views/media/view.html.php in
Joomla! 1.5.23 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via vectors involving the base variable, leading to
disclosure of the installation path, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2011-2488.
