The PlushSearch2 function in Search.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF)
before 1.1.13, and 2.x before 2.0 RC5, uses certain cached data in a
situation where a temporary table has been created, even though this
cached data is intended only for situations where a temporary table
has not been created, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via a search.
