The RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray method in metadata/icall.c in Mono,
when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, does not
properly restrict data types, which allows remote attackers to modify
internal read-only data structures, and cause a denial of service
(plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security manager,
via a crafted media file, as demonstrated by modifying a C# struct.
