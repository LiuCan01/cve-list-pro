Use-after-free vulnerability in the ReleaseInterface function in
MSHTML.DLL in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(application crash) via vectors related to the DOM implementation and
the BreakAASpecial and BreakCircularMemoryReferences functions, as
demonstrated by cross_fuzz, aka "MSHTML Memory Corruption
Vulnerability."
