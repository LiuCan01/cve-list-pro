Integer overflow in QuickLook, as used in Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.7
and MobileSafari in Apple iOS before 4.2.7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.2,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and application crash) via a Microsoft
Office document with a crafted size field in the
OfficeArtMetafileHeader, related to OfficeArtBlip, as demonstrated on
the iPhone by Charlie Miller and Dion Blazakis during a Pwn2Own
competition at CanSecWest 2011.
