SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.2.4100 sends incorrect Content-Type
headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to
have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict
involving frmCustomReport.aspx and certain other files.  NOTE: it is
possible that only clients, not the SmarterStats product, could be
affected by this issue.
