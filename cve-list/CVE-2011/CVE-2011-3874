Stack-based buffer overflow in libsysutils in Android 2.2.x through
2.2.2 and 2.3.x through 2.3.6 allows user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via an application that calls the
FrameworkListener::dispatchCommand method with the wrong number of
arguments, as demonstrated by zergRush to trigger a use-after-free
error.
