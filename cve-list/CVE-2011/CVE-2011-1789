The self-extracting installer in the vSphere Client Installer package
in VMware vCenter 4.0 before Update 3 and 4.1 before Update 1, VMware
ESXi 4.x before 4.1 Update 1, and VMware ESX 4.x before 4.1 Update 1
does not have a digital signature, which might make it easier for
remote attackers to spoof the software distribution via a Trojan horse
installer.
