Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
xt:Commerce 3.0.4 SP2.1 and possibly earlier allow remote attackers to
hijack the authentication of Admins for requests that (1) set a New
user to Admin via the cID parameter to a statusconfirm action in
admin/customers.php and (2) grant permissions to users via the cID
parameter to a save action in admin/accounting.php.
