The logging functionality in dhcpd in ISC DHCP before 4.2.3-P2, when
using Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and issuing IPv6 addresses, does not properly
handle the DHCPv6 lease structure, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash)
via crafted packets related to a lease-status update.
