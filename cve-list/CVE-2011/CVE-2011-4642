mappy.py in Splunk Web in Splunk 4.2.x before 4.2.5 does not properly
restrict use of the mappy command to access Python classes, which
allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary code
by leveraging the sys module in a request to the search application,
as demonstrated by a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack, aka
SPL-45172.
