Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2, 3.5.1, and 4 does not properly
validate the System.Net.Sockets trust level, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information or trigger arbitrary
outbound network traffic via (1) a crafted XAML browser application
(aka XBAP), (2) a crafted ASP.NET application, or (3) a crafted .NET
Framework application, aka "Socket Restriction Bypass Vulnerability."
