chef-server-api/app/controllers/clients.rb in Chef Server in Chef
before 0.9.20, and 0.10.x before 0.10.6, does not require
administrative privileges for creating admin clients, which allows
remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by
leveraging read permission for the validation key and executing a
knife client create command with the --admin option.
