The Vector Markup Language (VML) implementation in vgx.dll in
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 8 does not properly handle
objects in memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code by accessing an object that (1) was not properly initialized or
(2) is deleted, aka "VML Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
