chan_sip.c in the SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.6.x
before 1.6.2.18.1 and 1.8.x before 1.8.4.3 does not properly handle
'0' characters in SIP packets, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted packet.
