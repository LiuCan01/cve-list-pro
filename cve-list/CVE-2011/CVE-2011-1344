Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, as used in Apple Safari before
5.0.5; iOS before 4.3.2 for iPhone, iPod, and iPad; iOS before 4.2.7
for iPhone 4 (CDMA); and possibly other products allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by adding children to a WBR tag
and then removing the tag, related to text nodes, as demonstrated by
Chaouki Bekrar during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2011.
