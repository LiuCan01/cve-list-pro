The Bluetooth Stack 2.1 in Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 and SP2 and
Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not prevent access to objects in memory
that (1) were not properly initialized or (2) have been deleted, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted
Bluetooth packets, aka "Bluetooth Stack Vulnerability."
