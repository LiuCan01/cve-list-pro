The pciej_write function in hw/acpi_piix4.c in the PIIX4 Power
Management emulation in qemu-kvm does not check if a device is
hotpluggable before unplugging the PCI-ISA bridge, which allows
privileged guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted value to the
0xae08 (PCI_EJ_BASE) I/O port, which leads to a use-after-free related
to "active qemu timers."
