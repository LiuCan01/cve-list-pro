The cupshelpers scripts in system-config-printer in Ubuntu 11.04 and
11.10, as used by the automatic printer driver download service, uses
an "insecure connection" for queries to the OpenPrinting database,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack that modifies packages or
repositories.
