Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through
3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions
deserialize objects from untrusted sources, which allows remote
attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and execute
untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using
InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as
demonstrated using deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory
instance to execute arbitrary commands via the java.lang.Runtime
class.
