Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the (1) abc_new_macro and (2)
abc_new_umacro functions in src/load_abc.cpp in libmodplug before
0.8.8.3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ABC file.  NOTE: some
of these details are obtained from third party information.
