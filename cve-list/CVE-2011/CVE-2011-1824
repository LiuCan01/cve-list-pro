The VEGAOpBitmap::AddLine function in Opera before 10.61 does not
properly initialize memory during processing of the SIZE attribute of
a SELECT element, which allows remote attackers to trigger an invalid
memory write operation, and consequently cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, via a large
integer attribute value.
