Eucalyptus before 2.0.3 and Eucalyptus EE before 2.0.2, as used in
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and other products, do not properly
interpret signed elements in SOAP requests, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary commands by modifying
a request, related to an "XML Signature Element Wrapping" or a "SOAP
signature replay" issue.
