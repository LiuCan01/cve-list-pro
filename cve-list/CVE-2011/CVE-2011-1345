Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 does not properly handle
objects in memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code by accessing an object that (1) was not properly initialized or
(2) is deleted, as demonstrated by Stephen Fewer as the first of three
chained vulnerabilities during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest
2011, aka "Object Management Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
