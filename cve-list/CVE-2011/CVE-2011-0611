Adobe Flash Player before 10.2.154.27 on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and
Solaris and 10.2.156.12 and earlier on Android; Adobe AIR before
2.6.19140; and Authplay.dll (aka AuthPlayLib.bundle) in Adobe Reader
9.x before 9.4.4 and 10.x through 10.0.1 on Windows, Adobe Reader 9.x
before 9.4.4 and 10.x before 10.0.3 on Mac OS X, and Adobe Acrobat 9.x
before 9.4.4 and 10.x before 10.0.3 on Windows and Mac OS X allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (application crash) via crafted Flash content; as demonstrated
by a Microsoft Office document with an embedded .swf file that has a
size inconsistency in a "group of included constants," object type
confusion, ActionScript that adds custom functions to prototypes, and
Date objects; and as exploited in the wild in April 2011.
