Reference: URL:http://groups.google.com/group/djabberd/msg/e3b250f3c1877ede?dmode=source

DJabberd 0.84 and earlier does not properly detect recursion during
entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document
containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar issue
to CVE-2003-1564.
