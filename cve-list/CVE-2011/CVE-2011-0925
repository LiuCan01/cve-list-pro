The CSDWebInstallerCtrl ActiveX control in CSDWebInstaller.ocx in
Cisco Secure Desktop (CSD) allows remote attackers to download an
unintended Cisco program onto a client machine, and execute this
program, by identifying a Cisco program with a Cisco digital signature
and then renaming this program to inst.exe, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2010-0589 and CVE-2011-0926.
