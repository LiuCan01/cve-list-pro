Bugzilla 3.6.x before 3.6.6, 3.7.x, 4.0.x before 4.0.2, and 4.1.x
before 4.1.3 on Windows does not delete the temporary files associated
with uploaded attachments, which allows local users to obtain
sensitive information by reading these files.  NOTE: this issue exists
because of a regression in 3.6.
