WebKit, as used in Google Chrome before 10.0.648.204 and Apple Safari
before 5.0.6, does not properly handle node parentage, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DOM tree corruption),
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or possibly have
unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
