The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel
10.2.0_build1011110331.18 generates a password form field without
disabling the autocomplete feature, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging an unattended
workstation, as demonstrated by forms in admin/reseller/login-info/
and certain other files.
