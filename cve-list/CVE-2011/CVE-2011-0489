The server components in Objectivity/DB 10.0 do not require
authentication for administrative commands, which allows remote
attackers to modify data, obtain sensitive information, or cause a
denial of service by sending requests over TCP to (1) the Lock Server
or (2) the Advanced Multithreaded Server, as demonstrated by commands
that are ordinarily sent by the (a) ookillls and (b) oostopams
applications.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
