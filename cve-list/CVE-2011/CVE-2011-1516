Reference: MISC:http://www.coresecurity.com/content/apple-osx-sandbox-bypass

The kSBXProfileNoNetwork and kSBXProfileNoInternet sandbox profiles in
Apple Mac OS X 10.5.x through 10.7.x do not propagate restrictions to
all created processes, which allows remote attackers to access network
resources via a crafted application, as demonstrated by use of
osascript to send Apple events to the launchd daemon, a related issue
to CVE-2008-7303.
