** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
lanoba-social-plugin/index.php in the Lanoba Social plugin 1.0 for
WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the action parameter.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue,
stating "Lanoba's plug in does sanitize user input, and because that
input is never sent to the browser, an attacker has no way of
executing script or code on a user's behalf."
