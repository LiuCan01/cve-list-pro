Multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in the WP Symposium
plugin before 11.12.24 for WordPress allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable extension using
(1) uploadify/upload_admin_avatar.php or (2)
uploadify/upload_profile_avatar.php, then accessing it via a direct
request to the file in an unspecified directory inside the webroot.
