Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in VaM Shop 1.6,
1.6.1, and probably earlier versions allows remote attackers to hijack
the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change user
status via admin/customers.php or (2) change user permissions via
admin/accounting.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
