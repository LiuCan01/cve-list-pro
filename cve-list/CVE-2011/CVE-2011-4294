The error-message functionality in Moodle 1.9.x before 1.9.13, 2.0.x
before 2.0.4, and 2.1.x before 2.1.1 does not ensure that a
continuation link refers to an http or https URL for the local Moodle
instance, which might allow attackers to trick users into visiting
arbitrary web sites via unspecified vectors.
