The seunshare_mount function in sandbox/seunshare.c in seunshare in
certain Red Hat packages of policycoreutils 2.0.83 and earlier in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and earlier, and Fedora 14 and earlier,
mounts a new directory on top of /tmp without assigning root ownership
and the sticky bit to this new directory, which allows local users to
replace or delete arbitrary /tmp files, and consequently cause a
denial of service or possibly gain privileges, by running a setuid
application that relies on /tmp, as demonstrated by the ksu
application.
