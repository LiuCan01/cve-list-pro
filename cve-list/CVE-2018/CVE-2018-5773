Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/issues/285

An issue was discovered in markdown2 (aka python-markdown2) through
2.3.5. The safe_mode feature, which is supposed to sanitize user input
against XSS, is flawed and does not escape the input properly. With a
crafted payload, XSS can be triggered, as demonstrated by omitting the
final '>' character from an IMG tag.
