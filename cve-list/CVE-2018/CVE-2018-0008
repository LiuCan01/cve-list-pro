An unauthenticated root login may allow upon reboot when a commit
script is used. A commit script allows a device administrator to
execute certain instructions during commit, which is configured under
the [system scripts commit] stanza. Certain commit scripts that work
without a problem during normal commit may cause unexpected behavior
upon reboot which can leave the system in a state where root CLI login
is allowed without a password due to the system reverting to a "safe
mode" authentication state. Lastly, only logging in physically to the
console port as root, with no password, will work. Affected releases
