In Xen 4.10, new infrastructure was introduced as part of an overhaul
to how MSR emulation happens for guests. Unfortunately, one tracking
structure isn't freed when a vcpu is destroyed. This allows guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (host OS memory
consumption) by rebooting many times.
