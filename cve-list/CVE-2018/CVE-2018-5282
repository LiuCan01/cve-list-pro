** DISPUTED ** Kentico 9.0 through 11.0 has a stack-based buffer
overflow via the SqlName, SqlPswd, Database, UserName, or Password
field in a SilentInstall XML document. NOTE: the vendor disputes this
issue because neither a buffer overflow nor a crash can be reproduced;
also, reading XML documents is implemented exclusively with managed
code within the Microsoft .NET Framework.
