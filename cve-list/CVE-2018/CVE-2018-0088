A vulnerability in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands on Cisco
Industrial Ethernet 4010 Series Switches running Cisco IOS Software
could allow an authenticated, local attacker to impact the stability of
the device. This could result in arbitrary code execution or a denial
of service (DoS) condition. The attacker has to have valid user
credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to a
diagnostic test CLI command that allows the attacker to write to the
device memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a specific diagnostic
test command at the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to
overwrite system memory locations, which could have a negative impact
on the stability of the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf71150.
