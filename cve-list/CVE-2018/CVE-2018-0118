A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified
Communications Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the
web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based
management interface to click a link that is designed to submit
malicious input to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the
interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
information on the targeted device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg51264.
