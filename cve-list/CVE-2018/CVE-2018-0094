A vulnerability in IPv6 ingress packet processing for Cisco UCS Central
Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
denial of service (DoS) condition due to high CPU utilization on the
targeted device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate limiting
protection for IPv6 ingress traffic. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of IPv6
packets. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause a
DoS condition due to CPU and resource constraints. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCuv34544.
