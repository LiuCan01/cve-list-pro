A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before
0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign
tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability
is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key
(JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a
JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker
could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the
original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then
signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated
with the public key embedded in that JWS header.
