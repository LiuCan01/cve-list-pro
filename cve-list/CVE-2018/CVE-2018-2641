Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle
Java SE (subcomponent: AWT). Supported versions that are affected are
Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151.
Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java
SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a
person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java
SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional
products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical
data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in
servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by
an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.1 (Integrity impacts). CVSS
Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N).
