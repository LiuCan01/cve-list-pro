Reservo Image Hosting 1.6 is vulnerable to XSS attacks. The affected
function is its search engine (the t parameter to the /search URI).
Since there is an user/admin login interface, it's possible for
attackers to steal sessions of users and thus admin(s). By sending
users an infected URL, code will be executed.
