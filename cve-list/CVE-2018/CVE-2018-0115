A vulnerability in the CLI of the Cisco StarOS operating system for
Cisco ASR 5000 Series routers could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on an
affected host operating system. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious command arguments
into a vulnerable CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. To exploit
this vulnerability, the attacker would need to authenticate to the
affected system by using valid administrator credentials. Cisco Bug
