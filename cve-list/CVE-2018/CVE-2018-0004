A sustained sequence of different types of normal transit traffic can
trigger a high CPU consumption denial of service condition in the
Junos OS register and schedule software interrupt handler subsystem
when a specific command is issued to the device. This affects one or
more threads and conversely one or more running processes running on
the system. Once this occurs, the high CPU event(s) affects either or
both the forwarding and control plane. As a result of this condition
the device can become inaccessible in either or both the control and
forwarding plane and stops forwarding traffic until the device is
rebooted. The issue will reoccur after reboot upon receiving further
transit traffic. Score: 5.7 MEDIUM
(CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) For network designs
utilizing layer 3 forwarding agents or other ARP through layer 3
technologies, the score is slightly higher. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) If the following entry
exists in the RE message logs then this may indicate the issue is
present. This entry may or may not appear when this issue occurs.
