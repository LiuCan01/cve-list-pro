Reference: MISC:https://github.com/Snowty/myCVE/blob/master/CraftCMS-2.6.3000/README.md

Craft CMS 2.6.3000 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
code by using the "Assets->Upload files" screen and then the "Replace
it" option, because this allows a .jpg file to have embedded PHP code,
and then be renamed to a .php extension.
