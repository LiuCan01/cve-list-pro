A vulnerability in the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) of the
Cisco Policy Suite (CPS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to access sensitive data. The attacker could use this
information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The attacker
would also have to have access to the internal VLAN where CPS is
deployed. The vulnerability is due to incorrect permissions of certain
system files and not sufficiently protecting sensitive data that is at
rest. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using certain
tools available on the internal network interface to request and view
system files. An exploit could allow the attacker to find out sensitive
information about the application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf77666.
