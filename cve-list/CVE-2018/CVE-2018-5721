Stack-based buffer overflow in the ej_update_variables function in
router/httpd/web.c on ASUS routers (when using software from
https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin) allows web authenticated
attackers to execute code via a request that updates a setting. In
ej_update_variables, the length of the variable action_script is not
checked, as long as it includes a "_wan_if" substring.
