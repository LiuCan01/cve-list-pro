An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16.
There is a variable "dbentry->n_key_data" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that
can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a "u4"
variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this
vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that
a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.
