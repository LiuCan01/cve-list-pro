Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Oturia Smart Google Code
Inserter plugin before 3.5 for WordPress allows unauthenticated
attackers to insert arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code (via the
sgcgoogleanalytic parameter) that runs on all pages served by
WordPress. The saveGoogleCode() function in smartgooglecode.php does
not check if the current request is made by an authorized user, thus
allowing any unauthenticated user to successfully update the inserted
code.
