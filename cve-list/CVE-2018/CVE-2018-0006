A high rate of VLAN authentication attempts sent from an adjacent host
on the local broadcast domain can trigger high memory utilization by
the BBE subscriber management daemon (bbe-smgd), and lead to a denial
of service condition. The issue was caused by attempting to process an
unbounded number of pending VLAN authentication requests, leading to
excessive memory allocation. This issue only affects devices
configured for DHCPv4/v6 over AE auto-sensed VLANs, utilized in
Broadband Edge (BBE) deployments. Other configurations are unaffected
by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1
versions prior to 15.1R6-S2, 15.1R7; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R5-S1,
16.1R6; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S2, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior
to 17.1R2-S5, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2.
