A vulnerability in the Pong tool of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected
device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
vulnerability exists because the affected software attempts to free the
same area of memory twice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by sending a pong request to an affected device from a location on the
network that causes the pong reply packet to egress both a FabricPath
port and a non-FabricPath port. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause a dual or quad supervisor virtual port-channel (vPC) to reload.
This vulnerability affects the following products when running Cisco
NX-OS Software Release 7.2(1)D(1), 7.2(2)D1(1), or 7.2(2)D1(2) with
both the Pong and FabricPath features enabled and the FabricPath port
is actively monitored via a SPAN session: Cisco Nexus 7000 Series
Switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series Switches. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCuv98660.
