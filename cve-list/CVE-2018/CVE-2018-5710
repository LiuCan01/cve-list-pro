Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/poojamnit/Kerberos-V5-1.16-Vulnerabilities/tree/master/Denial%20Of%20Service(DoS)

An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. The
pre-defined function "strlen" is getting a "NULL" string as a parameter
value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key
Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified
kadmin client.
