A vulnerability in the network-operator user role implementation for
Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to improperly delete valid user accounts. The network-operator
role should not be able to delete other configured users on the device.
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper role-based access control
(RBAC) checks for the actions that a user with the network-operator
role is allowed to perform. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by authenticating to the device with user credentials
that give that user the network-operator role. Successful exploitation
could allow the attacker to impact the integrity of the device by
deleting configured user credentials. The attacker would need valid
user credentials for the device. This vulnerability affects the
following Cisco products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Nexus
3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 9000 Series
Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and
Fabric Modules. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg21120.
