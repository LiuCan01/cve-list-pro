Phase: Assigned (20180122)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-b3bf.html

libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data
to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP
requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in
the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP
response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the
`Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers to
subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass
on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains
privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to
impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.
