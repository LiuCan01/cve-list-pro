libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in
code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported
(https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2
trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one
byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates
HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a
string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed
to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math
wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of
bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets
passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service
situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that
echoes back or uses the trailers for something.
