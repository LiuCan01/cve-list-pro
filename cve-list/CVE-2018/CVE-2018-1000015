On Jenkins instances with Authorize Project plugin, the authentication
associated with a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some
agents. This did not prevent the execution of Pipeline `node` blocks
on those agents due to incorrect permissions checks in Pipeline: Nodes
and Processes plugin 2.17 and earlier.
