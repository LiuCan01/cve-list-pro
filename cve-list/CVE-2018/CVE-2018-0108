A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to collect customer files via an
out-of-band XML External Entity (XXE) injection. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional
reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to the ability of an
attacker to perform an out-of-band XXE injection on the system, which
could allow an attacker to capture customer files and redirect them to
another destination address. An exploit could allow the attacker to
discover sensitive customer data. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg36996.
