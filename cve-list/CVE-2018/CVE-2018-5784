In LibTIFF 4.0.9, there is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the
TIFFSetDirectory function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could leverage
this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tif file.
This occurs because the declared number of directory entries is not
validated against the actual number of directory entries.
