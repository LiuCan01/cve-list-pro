A vulnerability in the administrative shell of Cisco AsyncOS on Cisco
Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Content Security Management
Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to
escalate their privilege level and gain root access. The attacker has
to have a valid user credential with at least a privilege level of a
guest user. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect networking
configuration at the administrative shell CLI. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and
issuing a set of crafted, malicious commands at the administrative
shell. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access on the
device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb34303, CSCvb35726.
