Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE
(subcomponent: JavaFX). Supported versions that are affected are Java
SE: 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows
unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from
a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in
Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: This
vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in
servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by
an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.7 (Confidentiality impacts).
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).
