An issue was discovered in AsusWRT before 3.0.0.4.384_10007. The
do_vpnupload_post function in router/httpd/web.c in vpnupload.cgi
provides functionality for setting NVRAM configuration values, which
allows attackers to set the admin password and launch an SSH daemon (or
enable infosvr command mode), and consequently obtain remote
administrative access, via a crafted request. This is available to
unauthenticated attackers in conjunction with CVE-2018-5999.
