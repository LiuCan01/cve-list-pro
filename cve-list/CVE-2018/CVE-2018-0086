A vulnerability in the application server of the Cisco Unified Customer
Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The
vulnerability is due to malformed SIP INVITE traffic received on the
CVP during communications with the Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser
(VVB). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
malformed SIP INVITE traffic to the targeted appliance. An exploit
could allow the attacker to impact the availability of services and
data on the device, causing a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects
Cisco Unified CVP running any software release prior to 11.6(1). Cisco
