A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality
of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to perform a privilege escalation in which one virtual domain
user can view and modify another virtual domain configuration. The
vulnerability is due to a failure to properly enforce RBAC for virtual
domains. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an
authenticated, crafted HTTP request to a targeted application. An
exploit could allow the attacker to bypass RBAC policies on the
targeted system to modify a virtual domain and access resources that
are not normally accessible. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg36875.
