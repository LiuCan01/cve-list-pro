FoxSash ImgHosting 1.5 (according to footer information) is vulnerable
to XSS attacks. The affected function is its search engine via the
search parameter to the default URI. Since there is an user/admin login
interface, it's possible for attackers to steal sessions of users and
thus admin(s). By sending users an infected URL, code will be executed.
