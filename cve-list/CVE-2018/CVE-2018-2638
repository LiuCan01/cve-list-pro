(subcomponent: Deployment). Supported versions that are affected are
Java SE: 8u152 and 9.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows
unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from
a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in
Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of

typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code
installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3
(Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
