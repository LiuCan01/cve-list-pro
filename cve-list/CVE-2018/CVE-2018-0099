A vulnerability in the web management GUI of the Cisco D9800 Network
Transport Receiver could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient input validation of GUI command arguments. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted arguments into a
vulnerable GUI command. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute
commands on the underlying BusyBox operating system. These commands are
run at the privilege level of the authenticated user. The attacker
needs valid device credentials for this attack. Cisco Bug IDs:
