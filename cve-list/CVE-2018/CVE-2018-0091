A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity
Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to conduct a Document Object Model (DOM) cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the
interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf73922.
