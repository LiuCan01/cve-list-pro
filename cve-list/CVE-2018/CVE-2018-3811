SQL Injection vulnerability in the Oturia Smart Google Code Inserter
plugin before 3.5 for WordPress allows unauthenticated attackers to
execute SQL queries in the context of the web server. The
saveGoogleAdWords() function in smartgooglecode.php did not use
prepared statements and did not sanitize the $_POST["oId"] variable
before passing it as input into the SQL query.
