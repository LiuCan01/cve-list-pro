A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco WAP150
Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Access Point with Power over Ethernet (PoE)
and WAP361 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Wall Plate Access Point with PoE
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management
interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a
crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the
attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs:
CSCve57076.
