Cisco UCS Invicta 4.3, 4.5, and 5.0.1 on Invicta appliances and
Invicta Scaling System uses the same hardcoded GnuPG encryption key
across different customers' installations, which allows remote
attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by sniffing
network traffic to an Autosupport server and leveraging knowledge of
this key from another installation, aka Bug ID CSCur85504.
