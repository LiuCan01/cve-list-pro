The overflow protection in Expat is removed by compilers with certain
optimization settings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted XML
data.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2015-1283 and CVE-2015-2716.
