An issue was discovered in BigTree CMS before 4.2.15. The vulnerability
exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the "id"
HTTP GET parameter passed to the
"core/admin/adjax/dashboard/check-module-integrity.php" URL. An
attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in
the context of the vulnerable website.
