wiretap/nettrace_3gpp_32_423.c in the 3GPP TS 32.423 Trace file parser
in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not ensure that a '0' character
is present at the end of certain strings, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow
and application crash) via a crafted file.
