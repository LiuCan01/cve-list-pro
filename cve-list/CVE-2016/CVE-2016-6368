A vulnerability in the detection engine parsing of Pragmatic General
Multicast (PGM) protocol packets for Cisco Firepower System Software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
service (DoS) condition due to the Snort process unexpectedly
restarting. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of
the fields in the PGM protocol packet. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted PGM packet to the detection engine
on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a
DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is
bypassed or traffic is dropped. This vulnerability affects Cisco
Firepower System Software that has one or more file action policies
configured and is running on any of the following Cisco products:
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER
Services; Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series
