When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space
for a block of data within the file. When calculating this length, the
application will use a value from the file and add a constant to it
without checking whether the addition of the constant will cause the
integer to overflow which will cause the buffer to be undersized when
the application tries to copy file data into it. This allows one to
overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution
under the context of the application.
