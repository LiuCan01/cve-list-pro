ISC BIND through 9.9.9-P1, 9.10.x through 9.10.4-P1, and 9.11.x
through 9.11.0b1 allows primary DNS servers to cause a denial of
service (secondary DNS server crash) via a large AXFR response, and
possibly allows IXFR servers to cause a denial of service (IXFR client
crash) via a large IXFR response and allows remote authenticated users
to cause a denial of service (primary DNS server crash) via a large
UPDATE message.
