hitek.jar in Hitek Software's Automize uses weak encryption when
encrypting SSH/SFTP and Encryption profile passwords. This allows an
attacker to retrieve the encrypted passwords from sshProfiles.jsd and
encryptionProfiles.jsd and decrypt them to recover cleartext passwords.
All 10.x up to and including 10.25 and all 11.x up to and including
11.14 are verified to be affected.
