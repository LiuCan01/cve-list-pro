Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite
component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and
12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via unknown
vectors related to Load Testing for Web Apps, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2016-0476 and CVE-2016-0478.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in
the DownloadServlet servlet, which allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the (1)
repository, (2) workspace, or (3) scenario parameter.
