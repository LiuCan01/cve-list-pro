The Apache OpenOffice installer (versions prior to 4.1.3, including
some branded as OpenOffice.org) for Windows contains a defective
operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated
privileges. This requires that the location in which the installer is
run has been previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a
dynamic-link library that the installer depends upon.
