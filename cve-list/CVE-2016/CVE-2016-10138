An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices with
Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as
a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the
com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the
android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which
makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on
the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named
com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device
can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an
intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component
which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing
the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a
phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen,
record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events,
obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the
com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a
URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands
in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by
the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is
made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack.
