An XSS vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
client side script on vulnerable installations of Sophos Cyberoam
firewall devices with firmware through 10.6.4. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists
within the handling of a request to the "LiveConnectionDetail.jsp"
application. GET parameters "applicationname" and "username" are
improperly sanitized allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary
JavaScript into the page. This can be abused by an attacker to perform
a cross-site scripting attack on the user. A vulnerable URI is
/corporate/webpages/trafficdiscovery/LiveConnectionDetail.jsp.
