Multiple integer overflows in libXpm before 3.5.12, when a program
requests parsing XPM extensions on a 64-bit platform, allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or
execute arbitrary code via (1) the number of extensions or (2) their
concatenated length in a crafted XPM file, which triggers a heap-based
buffer overflow.
