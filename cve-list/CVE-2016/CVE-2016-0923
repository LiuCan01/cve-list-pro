The client in EMC RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite (MES) 4.0.x before
4.0.9 and 4.1.x before 4.1.5 places the weakest algorithms first in a
signature-algorithm list transmitted to a server, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection
mechanisms by leveraging server behavior in which the first algorithm
is used.
