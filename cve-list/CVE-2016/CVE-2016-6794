When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to
read system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager. In
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.4, 8.0.0.RC1 to
8.0.36, 7.0.0 to 7.0.70, 6.0.0 to 6.0.45 the system property
replacement feature for configuration files could be used by a
malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read
system properties that should not be visible.
