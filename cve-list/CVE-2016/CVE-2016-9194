A vulnerability in 802.11 Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME) action
frame processing in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could
allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input
validation of the 802.11 WME packet header. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending malformed 802.11 WME frames to a targeted
device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the WLC
to reload unexpectedly. The fixed versions are 8.0.140.0, 8.2.130.0,
and 8.3.111.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva86353.
