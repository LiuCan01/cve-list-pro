A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK
library between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of
service attack, specifically a so-called "HPACK Bomb" attack. This
attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly
the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header
table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply
repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can
lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that
16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.
