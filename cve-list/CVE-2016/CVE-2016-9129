Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Information Exposure Through
Discrepancy. It is possible to check whether or not an email address
was associated to one or more user accounts on a target Revive Adserver
instance by examining the message printed by the password recovery
system. Such information cannot however be used directly to log in to
the system, which requires a username.
