Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Configurator component in
Oracle Supply Chain Products Suite 12.0.6, 12.1, and 12.2 allows
remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via vectors
related to JRAD Heartbeat. NOTE: the previous information is from the
April 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that
that this issue involves multiple cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities, which allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via three unspecified parameters in an unknown JSP
file.
