Multiple information leaks exist in various IOCTL handlers of the
Kaspersky Internet Security KLDISK driver. Specially crafted IOCTL
requests can cause the driver to return out-of-bounds kernel memory,
potentially leaking sensitive information such as privileged tokens or
kernel memory addresses that may be useful in bypassing kernel
mitigations. An unprivileged user can run a program from user-mode to
trigger this vulnerability.
