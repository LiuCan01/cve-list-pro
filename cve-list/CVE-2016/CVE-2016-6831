Reference: MLIST:[chicken-announce] 20160812 [SECURITY] Buffer overrun in process-execute and process-spawn

The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures did not free
memory correctly when the execve() call failed, resulting in a memory
leak. This could be abused by an attacker to cause resource exhaustion
or a denial of service. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and
including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet
released).
