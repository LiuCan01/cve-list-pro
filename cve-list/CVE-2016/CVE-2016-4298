When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space
for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating
this length, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause
the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file
data into the object containing this structure. This allows one to
overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution
under the context of the application.
