All versions of NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contain a
vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for
DxgDdiEscape where a value passed from a user to the driver is used
without validation as the size input to memcpy(), causing a buffer
overflow, leading to denial of service or potential escalation of
privileges.
