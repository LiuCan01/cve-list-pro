EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2 has a PKCS#12 Timing
Attack Vulnerability. A possible timing attack could be carried out by
modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which the
password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12
file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This
is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare
the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability is similar
to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601.
