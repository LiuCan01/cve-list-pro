Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and
9.1.2 suffer from Reflected XSS in the Gallery application. The
gallery app was not properly sanitizing exception messages from the
Nextcloud/ownCloud server. Due to an endpoint where an attacker could
influence the error message, this led to a reflected
Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability.
