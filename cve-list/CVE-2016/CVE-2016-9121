go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an invalid curve attack for the
ECDH-ES algorithm. When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an
encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check that the received public
key on a message is on the same curve as the static private key of the
receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.
