The sendRequest method in HTTPClient Class in file /inc/HTTPClient.php
in DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older, when media file fetching is enabled,
has no way to restrict access to private networks. This allows users to
scan ports of internal networks via SSRF, such as 10.0.0.1/8,
172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.
