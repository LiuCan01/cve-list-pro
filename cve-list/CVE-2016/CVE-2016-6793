The DiskFileItem class in Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0 and 1.5.x
before 1.5.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop) and write to, move, and delete files with the
permissions of DiskFileItem, and if running on a Java VM before 1.3.1,
execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized Java object.
