An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange Server 6 / OX AppSuite before
7.8.0-rev26. The "session" parameter for file-download requests can be
used to inject script code that gets reflected through the subsequent
status page. Malicious script code can be executed within a trusted
domain's context. While no OX App Suite specific data can be
manipulated, the vulnerability can be exploited without being
authenticated and therefore used for social engineering attacks,
stealing cookies or redirecting from trustworthy to malicious hosts.
