A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority
library prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer
by having that peer assign priority information for every possible
HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store
the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate
unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like
this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.
