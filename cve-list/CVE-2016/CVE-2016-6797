The ResourceLinkFactory implementation in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to
9.0.0.M9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.4, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36, 7.0.0 to 7.0.70 and
6.0.0 to 6.0.45 did not limit web application access to global JNDI
resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web application.
Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access any global
JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been configured or
not.
