An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before
7.8.1-rev11. The API to configure external mail accounts can be abused
to map and access network components within the trust boundary of the
operator. Users can inject arbitrary hosts and ports to API calls.
Depending on the response type, content and latency, information about
existence of hosts and services can be gathered. Attackers can get
internal configuration information about the infrastructure of an
operator to prepare subsequent attacks.
