** DISPUTED ** Open Dental 16.1 and earlier has a hardcoded MySQL root
password, which allows remote attackers to obtain administrative
access by leveraging access to intranet TCP port 3306.  NOTE: the
vendor disputes this issue, stating that the "vulnerability note ...
is factually false ... there is indeed a default blank password, but
it can be changed ... We recommend that users change it, each customer
receives direction."
