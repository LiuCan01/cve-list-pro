An exploitable incorrect return value vulnerability exists in the
mp_check function of Tarantool's Msgpuck library 1.0.3. A specially
crafted packet can cause the mp_check function to incorrectly return
success when trying to check if decoding a map16 packet will read
outside the bounds of a buffer, resulting in a denial of service
vulnerability.
