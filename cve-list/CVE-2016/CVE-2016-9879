An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before 3.2.10, 4.1.x
before 4.1.4, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. Spring Security does not consider
URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a
URL path parameter with an encoded "/" to a request, an attacker may be
able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a
lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the
Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters
in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring
Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the
process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected
presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed.
Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this
vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by
the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value
returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo().
Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not
be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters
has been modified. Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are
known to be affected. Users of other containers that implement the
Servlet specification may be affected.
