Reference: MISC:https://rt-solutions.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CVE-2016-1518-insecure-provisioning.pdf

The auto-provisioning mechanism in the Grandstream Wave app 1.0.1.26
and earlier for Android and Grandstream Video IP phones allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof provisioning data and
consequently modify device functionality, obtain sensitive information
from system logs, and have unspecified other impact by leveraging
failure to use an HTTPS session for downloading configuration files
from http://fm.grandstream.com/gs/.
