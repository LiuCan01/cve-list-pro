sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user
password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the
username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate
users by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a
large password is provided.
