The _prolog_error function in slurmd/req.c in Slurm before 15.08.13,
16.x before 16.05.7, and 17.x before 17.02.0-pre4 has a vulnerability
in how the slurmd daemon informs users of a Prolog failure on a compute
node. That vulnerability could allow a user to assume control of an
arbitrary file on the system. Any exploitation of this is dependent on
the user being able to cause or anticipate the failure (non-zero return
code) of a Prolog script that their job would run on. This issue
affects all Slurm versions from 0.6.0 (September 2005) to present.
Workarounds to prevent exploitation of this are to either disable your
Prolog script, or modify it such that it always returns 0 ("success")
and adjust it to set the node as down using scontrol instead of relying
on the slurmd to handle that automatically. If you do not have a Prolog
set you are unaffected by this issue.
