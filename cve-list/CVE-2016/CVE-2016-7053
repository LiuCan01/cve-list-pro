In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, applications parsing invalid CMS
structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused
by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0
which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure
callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only
CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are
affected.
