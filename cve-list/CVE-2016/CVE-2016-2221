Open redirect vulnerability in the wp_validate_redirect function in
wp-includes/pluggable.php in WordPress before 4.4.2 allows remote
attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct
phishing attacks via a malformed URL that triggers incorrect hostname
parsing, as demonstrated by an https:example.com URL.
