Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
before 0.9.11 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
payload decompressed length exceeds what is specified by the tile
dimensions.
