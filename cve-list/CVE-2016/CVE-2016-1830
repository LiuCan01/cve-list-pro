The kernel in Apple iOS before 9.3.2, OS X before 10.11.5, tvOS before
9.2.1, and watchOS before 2.2.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary
code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) via a crafted app, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2016-1827, CVE-2016-1828, and CVE-2016-1829.
