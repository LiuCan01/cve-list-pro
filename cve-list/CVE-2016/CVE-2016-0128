The SAM and LSAD protocol implementations in Microsoft Windows Vista
SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1,
Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, and Windows 10 Gold
and 1511 do not properly establish an RPC channel, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to perform protocol-downgrade attacks and
impersonate users by modifying the client-server data stream, aka
"Windows SAM and LSAD Downgrade Vulnerability" or "BADLOCK."
