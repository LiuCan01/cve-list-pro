In F5 BIG-IP systems 12.1.0 - 12.1.2, malicious requests made to
virtual servers with an HTTP profile can cause the TMM to restart. The
issue is exposed with BIG-IP APM profiles, regardless of settings. The
issue is also exposed with the non-default "Normalize URI"
configuration options used in iRules and/or BIG-IP LTM policies. An
attacker may be able to disrupt traffic or cause the BIG-IP system to
fail over to another device in the device group.
