A directory traversal exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in
Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent from the server could
potentially result in an overwrite of files. A malicious server or
someone with access to the network traffic can provide an invalid
filename for a splash image triggering the vulnerability.
