Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite
component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and
12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and
integrity via unknown vectors related to Load Testing for Web Apps, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0488.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in
the isAllowedUrl function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication via directory traversal sequences following a URI entry
that does not require authentication, as demonstrated by
olt/Login.do/../../olt/UploadFileUpload.do.
