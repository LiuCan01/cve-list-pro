An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin involving the %u username
replacement functionality of the SaveDir and UploadDir features. When
the username substitution is configured, a specially-crafted user name
can be used to circumvent restrictions to traverse the file system.
All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to
4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
