The Realm implementations in Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to
9.0.0.M9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.4, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36, 7.0.0 to 7.0.70 and
6.0.0 to 6.0.45 did not process the supplied password if the supplied
user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to
determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration
includes the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this
vulnerability harder.
