The SMB service in EMC VNXe (VNXe3200 Operating Environment prior to
3.1.5.8711957 and VNXe3100/3150/3300 Operating Environment prior to
2.4.4.22638), VNX1 File OE before 7.1.80.3, VNX2 File OE before
8.1.9.155, and Celerra (all supported versions) does not prevent
duplicate NTLM challenge-response nonces, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, or read or write to files,
via a series of authentication requests, a related issue to
CVE-2010-0231.
