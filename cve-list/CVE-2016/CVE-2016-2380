An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in
Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent to the server could
potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A user could be convinced
to enter a particular string which would then get converted
incorrectly and could lead to a potential out-of-bounds read.
