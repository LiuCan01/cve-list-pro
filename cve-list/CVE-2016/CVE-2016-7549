Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.113 does not ensure that the recipient
of a certain IPC message is a valid RenderFrame or RenderWidget, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer
dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact by leveraging access to a renderer process, related to
render_frame_host_impl.cc and render_widget_host_impl.cc, as
demonstrated by a Password Manager message.
