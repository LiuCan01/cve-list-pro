The framework APIs in Android 4.x before 4.4.4, 5.0.x before 5.0.2,
5.1.x before 5.1.1, and 6.x before 2016-08-01 do not ensure that
package data originated from the Package Manager, which allows
attackers to bypass an unspecified protection mechanism via a crafted
application, aka internal bug 28795098.
