Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle
Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are
affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111.
Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE
Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person
other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can
result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to
all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in
servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by
an administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality impacts).
