An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. A malicious Apport
crash file can contain a restart command in `RespawnCommand` or
`ProcCmdline` fields. This command will be executed if a user clicks
the Relaunch button on the Apport prompt from the malicious crash file.
The fix is to only show the Relaunch button on Apport crash files
generated by local systems. The Relaunch button will be hidden when
crash files are opened directly in Apport-GTK.
