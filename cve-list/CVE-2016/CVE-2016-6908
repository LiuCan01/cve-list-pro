Characters from languages are such as Arabic, Hebrew are displayed
from RTL (Right To Left) order in Opera 37.0.2192.105088 for Android,
due to mishandling of several unicode characters such as U+FE70,
U+0622, U+0623 etc and how they are rendered combined with (first
strong character) such as an IP address or alphabet could lead to a
spoofed URL. It was noticed that by placing neutral characters such as
"/", "?" in filepath causes the URL to be flipped and displayed from
Right To Left. However, in order for the URL to be spoofed the URL
must begin with an IP address followed by neutral characters as
omnibox considers IP address to be combination of punctuation and
numbers and since LTR (Left To Right) direction is not properly
enforced, this causes the entire URL to be treated and rendered from
RTL (Right To Left). However, it doesn't have be an IP address, what
matters is that first strong character (generally, alphabetic
character) in the URL must be an RTL character.
