Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox component in
Oracle Virtualization VirtualBox before 5.0.14 allows local users to
affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown
vectors related to Windows Installer.  NOTE: the previous information
is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party
claims that this is an untrusted search path issue that allows local
users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse dll in the "application
directory."
