In F5 BIG-IP 12.1.0 through 12.1.2, permissions enforced by iControl
can lag behind the actual permissions assigned to a user if the
role_map is not reloaded between the time the permissions are changed
and the time of the user's next request. This is a race condition that
occurs rarely in normal usage; the typical period in which this is
possible is limited to at most a few seconds after the permission
change.
