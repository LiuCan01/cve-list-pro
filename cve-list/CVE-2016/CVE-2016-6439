A vulnerability in the detection engine reassembly of HTTP packets for
Cisco Firepower System Software before 6.0.1 could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition due to the Snort process unexpectedly restarting. The
vulnerability is due to improper handling of an HTTP packet stream. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP
packet stream to the detection engine on the targeted device. An
exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort
process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is
dropped.
