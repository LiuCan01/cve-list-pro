IBM Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 3 Interim Fix 2 through 9.0.1 Fix Pack 5
Interim Fix 1, when using TLS and AES GCM, uses random nonce
generation, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the
authentication key and spoof data by leveraging the reuse of a nonce
in a session and a "forbidden attack." NOTE: this CVE has been
incorrectly used for GCM nonce reuse issues in other products; see
CVE-2016-10213 for the A10 issue, CVE-2016-10212 for the Radware
issue, and CVE-2017-5933 for the Citrix issue.
