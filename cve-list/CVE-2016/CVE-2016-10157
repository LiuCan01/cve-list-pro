Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95995

Akamai NetSession 1.9.3.1 is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking: it tries to
load CSUNSAPI.dll without supplying the complete path. The issue is
aggravated because the mentioned DLL is missing from the installation,
thus making it possible to hijack the DLL and subsequently inject code
within the Akamai NetSession process space.
