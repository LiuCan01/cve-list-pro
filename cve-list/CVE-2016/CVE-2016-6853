An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.2-rev5.
Script code and references to external websites can be injected to the
names of PGP public keys. When requesting that key later on using a
specific URL, such script code might get executed. In case of injecting
external websites, users might get lured into a phishing scheme.
Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can
lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web
interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).
