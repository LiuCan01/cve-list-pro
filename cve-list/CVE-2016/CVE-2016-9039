An exploitable denial of service exists in the Joyent SmartOS
20161110T013148Z Hyprlofs file system.  The vulnerability is present
in the Ioctl system call with the command HYPRLOFS_ADD_ENTRIES.  An
attacker can cause a buffer to be allocated and never freed.  When
repeatedly exploited this will result in memory exhaustion, resulting
in a full system denial of service.
