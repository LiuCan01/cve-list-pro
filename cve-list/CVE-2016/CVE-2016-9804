In BlueZ 5.42, a buffer overflow was observed in "commands_dump"
function in "tools/parser/csr.c" source file. The issue exists because
"commands" array is overflowed by supplied parameter due to lack of
boundary checks on size of the buffer from frame "frm->ptr" parameter.
This issue can be triggered by processing a corrupted dump file and
will result in hcidump crash.
