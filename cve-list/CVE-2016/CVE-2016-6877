** DISPUTED ** Citrix XenMobile Server before 10.5.0.24 allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger HTTP 302 redirections via
vectors involving the HTTP Host header and a cached page.  NOTE: the
vendor reports "our internal analysis of this issue concluded that
this was not a valid vulnerability" because an exploitation scenario
would involve a man-in-the-middle attack against a TLS session.
