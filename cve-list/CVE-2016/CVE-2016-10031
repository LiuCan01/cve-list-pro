** DISPUTED ** WampServer 3.0.6 installs two services called
'wampapache' and 'wampmysqld' with weak file permissions, running with
SYSTEM privileges. This could potentially allow an authorized but
non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges on the system. To properly exploit this vulnerability, the
local attacker must insert an executable file called mysqld.exe or
httpd.exe and replace the original files. The next time the service
starts, the malicious file will get executed as SYSTEM. NOTE: the
vendor disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that
a configuration in which "'someone' (an attacker) is able to replace
files on a PC" is not "the fault of WampServer."
