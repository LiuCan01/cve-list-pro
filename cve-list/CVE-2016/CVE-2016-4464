The application plugins in Apache CXF Fediz 1.2.x before 1.2.3 and
1.3.x before 1.3.1 do not match SAML AudienceRestriction values
against configured audience URIs, which might allow remote attackers
to have bypass intended restrictions and have unspecified other impact
via a crafted SAML token with a trusted signature.
