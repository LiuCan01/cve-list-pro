An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in
Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could
potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A malicious user, server,
or man-in-the-middle can send an invalid size for an avatar which will
trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a
denial of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in
an information leak if the avatar is sent to another user.
