An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before
7.8.1-rev14. Adding images from external sources to HTML editors by
drag&drop can potentially lead to script code execution in the context
of the active user. To exploit this, a user needs to be tricked to use
an image from a specially crafted website and add it to HTML editor
areas of OX App Suite, for example E-Mail Compose or OX Text. This
specific attack circumvents typical XSS filters and detection
mechanisms since the code is not loaded from an external service but
injected locally. Malicious script code can be executed within a
user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering
unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data
etc.). To exploit this vulnerability, a attacker needs to convince a
user to follow specific steps (social-engineering).
