** DISPUTED ** The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevention of
cluster joins) via a long sequence of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the
vendor disputes this issue, stating that this sequence is not
"removing the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the
manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs
out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker
Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually
the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply
join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a
manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate
nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and
definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability."
