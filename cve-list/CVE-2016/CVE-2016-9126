Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from persistent XSS. Usernames are
not properly escaped when displayed in the audit trail widget of the
dashboard upon login, allowing persistent XSS attacks. An authenticated
user with enough privileges to create other users could exploit the
vulnerability to access the administrator account.
