Open redirect vulnerability in the Console in Puppet Enterprise 2015.x
and 2016.x before 2016.4.0 allows remote attackers to redirect users
to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a // (slash
slash) followed by a domain in the redirect parameter.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-6501.
