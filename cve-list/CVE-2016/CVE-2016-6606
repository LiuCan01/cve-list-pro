An issue was discovered in cookie encryption in phpMyAdmin. The
decryption of the username/password is vulnerable to a padding oracle
attack. This can allow an attacker who has access to a user's browser
cookie file to decrypt the username and password. Furthermore, the
same initialization vector (IV) is used to hash the username and
password stored in the phpMyAdmin cookie. If a user has the same
password as their username, an attacker who examines the browser
cookie can see that they are the same - but the attacker can not
directly decode these values from the cookie as it is still hashed.
All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to
4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
