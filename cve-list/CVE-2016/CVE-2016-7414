The ZIP signature-verification feature in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x
before 7.0.11 does not ensure that the uncompressed_filesize field is
large enough, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds memory access) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted PHAR archive, related to ext/phar/util.c
and ext/phar/zip.c.
