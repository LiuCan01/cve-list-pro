Phase: Assigned (20151216)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-0780

It was discovered that cf-release v231 and lower, Pivotal Cloud
Foundry Elastic Runtime 1.5.x versions prior to 1.5.17 and Pivotal
Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime 1.6.x versions prior to 1.6.18 do not
properly enforce disk quotas in certain cases. An attacker could use
an improper disk quota value to bypass enforcement and consume all the
disk on DEAs/CELLs causing a potential denial of service for other
applications.
