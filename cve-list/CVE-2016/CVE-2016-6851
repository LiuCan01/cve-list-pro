An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.2-rev5.
Script code can be provided as parameter to the OX Guard guest reader
web application. This allows cross-site scripting attacks against
arbitrary users since no prior authentication is needed. Malicious
script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to
session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface
(sending mail, deleting data etc.) in case the user has an active
session on the same domain already.
