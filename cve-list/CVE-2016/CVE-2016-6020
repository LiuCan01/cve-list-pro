IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition could allow a remote
attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack.
By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote
attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed
to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be
trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive
information or conduct further attacks against the victim.
