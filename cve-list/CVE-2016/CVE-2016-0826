libcameraservice in mediaserver in Android 4.x before 4.4.4, 5.x
before 5.1.1 LMY49H, and 6.x before 2016-03-01 does not require use of
the ICameraService::dump method for a camera service dump, which
allows attackers to gain privileges via a crafted application that
directly dumps, as demonstrated by obtaining Signature or
SignatureOrSystem access, aka internal bug 26265403.
