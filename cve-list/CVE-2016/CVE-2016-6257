The firmware in Lenovo Ultraslim dongles, as used with Lenovo Liteon
SK-8861, Ultraslim Wireless, and Silver Silk keyboards and Liteon
ZTM600 and Ultraslim Wireless mice, does not enforce incrementing AES
counters, which allows remote attackers to inject encrypted keyboard
input into the system by leveraging proximity to the dongle, aka a
"KeyJack injection attack."
