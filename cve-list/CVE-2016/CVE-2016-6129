Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1370955
Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt/commit/5eb9743410ce4657e9d54fef26a2ee31a1b5dd0
Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.op-tee.org/advisories/

The rsa_verify_hash_ex function in rsa_verify_hash.c in LibTomCrypt,
as used in OP-TEE before 2.2.0, does not validate that the message
length is equal to the ASN.1 encoded data length, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to forge RSA signatures or public
certificates by leveraging a Bleichenbacher signature forgery attack.
