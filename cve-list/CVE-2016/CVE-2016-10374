perltidy through 20160302, as used by perlcritic, check-all-the-things,
and other software, relies on the current working directory for certain
output files and does not have a symlink-attack protection mechanism,
which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files by creating a
symlink, as demonstrated by creating a perltidy.ERR symlink that the
victim cannot delete.
