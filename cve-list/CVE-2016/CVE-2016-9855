An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. By calling some scripts that
are part of phpMyAdmin in an unexpected way, it is possible to trigger
phpMyAdmin to display a PHP error message which contains the full path
of the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed. During an execution
timeout in the export functionality, the errors containing the full
path of the directory of phpMyAdmin are written to the export file.
All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), and 4.4.x versions (prior to
4.4.15.9) are affected. This CVE is for the PMA_shutdownDuringExport
issue.
