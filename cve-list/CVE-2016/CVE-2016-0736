In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was
encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly
either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no
selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it
vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.
