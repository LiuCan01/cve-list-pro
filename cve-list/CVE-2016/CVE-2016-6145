The SQL interface in SAP HANA DB 1.00.091.00.1418659308 provides
different error messages for failed login attempts depending on
whether the username exists and is locked when the
detailed_error_on_connect option is not supported or is configured as
"False," which allows remote attackers to enumerate database users via
a series of login attempts, aka SAP Security Note 2216869.
