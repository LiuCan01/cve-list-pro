** DISPUTED ** WampServer 3.0.6 has two files called 'wampmanager.exe'
and 'unins000.exe' with a weak ACL for Modify. This could potentially
allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges on the system. To properly exploit this
vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file called
wampmanager.exe or unins000.exe and replace the original files. The
next time one of these programs is launched by a more privileged user,
malicious code chosen by the local attacker will run. NOTE: the vendor
disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that a
configuration in which "'someone' (an attacker) is able to replace
files on a PC" is not "the fault of WampServer."
