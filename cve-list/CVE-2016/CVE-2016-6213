fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9 does not restrict how
many mounts may exist in a mount namespace, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and deadlock) via
MS_BIND mount system calls, as demonstrated by a loop that triggers
exponential growth in the number of mounts.
