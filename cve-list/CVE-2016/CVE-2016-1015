Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.343 and 19.x through 21.x before
21.0.0.213 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.616 on Linux allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code by overriding NetConnection object
properties to leverage an unspecified "type confusion," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2016-1019.
