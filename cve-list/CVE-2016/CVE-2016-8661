Little Snitch version 3.0 through 3.6.1 suffer from a buffer overflow
vulnerability that could be locally exploited which could lead to an
escalation of privileges (EoP) and unauthorised ring0 access to the
operating system. The buffer overflow is related to insufficient
checking of parameters to the "OSMalloc" and "copyin" kernel API calls.
