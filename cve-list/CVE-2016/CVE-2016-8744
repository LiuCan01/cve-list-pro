Reference: MLIST:[dev] 20170210 [SECURITY] CVE-2016-8744: Apache Brooklyn, SnakeYAML configuration potentially allows remote code execution
Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3f4d09c1c1a3cdfd1da0a05c8362769b917c078eed5b6c2f8e37a761@%3Cdev.brooklyn.apache.org%3E
Reference: CONFIRM:https://brooklyn.apache.org/community/security/CVE-2016-8744.html

Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs.
SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML
should unmarshal data to a Java type. In the default configuration in
Brooklyn before 0.10.0, SnakeYAML will allow unmarshalling to any Java
type available on the classpath. This could provide an authenticated
user with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run
Java code without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the
privileges of the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability
to open files and network connections, and execute system commands.
There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this
vulnerability.
