Android 6.0 has an authentication bypass for attackers with root and
physical access. Cryptographic authentication tokens (AuthTokens) used
by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) are protected by a weak
challenge. This allows adversaries to replay previously captured
responses and use the TEE without authenticating. All apps using
authentication-gated cryptography are vulnerable to this attack, which
was confirmed on the LG Nexus 5X.
