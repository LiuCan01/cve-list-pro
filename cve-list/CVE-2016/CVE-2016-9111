Incorrect access control mechanisms in Citrix Receiver Desktop Lock
4.5 allow an attacker to bypass the authentication requirement by
leveraging physical access to a VDI for temporary disconnection of a
LAN cable. NOTE: as of 20161208, the vendor could not reproduce the
issue, stating "the researcher was unable to provide us with
information that would allow us to confirm the behaviour and, despite
extensive investigation on test deployments of supported products, we
were unable to reproduce the behaviour as he described. The researcher
has also, despite additional requests for information, ceased to
respond to us."
