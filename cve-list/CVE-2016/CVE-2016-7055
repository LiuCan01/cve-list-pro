There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery
multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that
handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis
suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are
impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in
operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's
direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient
authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous
outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among
EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one
presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in
detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely.
Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the
server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is
default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be
affected.
