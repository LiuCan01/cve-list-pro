A vulnerability in the data plane IP fragment handler of the Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) CX Context-Aware Security module
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CX module
to be unable to process further traffic, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling
of IP fragments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted fragmented IP traffic across the CX module. An exploit
could allow the attacker to exhaust free packet buffers in shared
memory (SHM), causing the CX module to be unable to process further
traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects all
versions of the ASA CX Context-Aware Security module. Cisco has not
released and will not release software updates that address this
vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this
vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva62946.
