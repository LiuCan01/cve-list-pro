pulp.spec in the installation process for Pulp 2.8.3 generates the RSA
key pairs used to validate messages between the pulp server and pulp
consumers in a directory that is world-readable before later modifying
the permissions, which might allow local users to read the generated
RSA keys via reading the key files while the installation process is
running.
