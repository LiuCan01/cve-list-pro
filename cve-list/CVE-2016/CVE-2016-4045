An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before
7.8.1-rev11. Script code can be embedded to RSS feeds using a URL
notation. In case a user clicks the corresponding link at the RSS
reader of App Suite, code gets executed at the context of the user.
Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This
can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the
web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). The attacker needs
to reside within the same context to make this attack work.
