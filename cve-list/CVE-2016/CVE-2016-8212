An issue was discovered in EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to
6.2.2. There is an Improper OCSP Validation Vulnerability. OCSP
responses have two time values: thisUpdate and nextUpdate. These
specify a validity period; however, both values are optional. Crypto-J
treats the lack of a nextUpdate as indicating that the OCSP response is
valid indefinitely instead of restricting its validity for a brief
period surrounding the thisUpdate time. This vulnerability is similar
to the issue described in CVE-2015-4748.
