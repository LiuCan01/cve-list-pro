An issue was discovered in
templates/beez3/html/com_content/article/default.php in Joomla! before
3.6.5. Inadequate permissions checks in the Beez3 layout override of
the com_content article view allow users to view articles that should
not be publicly accessible, as demonstrated by an
index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&template=beez3 request.
