IBM Cognos Business Intelligence and IBM Cognos Analytics are
vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of
user-supplied input.  A remote attacker could exploit this
vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a
victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web
site, once the URL is clicked.  An attacker could use this
vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication
credentials.
