An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8.
Script code within hyperlinks at HTML E-Mails is not getting correctly
sanitized when using base64 encoded "data" resources. This allows an
attacker to provide hyperlinks that may execute script code instead of
directing to a proper location. Malicious script code can be executed
within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or
triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail,
deleting data etc.).
