The gnutls_ocsp_resp_check_crt function in lib/x509/ocsp.c in GnuTLS
before 3.4.15 and 3.5.x before 3.5.4 does not verify the serial length
of an OCSP response, which might allow remote attackers to bypass an
intended certificate validation mechanism via vectors involving
trailing bytes left by gnutls_malloc.
