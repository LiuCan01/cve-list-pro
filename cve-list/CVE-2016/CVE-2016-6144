The SQL interface in SAP HANA before Revision 102 does not limit the
number of login attempts for the SYSTEM user when the
password_lock_for_system_user is not supported or is configured as
"False," which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
authentication via a brute force attack, aka SAP Security Note
2216869.
