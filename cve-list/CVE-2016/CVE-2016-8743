Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was
liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response
lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a
security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or
interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy
or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request
smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.
