The TSymbolTableLevel class in ANGLE, as used in Mozilla Firefox
before 47.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.2 on Windows, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and
application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
triggering use of a WebGL shader that writes to an array.
