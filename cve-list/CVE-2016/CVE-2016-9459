Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are
vulnerable to a log pollution vulnerability potentially leading to a
local XSS. The download log functionality in the admin screen is
delivering the log in JSON format to the end-user. The file was
delivered with an attachment disposition forcing the browser to
download the document. However, Firefox running on Microsoft Windows
would offer the user to open the data in the browser as an HTML
document. Thus any injected data in the log would be executed.
