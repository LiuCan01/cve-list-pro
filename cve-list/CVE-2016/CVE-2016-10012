The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication
compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a
bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local
users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed
privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data
structures.
