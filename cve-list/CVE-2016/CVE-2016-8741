The Apache Qpid Broker for Java can be configured to use different so
called AuthenticationProviders to handle user authentication. Among
the choices are the SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256
AuthenticationProvider types. It was discovered that these
AuthenticationProviders in Apache Qpid Broker for Java 6.0.x before
6.0.6 and 6.1.x before 6.1.1 prematurely terminate the SCRAM SASL
negotiation if the provided user name does not exist thus allowing
remote attacker to determine the existence of user accounts. The
Vulnerability does not apply to AuthenticationProviders other than
SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256.
