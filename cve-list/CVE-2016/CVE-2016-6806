Reference: MLIST:[wicket-announce] 20161108 CVE-2016-6806: Apache Wicket CSRF detection vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/074b72585f4b7c6adda1af52aecbfe1be23c6d6f5bb9382270f059cd@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E

Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0, 7.x before 7.5.0, and 8.0.0-M1
provide a CSRF prevention measure that fails to discover some cross
origin requests. The mitigation is to not only check the Origin HTTP
header, but also take the Referer HTTP header into account when no
Origin was provided. Furthermore, not all Wicket server side targets
were subjected to the CSRF check. This was also fixed.
