An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before
7.8.1-rev10. App Suite frontend offers to control whether a user wants
to store cookies that exceed the session duration. This functionality
is useful when logging in from clients with reduced privileges or
shared environments. However the setting was incorrectly recognized and
cookies were stored regardless of this setting when the login was
performed using a non-interactive login method. In case the setting was
enforced by middleware configuration or the user went through the
interactive login page, the workflow was correct. Cookies with
authentication information may become available to other users on
shared environments. In case the user did not properly log out from the
session, third parties with access to the same client can access a
user's account.
