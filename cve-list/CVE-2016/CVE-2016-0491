Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite
component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and
12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect integrity and availability
via unknown vectors related to Load Testing for Web Apps.  NOTE: the
previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on third-party claims that the UploadFileAction servlet
allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary
files via an * (asterisk) character in the fileType parameter.
