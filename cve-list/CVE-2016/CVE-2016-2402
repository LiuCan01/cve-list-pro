Reference: CONFIRM:https://publicobject.com/2016/02/11/okhttp-certificate-pinning-vulnerability/

OkHttp before 2.7.4 and 3.x before 3.1.2 allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to bypass certificate pinning by sending a certificate chain
with a certificate from a non-pinned trusted CA and the pinned
certificate.
