The adreno_perfcounter_query_group function in
drivers/gpu/msm/adreno_perfcounter.c in the Adreno GPU driver for the
Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android
contributions for MSM devices and other products, uses an incorrect
integer data type, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service
(integer overflow, heap-based buffer overflow, and incorrect memory
allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
IOCTL_KGSL_PERFCOUNTER_QUERY ioctl call.
