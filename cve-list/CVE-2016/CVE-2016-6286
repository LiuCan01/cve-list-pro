Reference: MLIST:[chicken-announce] 20160721 [SECURITY] spiffy-cgi-handlers and http-client updated to prevent "httpoxy" attack

The "spiffy-cgi-handlers" egg would convert a nonexistent "Proxy"
header to the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which would allow
attackers to direct CGI programs which use this environment variable
to use an attacker-specified HTTP proxy server (also known as a
"httpoxy" attack). This affects all versions of spiffy-cgi-handlers
before 0.5.
