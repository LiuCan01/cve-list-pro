An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.0-rev8. OX
Guard uses an authentication token to identify and transfer guest
users' credentials.  The OX Guard API acts as a padding oracle by
responding with different error codes depending on whether the
provided token matches the encryption padding.  In combination with
AES-CBC, this allows attackers to guess the correct padding. 
Attackers may run brute-forcing attacks on the content of the guest
authentication token and discover user credentials.  For a practical
attack vector, the guest users needs to have logged in, the content
of the guest user's "OxReaderID" cookie and the value of the "auth"
parameter needs to be known to the attacker.
