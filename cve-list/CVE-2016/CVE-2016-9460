Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are
vulnerable to a content-spoofing attack in the files app. The location
bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An
attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and
use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
