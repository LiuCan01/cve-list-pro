Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper
authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as
implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users
and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to
unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The
previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in
the group.
