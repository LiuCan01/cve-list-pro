The getObject method of the javax.jms.ObjectMessage class in the (1)
JMS Core client, (2) Artemis broker, and (3) Artemis REST component in
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis before 1.4.0 might allow remote authenticated
users with permission to send messages to the Artemis broker to
deserialize arbitrary objects and execute arbitrary code by leveraging
gadget classes being present on the Artemis classpath.
