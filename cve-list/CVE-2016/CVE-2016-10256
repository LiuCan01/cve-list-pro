The Symantec ProxySG 6.5 (prior to 6.5.10.6), 6.6, and 6.7 (prior to
6.7.2.1) management console is susceptible to a reflected XSS
vulnerability. A remote attacker can use a crafted management console
URL in a phishing attack to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the
management console web client application. This is a separate
vulnerability from CVE-2016-10257.
