An issue was discovered in CA Unified Infrastructure Management Version
8.47 and earlier. The Unified Infrastructure Management software uses
external input to construct a pathname that should be within a
restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences
such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that
directory.
