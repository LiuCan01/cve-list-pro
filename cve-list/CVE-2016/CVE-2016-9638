In BMC Patrol before 9.13.10.02, the binary "listguests64" is
configured with the setuid bit. However, when executing it, it will
look for a binary named "virsh" using the PATH environment variable.
The "listguests64" program will then run "virsh" using root privileges.
This allows local users to elevate their privileges to root.
