Django 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before
1.10.3 use a hardcoded password for a temporary database user created
when running tests with an Oracle database, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to obtain access to the database server by leveraging
failure to manually specify a password in the database settings TEST
dictionary.
