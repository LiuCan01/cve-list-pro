Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite
component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and
12.5.0.2 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Test
Manager for Web Apps.  NOTE: the previous information is from the
January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that
this is a directory traversal vulnerability in the ActionServlet
servlet, which allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute
arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the tempfilename
parameter in a ReportImage action.
