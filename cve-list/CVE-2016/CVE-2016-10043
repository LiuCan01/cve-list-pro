An issue was discovered in Radisys MRF Web Panel (SWMS) 9.0.1. The
MSM_MACRO_NAME POST parameter in /swms/ms.cgi was discovered to be
vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It is possible to use the
pipe character (|) to inject arbitrary OS commands and retrieve the
output in the application's responses. Attackers could execute
unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the
software, or read, write, and modify data for which the attacker does
not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application
is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any
malicious activities may appear to come from the application or the
application's owner (apache user).
