A vulnerability has been identified in a signed kernel driver for the
BIOS of some ThinkPad systems that can allow an attacker with Windows
administrator-level privileges to call System Management Mode (SMM)
services. This could lead to a denial of service attack or allow
certain BIOS variables or settings to be altered (such as boot
sequence). The setting or changing of BIOS passwords is not affected
by this vulnerability.
