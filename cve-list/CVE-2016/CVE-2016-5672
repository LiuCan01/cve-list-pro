Intel Crosswalk before 19.49.514.5, 20.x before 20.50.533.11, 21.x
before 21.51.546.0, and 22.x before 22.51.549.0 interprets a user's
acceptance of one invalid X.509 certificate to mean that all invalid
X.509 certificates should be accepted without prompting, which makes
it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers and
obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
