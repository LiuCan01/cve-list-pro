GitLab versions 8.9.x and above contain a critical security flaw in the
"import/export project" feature of GitLab. Added in GitLab 8.9, this
feature allows a user to export and then re-import their projects as
tape archive files (tar). All GitLab versions prior to 8.13.0
restricted this feature to administrators only. Starting with version
8.13.0 this feature was made available to all users. This feature did
not properly check for symbolic links in user-provided archives and
therefore it was possible for an authenticated user to retrieve the
contents of any file accessible to the GitLab service account. This
included sensitive files such as those that contain secret tokens used
by the GitLab service to authenticate users. GitLab CE and EE versions
8.13.0 through 8.13.2, 8.12.0 through 8.12.7, 8.11.0 through 8.11.10,
8.10.0 through 8.10.12, and 8.9.0 through 8.9.11 are affected.
