When an application with unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from
1.7.0 to 2.4.3, Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7 on classpath uses
standard Java serialization mechanisms, e.g. to communicate between
servers or to store local data, it was possible for an attacker to
bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when
deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not
isolate the code which deserializes objects were subject to this
vulnerability.
