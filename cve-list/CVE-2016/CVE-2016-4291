When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a field from the
structure in an operation that can cause the integer to overflow. This
result is then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due to
the lack of bounds checking on the integer, the allocated memory
buffer can be made to be undersized at which point the reading of file
data will write outside the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to
code execution under the context of the application.
