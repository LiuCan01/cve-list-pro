A buffer overflow in Redis 3.2.x prior to 3.2.4 causes arbitrary code
execution when a crafted command is sent. An out of bounds write
vulnerability exists in the handling of the client-output-buffer-limit
option during the CONFIG SET command for the Redis data structure
store. A crafted CONFIG SET command can lead to an out of bounds write
potentially resulting in code execution.
