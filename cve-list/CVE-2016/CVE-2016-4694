The Apache HTTP Server in Apple OS X before 10.12 and OS X Server
before 5.2 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not
protect applications from the presence of untrusted CGI client data in
the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote
attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an
arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request,
aka an "httpoxy" issue, a related issue to CVE-2016-5387.
