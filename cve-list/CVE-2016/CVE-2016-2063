Stack-based buffer overflow in the supply_lm_input_write function in
drivers/thermal/supply_lm_core.c in the MSM Thermal driver for the
Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android
contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to
cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted application that sends a large amount of data through
the debugfs interface.
