An issue was discovered in Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) Alaris
8015 Point of Care (PC) unit, Version 9.5 and prior versions, and
Version 9.7. An unauthorized user with physical access to an Alaris
8015 PC unit may be able to obtain unencrypted wireless network
authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data by
disassembling an Alaris 8015 PC unit and accessing the device's flash
memory. Older software versions of the Alaris 8015 PC unit, Version 9.5
and prior versions, store wireless network authentication credentials
and other sensitive technical data on the affected device's removable
flash memory. Being able to remove the flash memory from the affected
device reduces the risk of detection, allowing an attacker to extract
stored data at the attacker's convenience.
