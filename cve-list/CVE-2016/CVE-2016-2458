The compose functionality in AOSP Mail in Android 5.0.x before 5.0.2,
5.1.x before 5.1.1, and 6.x before 2016-05-01 does not properly
restrict attachments, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted application, related to ComposeActivity.java
and ComposeActivityEmail.java, aka internal bug 27335139.
