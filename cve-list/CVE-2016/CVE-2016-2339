An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the
Fiddle::Function.new "initialize" function functionality of Ruby. In
Fiddle::Function.new "initialize" heap buffer "arg_types" allocation
is made based on args array length. Specially constructed object
passed as element of args array can increase this array size after
mentioned allocation and cause heap overflow.
