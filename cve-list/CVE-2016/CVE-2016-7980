Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
ecrire/exec/valider_xml.php in SPIP 3.1.2 and earlier allows remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests
that execute the XML validator on a local file via a crafted
valider_xml request.  NOTE: this issue can be combined with
CVE-2016-7998 to execute arbitrary PHP code.
