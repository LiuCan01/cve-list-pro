steps/mail/sendmail.inc in Roundcube before 1.1.7 and 1.2.x before
1.2.3, when no SMTP server is configured and the sendmail program is
enabled, does not properly restrict the use of custom envelope-from
addresses on the sendmail command line, which allows remote
authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a modified HTTP
request that sends a crafted e-mail message.
