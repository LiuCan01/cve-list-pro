SOGo before 2.3.12 and 3.x before 3.1.1 does not restrict access to
the UID and DTSTAMP attributes, which allows remote authenticated
users to obtain sensitive information about appointments with the
"View the Date & Time" restriction, as demonstrated by correlating
UIDs and DTSTAMPs between all users.
