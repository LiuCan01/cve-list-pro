Crestron Electronics DM-TXRX-100-STR devices with firmware before
1.3039.00040 use a hardcoded 0xb9eed4d955a59eb3 X.509 certificate from
an OpenSSL Test Certification Authority, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against HTTPS
sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship.
