Integer overflow in the gdImageWebpCtx function in gd_webp.c in the GD
Graphics Library (aka libgd) through 2.2.3, as used in PHP through
7.0.11, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via crafted imagewebp and imagedestroy calls.
