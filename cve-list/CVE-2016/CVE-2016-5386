The net/http package in Go through 1.6 does not attempt to address RFC
3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect
CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the
HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to
redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary
proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an
"httpoxy" issue.
