XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XACML flow feature in
WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0 before WSO2-CARBON-PATCH-4.4.0-0231 allows
remote authenticated users with access to XACML features to read
arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, conduct server-side
request forgery (SSRF) attacks, or have unspecified other impact via a
crafted XACML request to entitlement/eval-policy-submit.jsp.  NOTE:
this issue can be combined with CVE-2016-4311 to exploit the
vulnerability without credentials.
