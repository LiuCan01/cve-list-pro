The TCP implementation in Cisco Videoscape Distribution Suite for
Internet Streaming (VDS-IS) 3.3(0), 3.3(1), 4.0(0), and 4.1(0) does
not properly initiate new TCP sessions when a previous session is in a
FIN wait state, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (TCP outage) via vectors involving FIN packets, aka Bug ID
CSCuy45136.
