An issue was discovered in Rockwell Automation Logix5000 Programmable
Automation Controller FRN 16.00 through 21.00 (excluding all firmware
versions prior to FRN 16.00, which are not affected). By sending
malformed common industrial protocol (CIP) packet, an attacker may be
able to overflow a stack-based buffer and execute code on the
controller or initiate a nonrecoverable fault resulting in a denial of
service.
