The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote
Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative
interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php
(/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and
unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't
properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and
'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for
system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously
suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the
variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the case. The Sophos
ID is NSWA-1258.
