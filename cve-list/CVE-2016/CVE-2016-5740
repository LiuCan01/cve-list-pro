An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before
7.8.2-rev5. JavaScript code can be used as part of ical attachments
within scheduling E-Mails. This content, for example an appointment's
location, will be presented to the user at the E-Mail App, depending
on the invitation workflow. This code gets executed within the context
of the user's current session. Malicious script code can be executed
within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or
triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail,
deleting data etc.).
