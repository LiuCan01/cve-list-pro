An exploitable uninitialized variable vulnerability which leads to a
stack-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to
convert a malformed PDF to XML a stack variable will be left
uninitialized which will later be used to fetch a length that is used
in a copy operation. In most cases this will allow an aggressor to
write outside the bounds of a stack buffer which is used to contain
colors. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
account running the tool.
