An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1,
13.x before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x
before 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip channel
driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip
the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather
than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs,
Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as if it were
whitespace. This means that headers such as Contactx01: will be seen
as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until
Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such
a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause
a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication
since it believes the request is an in-dialog request. However, because
of the bug described above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog
request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new
call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted
sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for
authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is
dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are
currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use
chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you.
