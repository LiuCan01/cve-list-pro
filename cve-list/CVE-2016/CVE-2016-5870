The msm_ipc_router_close function in net/ipc_router/ipc_router_socket.c
in the ipc_router component for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in
Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices
and other products, allow attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
triggering failure of an accept system call for an AF_MSM_IPC socket.
