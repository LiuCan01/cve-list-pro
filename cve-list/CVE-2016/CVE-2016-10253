An issue was discovered in Erlang/OTP 18.x. Erlang's generation of
compiled regular expressions is vulnerable to a heap overflow. Regular
expressions using a malformed extpattern can indirectly specify an
offset that is used as an array index. This ordinal permits arbitrary
regions within the erts_alloc arena to be both read and written to.
