media/libmedia/IOMX.cpp in mediaserver in Android 6.x before
2016-04-01 does not initialize certain metadata buffer pointers, which
allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory,
and consequently bypass an unspecified protection mechanism, via
unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by obtaining Signature or
SignatureOrSystem access, aka internal bug 26324358.
