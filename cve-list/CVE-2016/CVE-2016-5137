The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in
WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security
Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
52.0.2743.82, does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs and
does not apply ws :80 policies to wss :443 URLs, which makes it easier
for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has
been visited by reading a CSP report.  NOTE: this vulnerability is
associated with a specification change after CVE-2016-1617 resolution.
