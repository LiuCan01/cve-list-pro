An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x
before 13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is
received with the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated
using a space the code responsible for parsing will recursively call
itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly
handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require the
endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not
require the endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for
chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still
processed and the crash occurs.
