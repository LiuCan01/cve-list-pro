libxml2 2.9.4 and earlier, as used in XMLSec 1.2.23 and earlier and
other products, does not offer a flag directly indicating that the
current document may be read but other files may not be opened, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity
(XXE) attacks via a crafted document.
