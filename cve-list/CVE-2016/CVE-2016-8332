A buffer overflow in OpenJPEG 2.1.1 causes arbitrary code execution
when parsing a crafted image. An exploitable code execution
vulnerability exists in the jpeg2000 image file format parser as
implemented in the OpenJpeg library. A specially crafted jpeg2000 file
can cause an out of bound heap write resulting in heap corruption
leading to arbitrary code execution. For a successful attack, the
target user needs to open a malicious jpeg2000 file. The jpeg2000
image file format is mostly used for embedding images inside PDF
documents and the OpenJpeg library is used by a number of popular PDF
renderers making PDF documents a likely attack vector.
