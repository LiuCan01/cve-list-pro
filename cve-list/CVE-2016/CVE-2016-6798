In the XSS Protection API module before 1.0.12 in Apache Sling, the
method XSS.getValidXML() uses an insecure SAX parser to validate the
input string, which allows for XXE attacks in all scripts which use
this method to validate user input, potentially allowing an attacker
to read sensitive data on the filesystem, perform
same-site-request-forgery (SSRF), port-scanning behind the firewall or
DoS the application.
