When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a property
record within the Workbook stream, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to
allocate space for an element using a length from the file. When
copying user-supplied data to this buffer, however, the application
will use a different size which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
This vulnerability can lead to code-execution under the context of the
application.
