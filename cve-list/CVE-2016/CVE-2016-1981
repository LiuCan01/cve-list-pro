QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the e1000 NIC emulation support
is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while
processing data via transmit or receive descriptors, provided the
initial receive/transmit descriptor head (TDH/RDH) is set outside the
allocated descriptor buffer. A privileged user inside guest could use
this flaw to crash the QEMU instance resulting in DoS.
