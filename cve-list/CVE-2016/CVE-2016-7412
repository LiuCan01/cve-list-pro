ext/mysqlnd/mysqlnd_wireprotocol.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before
7.0.11 does not verify that a BIT field has the UNSIGNED_FLAG flag,
which allows remote MySQL servers to cause a denial of service
(heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via crafted field metadata.
