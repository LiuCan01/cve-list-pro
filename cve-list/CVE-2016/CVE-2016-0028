Outlook Web Access (OWA) in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 SP1,
Cumulative Update 11, and Cumulative Update 12 and 2016 Gold and
Cumulative Update 1 does not properly restrict loading of IMG
elements, which makes it easier for remote attackers to track users
via a crafted HTML e-mail message, aka "Microsoft Exchange Information
Disclosure Vulnerability."
