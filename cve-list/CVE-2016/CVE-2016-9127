Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF). The password recovery form in Revive Adserver is vulnerable to
CSRF attacks. This vulnerability could be exploited to send a large
number of password recovery emails to the registered users, especially
in conjunction with a bug that caused recovery emails to be sent to all
the users at once. Both issues have been fixed.
