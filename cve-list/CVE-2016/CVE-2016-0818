The caching functionality in the TrustManagerImpl class in
TrustManagerImpl.java in Conscrypt in Android 4.x before 4.4.4, 5.x
before 5.1.1 LMY49H, and 6.x before 2016-03-01 mishandles the
distinction between an intermediate CA and a trusted root CA, which
allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers by leveraging
access to an intermediate CA to issue a certificate, aka internal bug
26232830.
