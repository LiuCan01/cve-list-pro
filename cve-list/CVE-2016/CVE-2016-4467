The C client and C-based client bindings in the Apache Qpid Proton
library before 0.13.1 on Windows do not properly verify that the
server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
(CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when using the
SChannel-based security layer, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
