The mod_dontdothat component of the mod_dav_svn Apache module in
Subversion as packaged in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.11 does not
properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote
authenticated users with access to the webdav repository to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption and httpd crash).  NOTE: Exists
as a regression to CVE-2009-1955.
