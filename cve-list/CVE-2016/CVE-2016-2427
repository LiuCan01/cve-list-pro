** DISPUTED ** The AES-GCM specification in RFC 5084, as used in
Android 5.x and 6.x, recommends 12 octets for the aes-ICVlen parameter
field, which might make it easier for attackers to defeat a
cryptographic protection mechanism and discover an authentication key
via a crafted application, aka internal bug 26234568.  NOTE: The
vendor disputes the existence of this potential issue in Android,
stating "This CVE was raised in error: it referred to the
authentication tag size in GCM, whose default according to ASN.1
encoding (12 bytes) can lead to vulnerabilities. After careful
consideration, it was decided that the insecure default value of 12
bytes was a default only for the encoding and not default anywhere
else in Android, and hence no vulnerability existed."
