Heap-based buffer overflow in the wcnss_wlan_write function in
drivers/net/wireless/wcnss/wcnss_wlan.c in the wcnss_wlan device
driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center
(QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products,
allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact by writing to /dev/wcnss_wlan with an
unexpected amount of data.
