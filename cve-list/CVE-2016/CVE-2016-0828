The BnGraphicBufferConsumer::onTransact function in
libs/gui/IGraphicBufferConsumer.cpp in mediaserver in Android 5.x
before 5.1.1 LMY49H and 6.x before 2016-03-01 does not initialize a
certain slot variable, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive
information, and consequently bypass an unspecified protection
mechanism, by triggering an ATTACH_BUFFER action, as demonstrated by
obtaining Signature or SignatureOrSystem access, aka internal bug
26338113.
