When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a static size to
allocate a heap buffer yet explicitly trust a size from the file when
modifying data inside of it. Due to this, an aggressor can corrupt
memory outside the bounds of this buffer which can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.
