An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27.
The "defer" servlet offers to redirect a client to a specified URL.
Since some checks were missing, arbitrary URLs could be provided as
redirection target. Users can be tricked to follow a link to a
trustworthy domain but end up at an unexpected service later on. This
vulnerability can be used to prepare and enhance phishing attacks.
