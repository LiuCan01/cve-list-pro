An issue was discovered in Pivotal GemFire for PCF 1.6.x versions prior
to 1.6.5 and 1.7.x versions prior to 1.7.1. The gfsh (Geode Shell)
endpoint, used by operators and application developers to connect to
their cluster, is unauthenticated and publicly accessible. Because
HTTPS communications are terminated at the gorouter, communications
from the gorouter to GemFire clusters are unencrypted. An attacker
could run any command available on gfsh and could cause denial of
service, lost confidentiality of data, escalate privileges, or
eavesdrop on other communications between the gorouter and the cluster.
