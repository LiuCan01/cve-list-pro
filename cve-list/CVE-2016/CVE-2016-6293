The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in
International Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does
not ensure that there is a '0' character at the end of a certain
temporary array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument.
