The DrawImage function in MagickCore/draw.c in ImageMagick before
6.9.4-0 and 7.x before 7.0.1-2 makes an incorrect function call in
attempting to locate the next token, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
