An installer defect known as an "unquoted Windows search path
vulnerability" affected the Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.3 installers
for Windows. The PC must have previously been infected by a Trojan
Horse application (or user) running with administrative privilege. Any
installer with the unquoted search path vulnerability becomes a
delayed trigger for the exploit.
