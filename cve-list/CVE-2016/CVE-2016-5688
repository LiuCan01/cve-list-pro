The WPG parser in ImageMagick before 6.9.4-4 and 7.x before 7.0.1-5,
when a memory limit is set, allows remote attackers to have
unspecified impact via vectors related to the SetImageExtent
return-value check, which trigger (1) a heap-based buffer overflow in
the SetPixelIndex function or an invalid write operation in the (2)
ScaleCharToQuantum or (3) SetPixelIndex functions.
