The racoon daemon in IPsec-Tools 0.8.2 contains a remotely exploitable
computational-complexity attack when parsing and storing ISAKMP
fragments. The implementation permits a remote attacker to exhaust
computational resources on the remote endpoint by repeatedly sending
ISAKMP fragment packets in a particular order such that the worst-case
computational complexity is realized in the algorithm utilized to
determine if reassembly of the fragments can take place.
