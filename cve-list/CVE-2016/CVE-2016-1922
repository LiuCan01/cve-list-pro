QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the TPR optimization for 32-bit
Windows guests support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference
flaw. It occurs while doing I/O port write operations via hmp
interface. In that, 'current_cpu' remains null, which leads to the
null pointer dereference. A user or process could use this flaw to
crash the QEMU instance, resulting in DoS issue.
