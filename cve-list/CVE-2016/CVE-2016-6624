An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin involving improper enforcement
of the IP-based authentication rules. When phpMyAdmin is used with
IPv6 in a proxy server environment, and the proxy server is in the
allowed range but the attacking computer is not allowed, this
vulnerability can allow the attacking computer to connect despite the
IP rules. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior
to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
