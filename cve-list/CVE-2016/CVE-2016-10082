include/functions_installer.inc.php in Serendipity through 2.0.5 is
vulnerable to File Inclusion and a possible Code Execution attack
during a first-time installation because it fails to sanitize the
dbType POST parameter before adding it to an include() call in the
bundled-libs/serendipity_generateFTPChecksums.php file.
