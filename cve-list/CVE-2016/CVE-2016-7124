ext/standard/var_unserializer.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before
7.0.10 mishandles certain invalid objects, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via crafted serialized data that leads to a (1)
__destruct call or (2) magic method call.
