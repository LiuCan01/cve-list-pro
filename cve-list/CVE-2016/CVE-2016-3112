client/consumer/cli.py in Pulp before 2.8.3 writes consumer private
keys to etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem as world-readable,
which allows remote authenticated users to obtain the consumer private
keys and escalate privileges by reading
/etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert, and authenticating as a consumer
user.
