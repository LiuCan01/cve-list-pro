An issue was discovered in Locus Energy LGate prior to 1.05H, LGate 50,
LGate 100, LGate 101, LGate 120, and LGate 320. Locus Energy meters use
a PHP script to manage the energy meter parameters for voltage
monitoring and network configuration. The PHP code does not properly
validate information that is sent in the POST request.
