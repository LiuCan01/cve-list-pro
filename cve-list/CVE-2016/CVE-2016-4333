The HDF5 1.8.16 library allocating space for the array using a value
from the file has an impact within the loop for initializing said
array allowing a value within the file to modify the loop's
terminator. Due to this, an aggressor can cause the loop's index to
point outside the bounds of the array when initializing it.
