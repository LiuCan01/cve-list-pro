Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before
9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the files app. The
location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters.
An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure
and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the
user.
