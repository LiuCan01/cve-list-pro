An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8.
SVG files can be used as mp3 album covers. In case their XML structure
contains script code, that code may get executed when calling the
related cover URL. Malicious script code can be executed within a
user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering
unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data
etc.).
