Receipt of a specifically malformed IPv6 packet processed by the
router may trigger a line card reset: processor exception 0x68616c74
(halt) in task: scheduler. The line card will reboot and recover
without user interaction. However, additional specifically malformed
packets may cause follow-on line card resets and lead to an extended
service outage. This issue only affects E Series routers with IPv6
licensed and enabled. Routers not configured to process IPv6 traffic
are unaffected by this vulnerability. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any
malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. No other Juniper
Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
