The file scanning mechanism of JFilterInput::isFileSafe() in Joomla!
CMS before 3.6.5 does not consider alternative PHP file extensions when
checking uploaded files for PHP content, which enables a user to upload
and execute files with the `.php6`, `.php7`, `.phtml`, and `.phpt`
extensions. Additionally, JHelperMedia::canUpload() did not blacklist
these file extensions as uploadable file types.
