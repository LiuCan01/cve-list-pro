An issue was discovered in Sprecher Automation SPRECON-E Service
Program before 3.43 SP0. Under certain preconditions, it is possible to
execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a
user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and
authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After
that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of
client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently
acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order
to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have
both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as
access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program
running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service
connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed
telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running
software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.
