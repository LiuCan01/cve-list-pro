A null pointer dereference bug affects the 16.02 and many old versions
of p7zip. A lack of null pointer check for the variable
folders.PackPositions in function
CInArchive::ReadAndDecodePackedStreams in CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zIn.cpp,
as used in the 7z.so library and in 7z applications, will cause a crash
and a denial of service when decoding malformed 7z files.
