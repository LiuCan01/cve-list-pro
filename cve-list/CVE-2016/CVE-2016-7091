sudo: It was discovered that the default sudo configuration on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and possibly other Linux implementations preserves
the value of INPUTRC which could lead to information disclosure. A
local user with sudo access to a restricted program that uses readline
could use this flaw to read content from specially formatted files
with elevated privileges provided by sudo.
