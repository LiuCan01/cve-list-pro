Product: Apache Cordova Android 5.2.2 and earlier. The application
calls methods of the Log class. Messages passed to these methods
(Log.v(), Log.d(), Log.i(), Log.w(), and Log.e()) are stored in a
series of circular buffers on the device. By default, a maximum of
four 16 KB rotated logs are kept in addition to the current log. The
logged data can be read using Logcat on the device. When using
platforms prior to Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), the log data is not
sandboxed per application; any application installed on the device has
the capability to read data logged by other applications.
