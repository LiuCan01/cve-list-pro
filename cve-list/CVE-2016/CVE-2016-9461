Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not
properly verifying edit check permissions on WebDAV copy actions. The
WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV
COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a
read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to
modify existing files.
