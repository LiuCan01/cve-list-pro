The msm_ipc_router_bind_control_port function in
net/ipc_router/ipc_router_core.c in the IPC router kernel module for
the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC)
Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not
verify that a port is a client port, which allows attackers to gain
privileges or cause a denial of service (race condition and list
corruption) by making many BIND_CONTROL_PORT ioctl calls.
