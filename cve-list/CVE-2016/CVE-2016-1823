The IOHIDDevice::handleReportWithTime function in Apple iOS before
9.3.2, OS X before 10.11.5, tvOS before 9.2.1, and watchOS before
2.2.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged
context or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and memory
corruption) via a crafted IOHIDReportType enum, which triggers an
incorrect cast, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-1824.
