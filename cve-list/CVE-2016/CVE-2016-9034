An exploitable buffer overflow exists in the Joyent SmartOS
20161110T013148Z Hyprlofs file system. The vulnerability is present in
the Ioctl system call with the command HYPRLOFS_ADD_ENTRIES when
dealing with 32-bit file systems. An attacker can craft an input that
can cause a buffer overflow in the nm variable leading to an out of
bounds memory access and could result in potential privilege
escalation. This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2016-9032.
