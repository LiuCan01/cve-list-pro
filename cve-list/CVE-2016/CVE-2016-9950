An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. There is a path
traversal issue in the Apport crash file "Package" and "SourcePackage"
fields. These fields are used to build a path to the package specific
hook files in the /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory. An
attacker can exploit this path traversal to execute arbitrary Python
files from the local system.
