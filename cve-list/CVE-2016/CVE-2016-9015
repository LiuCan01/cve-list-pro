Versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the Python urllib3 library suffer from a
vulnerability that can cause them, in certain configurations, to not
correctly validate TLS certificates. This places users of the library
with those configurations at risk of man-in-the-middle and information
leakage attacks. This vulnerability affects users using versions 1.17
and 1.18 of the urllib3 library, who are using the optional PyOpenSSL
support for TLS instead of the regular standard library TLS backend,
and who are using OpenSSL 1.1.0 via PyOpenSSL. This is an extremely
uncommon configuration, so the security impact of this vulnerability
is low.
