By flooding a Juniper Networks router running Junos OS with specially
crafted IPv6 traffic, all available resources can be consumed, leading
to the inability to store next hop information for legitimate traffic.
In extreme cases, the crafted IPv6 traffic may result in a total
resource exhaustion and kernel panic. The issue is triggered by
traffic destined to the router. Transit traffic does not trigger the
vulnerability. This issue only affects devices with IPv6 enabled and
configured. Devices not configured to process IPv6 traffic are
unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue was found during internal
product security testing. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious
exploitation of this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper
