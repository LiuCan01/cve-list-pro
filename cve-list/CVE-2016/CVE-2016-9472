Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected XSS. The
Revive Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected
XSS attack via the dbHost, dbUser, and possibly other parameters. It
has to be noted that the window for such attack vectors to be possible
is extremely narrow and it is very unlikely that such an attack could
be actually effective.
