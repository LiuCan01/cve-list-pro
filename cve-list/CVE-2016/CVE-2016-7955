The logcheck function in session.inc in AlienVault OSSIM before 5.3.1,
when an action has been created, and USM before 5.3.1 allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication and consequently obtain sensitive
information, modify the application, or execute arbitrary code as root
via an "AV Report Scheduler" HTTP User-Agent header.
