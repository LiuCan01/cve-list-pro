Juniper Junos OS before 12.1X46-D50 on SRX Series devices reverts to
"safe mode" authentication and allows root CLI logins without a
password after a failed upgrade to 12.1X46, which might allow local
users to gain privileges by leveraging use of the "request system
software" command with the "partition" option.
