The Autofill implementation in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79
mishandles the interaction between field updates and JavaScript code
that triggers a frame deletion, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2016-1690.
