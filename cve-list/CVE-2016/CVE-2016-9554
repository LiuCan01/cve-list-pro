The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version
4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in
its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in
MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the
component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX
wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information
passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class
function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec()
with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The
page that contains the vulnerabilities,
/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command
answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to
that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is:
'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access
to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.
