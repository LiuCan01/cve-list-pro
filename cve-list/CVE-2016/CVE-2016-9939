Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a bug in its
ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a memory block
based on the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there is not enough
content octets in the ASN.1 object, then the function will fail and
the memory block will be zeroed even if its unused. There is a
noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation.
