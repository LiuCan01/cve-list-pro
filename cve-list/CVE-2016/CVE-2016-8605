The mkdir procedure of GNU Guile temporarily changed the process'
umask to zero. During that time window, in a multithreaded
application, other threads could end up creating files with insecure
permissions. For example, mkdir without the optional mode argument
would create directories as 0777. This is fixed in Guile 2.0.13. Prior
versions are affected.
