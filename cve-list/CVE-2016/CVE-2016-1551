ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p3 and NTPsec
a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 relies on the underlying
operating system to protect it from requests that impersonate
reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like other
peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip
address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches
the receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record
and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the
typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in
danger of having its time controlled by an attacker.
