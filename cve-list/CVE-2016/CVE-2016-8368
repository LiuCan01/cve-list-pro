An issue was discovered in Mitsubishi Electric Automation MELSEC-Q
series Ethernet interface modules QJ71E71-100, all versions,
QJ71E71-B5, all versions, and QJ71E71-B2, all versions. The affected
Ethernet interface module is connected to a MELSEC-Q PLC, which may
allow a remote attacker to connect to the PLC via Port 5002/TCP and
cause a denial of service, requiring the PLC to be reset to resume
operation. This is caused by an Unrestricted Externally Accessible
Lock.
