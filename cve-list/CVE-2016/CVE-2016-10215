An issue was discovered in Fastspot BigTree bigtree-form-builder before
1.2. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of
user-supplied data in multiple HTTP POST parameters passed to a
"site/index.php/../../extensions/com.fastspot.form-builder/ajax/redraw-field.php"
URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
