A BIG-IP virtual server configured with a Client SSL profile that has
the non-default Session Tickets option enabled may leak up to 31 bytes
of uninitialized memory. A remote attacker may exploit this
vulnerability to obtain Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) session IDs from
other sessions. It is possible that other data from uninitialized
memory may be returned as well.
