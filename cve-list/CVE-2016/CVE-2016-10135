An issue was discovered on LG devices using the MTK chipset with
L(5.0/5.1), M(6.0/6.0.1), and N(7.0) software, and RCA Voyager Tablet,
BLU Advance 5.0, and BLU R1 HD devices. The MTKLogger app with a
package name of com.mediatek.mtklogger has application components that
are accessible to any application that resides on the device. Namely,
the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and
com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService application
components are exported since they contain an intent filter, are not
protected by a custom permission, and do not explicitly set the
android:exported attribute to false. Therefore, these components are
exported by default and are thus accessible to any third party
application by using android.content.Intent object for communication.
These application components can be used to start and stop the logs
using Intent objects with embedded data. The available logs are the GPS
log, modem log, network log, and mobile log. The base directory that
contains the directories for the 4 types of logs is /sdcard/mtklog
which makes them accessible to apps that require the
READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. The GPS log contains the GPS
coordinates of the user as well as a timestamp for the coordinates. The
modem log contains AT commands and their parameters which allow the
user's outgoing and incoming calls and text messages to be obtained.
The network log is a tcpdump network capture. The mobile log contains
the Android log, which is not available to third-party apps as of
Android 4.1. The LG ID is LVE-SMP-160019.
