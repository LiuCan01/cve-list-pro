Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Improper Restriction of
Excessive Authentication Attempts. The login page of Revive Adserver is
vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature
was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions
to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been
introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along
with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will
effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while
an attack is in progress.
