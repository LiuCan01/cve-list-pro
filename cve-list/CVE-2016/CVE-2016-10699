D-Link DSL-2740E 1.00_BG_20150720 devices are prone to persistent XSS
attacks in the username and password fields: a remote unauthenticated
user may craft logins and passwords with script tags in them. Because
there is no sanitization in the input fields, an unaware logged-in
administrator may be a victim when checking the router logs.
