Siklu EtherHaul radios before 3.7.1 and 6.x before 6.9.0 have a
built-in, hidden root account, with an unchangeable password that is
the same across all devices. This account is accessible via both SSH
and the device's web interface and grants access to the underlying
embedded Linux OS on the device, allowing full control over it.
