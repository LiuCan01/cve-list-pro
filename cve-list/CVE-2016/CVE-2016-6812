The HTTP transport module in Apache CXF prior to 3.0.12 and 3.1.x
prior to 3.1.9 uses FormattedServiceListWriter to provide an HTML page
which lists the names and absolute URL addresses of the available
service endpoints. The module calculates the base URL using the
current HttpServletRequest. The calculated base URL is used by
FormattedServiceListWriter to build the service endpoint absolute
URLs. If the unexpected matrix parameters have been injected into the
request URL then these matrix parameters will find their way back to
the client in the services list page which represents an XSS risk to
the client.
