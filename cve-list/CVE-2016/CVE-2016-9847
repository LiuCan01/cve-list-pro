An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify
a blowfish_secret key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one
at runtime. A vulnerability was reported where the way this value is
created uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to
determine the user's blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt their
cookies. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to
4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.
