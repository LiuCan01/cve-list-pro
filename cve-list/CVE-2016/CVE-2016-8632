Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20161108 CVE-2016-8632 -- Linux kernel: tipc_msg_build() doesn't validate MTU that can trigger heap overflow

The tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel
through 4.8.11 does not validate the relationship between the minimum
fragment length and the maximum packet size, which allows local users
to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
overflow) by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
