Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was
possible to inject HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the
parser used on the URL it was not possible to include the equal sign
(=) or a space into the injected HTML, which greatly reduces the
available HTML functionality. Although it is possible to include an
HTML comment indicator to hide content.
