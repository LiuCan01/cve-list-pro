The non-existent notification listener vulnerability was introduced in
the initial Android 5.0.2 builds for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge
devices, but the vulnerability can persist on the device even after
the device has been upgraded to an Android 5.1.1 or 6.0.1 build. The
vulnerable system app gives a non-existent app the ability to read the
notifications from the device, which a third-party app can utilize if
it uses a package name of com.samsung.android.app.portalservicewidget.
This vulnerability allows an unprivileged third-party app to obtain
the text of the user's notifications, which tend to contain personal
data.
