curl and libcurl before 7.50.2, when built with NSS and the
libnsspem.so library is available at runtime, allow remote attackers
to hijack the authentication of a TLS connection by leveraging reuse
of a previously loaded client certificate from file for a connection
for which no certificate has been set, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2016-5420.
