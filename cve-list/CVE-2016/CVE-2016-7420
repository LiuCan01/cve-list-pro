Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the
requirement for a compile-time NDEBUG definition disabling the many
assert calls that are unintended in production use, which might allow
context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by
leveraging access to process memory after an assertion failure, as
demonstrated by reading a core dump.
