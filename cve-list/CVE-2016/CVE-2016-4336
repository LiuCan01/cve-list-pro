An exploitable out-of-bounds write exists in the Bzip2 parsing of the
Lexmark Perspective Document Filters conversion functionality. A
crafted Bzip2 document can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow
causing an out-of-bounds write which under the right circumstance
could potentially be leveraged by an attacker to gain arbitrary code
execution.
