Integer overflow in the rtxMemHeapAlloc function in asn1rt_a.lib in
Objective Systems ASN1C for C/C++ before 7.0.2 allows
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow), on a system running an
application compiled by ASN1C, via crafted ASN.1 data.
