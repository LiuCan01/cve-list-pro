Volume Manager Driver in Microsoft Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012
Gold and R2, and Windows RT 8.1 does not properly check whether
RemoteFX RDP USB disk accesses originate from the user who mounted a
disk, which allows local users to read arbitrary files on these disks
via RemoteFX requests, aka "Remote Desktop Protocol Drive Redirection
Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
