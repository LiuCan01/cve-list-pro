PHP through 5.6.27 and 7.x through 7.0.12 mishandles property
modification during __wakeup processing, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
via crafted serialized data, as demonstrated by Exception::__toString
with DateInterval::__wakeup.
