The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in Cisco IOS XE 2.1 through 3.17S, IOS XR 2.0.0 through 5.3.2, and
NX-OS allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(packet-processing outage) via crafted ND messages, aka Bug ID
CSCuz66542, as exploited in the wild in May 2016.
