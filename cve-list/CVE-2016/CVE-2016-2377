A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT
protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent by the server
could potentially result in an out-of-bounds write of one byte. A
malicious server can send a negative content-length in response to a
HTTP request triggering the vulnerability.
