Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, when multi-tenant SDN is enabled and
a build is run in a namespace that would normally be isolated from
pods in other namespaces, allows remote authenticated users to access
network resources on restricted pods via an s2i build with a builder
image that (1) contains ONBUILD commands or (2) does not contain a tar
binary.
