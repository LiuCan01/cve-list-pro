QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the ColdFire Fast Ethernet
Controller emulator support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue.
It could occur while receiving packets in 'mcf_fec_receive'. A
privileged user/process inside guest could use this issue to crash the
QEMU process on the host leading to DoS.
