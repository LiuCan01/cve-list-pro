The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18 through 2.4.20, when mod_http2 and
mod_ssl are enabled, does not properly recognize the "SSLVerifyClient
require" directive for HTTP/2 request authorization, which allows
remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging
the ability to send multiple requests over a single connection and
aborting a renegotiation.
