When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a
particular record within the Workbook stream, an index miscalculation
leading to a heap overlow can be made to occur in Hancom Office 2014.
The vulnerability occurs when processing data for a formula used to
render a chart via the HncChartPlugin.hplg library. Due to a lack of
bounds-checking when incrementing an index that is used for writing
into a buffer for formulae, the application can be made to write
pointer data outside its bounds which can lead to code execution under
the context of the application.
