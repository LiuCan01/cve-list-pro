libndp before 1.6, as used in NetworkManager, does not properly
validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages,
which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or
cause a denial of service (network connectivity disruption) by
advertising a node as a router from a non-local network.
