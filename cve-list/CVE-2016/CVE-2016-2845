The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in
Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.75, does not ignore a URL's path
component in the case of a ServiceWorker fetch, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information about visited web pages by
reading CSP violation reports, related to FrameFetchContext.cpp and
ResourceFetcher.cpp.
