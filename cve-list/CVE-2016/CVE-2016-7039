The IP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly
have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for
large crafted packets, as demonstrated by packets that contain only
VLAN headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-8666.
