The grade-reporting feature in Singleview (aka Single View) in Moodle
2.8.x before 2.8.11, 2.9.x before 2.9.5, and 3.0.x before 3.0.3 does
not consider the moodle/grade:manage capability, which allows remote
authenticated users to modify "Exclude grade" settings by leveraging
the Non-Editing Instructor role.
