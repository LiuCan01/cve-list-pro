Action Record in Ruby on Rails 4.2.x before 4.2.7.1 does not properly
consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record
component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers
to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks
or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request, as
demonstrated by certain "[nil]" values, a related issue to
CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694, and CVE-2013-0155.
