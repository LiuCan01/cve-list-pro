An issue was discovered in components/com_users/models/registration.php
in Joomla! before 3.6.5. Incorrect filtering of registration form data
stored to the session on a validation error enables a user to gain
access to a registered user's account and reset the user's group
mappings, username, and password, as demonstrated by submitting a form
that targets the `registration.register` task.
