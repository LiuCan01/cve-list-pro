An issue was discovered in IT ITems DataBase (ITDB) through 1.23. The
vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied
data in the "value" HTTP POST parameter passed to the

URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
