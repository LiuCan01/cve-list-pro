Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the manage_findResult
component in the search feature in Zope ZMI in Plone before 4.3.12 and
5.x before 5.0.7 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via vectors involving double quotes, as demonstrated by the
obj_ids:tokens parameter. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2016-7140.
