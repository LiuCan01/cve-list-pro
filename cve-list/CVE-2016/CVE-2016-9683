The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is
vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web
administrative interface. This vulnerability occurs in the
'extensionsettings' CGI (/cgi-bin/extensionsettings) component
responsible for handling some of the server's internal configurations.
The CGI application doesn't properly escape the information it's passed
when processing a particular multi-part form request involving scripts.
The filename of the 'scriptname' variable is read in unsanitized before
a call to system() is performed - allowing for remote command
injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to
the remote machine under the nobody user account. This is SonicWall
Issue ID 181195.
