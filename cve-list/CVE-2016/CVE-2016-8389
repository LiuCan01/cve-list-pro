An exploitable integer-overflow vulnerability exists within Iceni
Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML, it will
attempt to convert each character from a font into a polygon and then
attempt to rasterize these shapes. As the application attempts to
iterate through the rows and initializing the polygon shape in the
buffer, it will write outside of the bounds of said buffer. This can
lead to code execution under the context of the account running it.
