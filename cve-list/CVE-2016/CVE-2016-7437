SAP Netweaver 7.40 improperly logs (1) DUI and (2) DUJ events in the
SAP Security Audit Log as non-critical, which might allow local users
to hide rejected attempts to execute RFC function callbacks by
leveraging filtering of non-critical events in audit analysis reports,
aka SAP Security Note 2252312.
