The NETGEAR WNR2000v5 router allows an administrator to perform
sensitive actions by invoking the apply.cgi URL on the web server of
the device. This special URL is handled by the embedded web server
(uhttpd) and processed accordingly. The web server also contains
another URL, apply_noauth.cgi, that allows an unauthenticated user to
perform sensitive actions on the device. This functionality can be
exploited to change the router settings (such as the answers to the
password-recovery questions) and achieve remote code execution.
