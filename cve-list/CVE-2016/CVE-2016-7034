The dashbuilder in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.3.2 does not properly
handle CSRF tokens generated during an active session and includes
them in query strings, which makes easier for remote attackers to (1)
bypass CSRF protection mechanisms or (2) conduct cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) attacks by obtaining an old token.
