An exploitable out-of-bounds array access vulnerability exists in the
xrow_header_decode function of Tarantool 1.7.2.0-g8e92715. A specially
crafted packet can cause the function to access an element outside the
bounds of a global array that is used to determine the type of the
specified key's value. This can lead to an out of bounds read within
the context of the server. An attacker who exploits this vulnerability
can cause a denial of service vulnerability on the server.
