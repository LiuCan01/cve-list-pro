Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 and 3.1 do not properly validate the
origin of a request when anonymous access is granted to a
service/proxy or pod/proxy API for a specific pod, which allows remote
attackers to access API credentials in the web browser localStorage
via an access_token in the query parameter.
