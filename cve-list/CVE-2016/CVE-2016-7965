DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older uses $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST] instead of the
baseurl setting as part of the password-reset URL. This can lead to
phishing attacks. (A remote unauthenticated attacker can change the
URL's hostname via the HTTP Host header.) The vulnerability can be
triggered only if the Host header is not part of the web server routing
process (e.g., if several domains are served by the same web server).
