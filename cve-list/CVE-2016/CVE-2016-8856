Foxit Reader for Mac 2.1.0.0804 and earlier and Foxit Reader for Linux
2.1.0.0805 and earlier suffered from a vulnerability where weak file
permissions could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code.
After the installation, Foxit Reader's core files were world-writable
by default, allowing an attacker to overwrite them with backdoor code,
which when executed by privileged user would result in Privilege
Escalation, Code Execution, or both.
