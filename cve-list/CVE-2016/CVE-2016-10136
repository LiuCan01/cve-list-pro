An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups
software. The content provider named
com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package
name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read,
write, and delete files as the system user. In the
com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the
android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which
makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on
the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete
files owned by the system user. The third-party app can modify the
/data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a
notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications
as they are received on the device. This also allows the
/data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains
authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The
third-party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files
to obtain more privileges on the device.
