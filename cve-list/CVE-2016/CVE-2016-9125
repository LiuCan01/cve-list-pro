Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from session fixation, by
allowing arbitrary session identifiers to be forced and, at the same
time, by not invalidating the existing session upon a successful
authentication. Under some circumstances, that could have been an
opportunity for an attacker to steal an authenticated session.
