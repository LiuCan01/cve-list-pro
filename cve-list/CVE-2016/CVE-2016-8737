In Apache Brooklyn before 0.10.0, the REST server is vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which could permit a malicious web
site to produce a link which, if clicked whilst a user is logged in to
Brooklyn, would cause the server to execute the attacker's commands as
the user. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this
vulnerability.
