Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/01/24/5

examples/consumer/common.php in JanRain PHP OpenID library (aka
php-openid) improperly checks the openid.realm parameter against the
SERVER_NAME element in the SERVER superglobal array, which might allow
remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users via
vectors involving a crafted HTTP Host header.
