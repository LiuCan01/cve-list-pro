An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8.
Setting the user's name to JS code makes that code execute when
selecting that user's "Templates" folder from OX Documents settings.
This requires the folder to be shared to the victim. Malicious script
code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session
hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending
mail, deleting data etc.).
