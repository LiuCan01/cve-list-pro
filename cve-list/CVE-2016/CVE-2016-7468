An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to disrupt services on
F5 BIG-IP 11.4.1 - 11.5.4 devices with maliciously crafted network
traffic. This vulnerability affects virtual servers associated with
TCP profiles when the BIG-IP system's tm.tcpprogressive db variable
value is set to non-default setting "enabled". The default value for
the tm.tcpprogressive db variable is "negotiate". An attacker may be
able to disrupt traffic or cause the BIG-IP system to fail over to
another device in the device group.
