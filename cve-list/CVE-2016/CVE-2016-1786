The Page Loading implementation in WebKit in Apple iOS before 9.3 and
Safari before 9.1 mishandles HTTP responses with a 3xx (aka
redirection) status code, which allows remote attackers to spoof the
displayed URL, bypass the Same Origin Policy, and obtain sensitive
cached information via a crafted web site.
