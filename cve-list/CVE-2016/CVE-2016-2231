The Windows-based Host Interface Program (WHIP) service on Huawei
SmartAX MT882 devices V200R002B022 Arg relies on the client to send a
length field that is consistent with a buffer size, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device outage) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted traffic on TCP port
8701.
