A vulnerability in the Identity Firewall feature of Cisco ASA Software
before 9.6(2.1) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. The
vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted NetBIOS
packet in response to a NetBIOS probe sent by the ASA software. An
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain
full control of the system or cause a reload of the affected system.
Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to
exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems
configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and in single or
multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4
traffic.
