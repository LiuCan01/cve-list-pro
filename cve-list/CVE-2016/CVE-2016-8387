An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When
it attempts to convert a malformed PDF with an object encoded w/
multiple encoding types terminating with an LZW encoded type, an
overflow may occur due to a lack of bounds checking by the LZW
decoder. This can lead to code execution under the context of the
account of the user running it.
