A denial of service vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT
protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server
could potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A malicious server
or an attacker who intercepts the network traffic can send invalid
data to trigger this vulnerability and cause a crash.
