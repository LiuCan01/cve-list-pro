An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. Some data is passed to the PHP
unserialize() function without verification that it's valid serialized
data. The unserialization can result in code execution because of the
interaction with object instantiation and autoloading. All 4.6.x
versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and
4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
