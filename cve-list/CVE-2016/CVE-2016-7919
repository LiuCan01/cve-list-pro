** DISPUTED ** Moodle 3.1.2 allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via unspecified vectors, related to a "SQL
Injection" issue affecting the Administration panel function in the
installation process component.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the
relevance of this report, noting that "the person who is installing
Moodle must know database access credentials and they can access the
database directly; there is no need for them to create a SQL injection
in one of the installation dialogue fields."
