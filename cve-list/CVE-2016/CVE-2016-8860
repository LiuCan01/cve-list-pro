Tor before 0.2.8.9 and 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.4-alpha had internal
functions that were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL
termination, but the implementation of or/buffers.c did not ensure
that NUL termination was present, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (client, hidden service, relay, or authority
crash) via crafted data.
