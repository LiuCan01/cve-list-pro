A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT
protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent from the server
could potentially result in arbitrary code execution. A malicious
server or an attacker who intercepts the network traffic can send an
invalid size for a packet which will trigger a buffer overflow.
