Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite
component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and
12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and
integrity via unknown vectors related to Test Manager for Web Apps, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0490.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in
the process method in the ActionServlet servlet, which allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication via directory traversal sequences
following an unspecified URI string.
