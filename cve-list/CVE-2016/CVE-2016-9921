Quick emulator (Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator
support is vulnerable to a divide by zero issue. It could occur while
copying VGA data when cirrus graphics mode was set to be VGA. A
privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu
process instance on the host, resulting in DoS.
