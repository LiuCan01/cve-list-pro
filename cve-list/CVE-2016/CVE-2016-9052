An exploitable stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the
querying functionality of Aerospike Database Server 3.10.0.3. A
specially crafted packet can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in
the function as_sindex__simatch_by_iname resulting in remote code
execution. An attacker can simply connect to the port to trigger this
vulnerability.
