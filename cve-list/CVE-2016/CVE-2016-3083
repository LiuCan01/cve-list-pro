Apache Hive (JDBC + HiveServer2) implements SSL for plain TCP and HTTP
connections (it supports both transport modes). While validating the
server's certificate during the connection setup, the client in Apache
Hive before 1.2.2 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 doesn't seem to be verifying
the common name attribute of the certificate. In this way, if a JDBC
client sends an SSL request to server abc.com, and the server responds
with a valid certificate (certified by CA) but issued to xyz.com, the
client will accept that as a valid certificate and the SSL handshake
will go through.
