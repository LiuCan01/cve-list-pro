An issue was discovered in Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) Alaris
8015 Point of Care (PC) unit, Version 9.5 and prior versions, and
Version 9.7, and 8000 PC unit. An unauthorized user with physical
access to an affected Alaris PC unit may be able to obtain unencrypted
wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive
technical data by disassembling the PC unit and accessing the device's
flash memory. The Alaris 8015 PC unit, Version 9.7, and the 8000 PC
unit store wireless network authentication credentials and other
sensitive technical data on internal flash memory. Accessing the
internal flash memory of the affected device would require special
tools to extract data and carrying out this attack at a healthcare
facility would increase the likelihood of detection.
