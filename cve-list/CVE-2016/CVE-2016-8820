All versions of NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contain a
vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for
DxgDdiEscape where a check on a function return value is missing,
potentially allowing an uninitialized value to be used as the source
of a strcpy() call, leading to denial of service or information
disclosure.
