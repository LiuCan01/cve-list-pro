SkPath.cpp in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on
Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, does not properly
validate the return values of ChopMonoAtY calls, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access
and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
crafted graphics data.
