The imagegammacorrect function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and
7.x before 7.0.10 does not properly validate gamma values, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
write) or possibly have unspecified other impact by providing
different signs for the second and third arguments.
