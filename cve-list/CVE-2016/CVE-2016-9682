The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is
vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities in its web
administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the
diagnostics CGI (/cgi-bin/diagnostics) component responsible for
emailing out information about the state of the system. The application
doesn't properly escape the information passed in the
'tsrDeleteRestartedFile' or 'currentTSREmailTo' variables before making
a call to system(), allowing for remote command injection. Exploitation
of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under
the nobody user account.
