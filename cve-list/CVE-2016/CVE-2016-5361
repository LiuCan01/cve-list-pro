programs/pluto/ikev1.c in libreswan before 3.17 retransmits in
initial-responder states, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed UDP packet.
NOTE: the original behavior complies with the IKEv1 protocol, but has
a required security update from the libreswan vendor; as of
2016-06-10, it is expected that several other IKEv1 implementations
will have vendor-required security updates, with separate CVE IDs
assigned to each.
