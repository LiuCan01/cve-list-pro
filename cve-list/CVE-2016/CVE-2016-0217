IBM Cognos Business Intelligence and IBM Cognos Analytics are
vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, caused by improper
validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit
this vulnerability to inject malicious script into a Web page which
would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security
context of the hosting Web site, once the page is viewed. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based
authentication credentials.
