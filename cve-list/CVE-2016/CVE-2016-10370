An issue was discovered on OnePlus devices such as the 3T. The OnePlus
OTA Updater pushes the signed-OTA image over HTTP without TLS. While it
does not allow for installation of arbitrary OTAs (due to the digital
signature), it unnecessarily increases the attack surface, and allows
for remote exploitation of other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-5948,
CVE-2017-8850, and CVE-2017-8851.
