IBM Connections is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by
improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could
exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute
script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the
hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication
credentials.
