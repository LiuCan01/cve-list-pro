In /framework/modules/ecommerce/controllers/orderController.php of
Exponent CMS 2.4.0, untrusted input is passed into selectObjectsBySql.
The method selectObjectsBySql of class mysqli_database uses the
injectProof method to prevent SQL injection, but this filter can be
bypassed easily: it only sanitizes user input if there are odd numbers
of ' or " characters. Impact is Information Disclosure.
