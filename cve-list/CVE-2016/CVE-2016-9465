Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2
suffer from Stored XSS in CardDAV image export. The CardDAV image
export functionality as implemented in Nextcloud/ownCloud allows the
download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any
kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored
Cross-Site Scripting attack.
