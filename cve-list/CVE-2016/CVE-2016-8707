An exploitable out of bounds write exists in the handling of
compressed TIFF images in ImageMagicks's convert utility. A crafted
TIFF document can lead to an out of bounds write which in particular
circumstances could be leveraged into remote code execution. The
vulnerability can be triggered through any user controlled TIFF that
is handled by this functionality.
