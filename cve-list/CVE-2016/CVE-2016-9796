Alcatel-Lucent OmniVista 8770 2.0 through 3.0 exposes different ORBs
interfaces, which can be queried using the GIOP protocol on TCP port
30024. An attacker can bypass authentication, and OmniVista invokes
methods (AddJobSet, AddJob, and ExecuteNow) that can be used to run
arbitrary commands on the server, with the privilege of NT
AUTHORITYSYSTEM on the server. NOTE: The discoverer states "The vendor
position is to refer to the technical guidelines of the product
security deployment to mitigate this issue, which means applying proper
firewall rules to prevent unauthorised clients to connect to the
OmniVista server."
