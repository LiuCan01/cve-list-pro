WebKit/Source/bindings/modules/v8/V8BindingForModules.cpp in Blink, as
used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.113, does not properly consider
getter side effects during array key conversion, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via crafted Indexed Database (aka
IndexedDB) API calls.
