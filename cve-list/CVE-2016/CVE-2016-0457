Unspecified vulnerability in the Application Mgmt Pack for E-Business
Suite component in Oracle E-Business Suite 12.1 and 12.2 allows remote
attackers to affect confidentiality via vectors related to REST
Framework, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0456.  NOTE: the
previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on third-party claims that this issue is an XML External
Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, conduct server-side
request forgery (SSRF) attacks, or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a
crafted DTD in an XML request to OA_HTML/lcmServiceController.jsp.
