The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is
vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web
administrative interface. This vulnerability occurs in the 'viewcert'
CGI (/cgi-bin/viewcert) component responsible for processing SSL
certificate information. The CGI application doesn't properly escape
the information it's passed in the 'CERT' variable before a call to
system() is performed - allowing for remote command injection.
Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote
machine under the nobody user account.
