Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite
component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and
12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and
integrity via unknown vectors related to Test Manager for Web Apps, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0487.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in
the UploadServlet servlet, which allows remote attackers to upload and
execute arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in a
filename header.
