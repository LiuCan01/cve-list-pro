IBM Campaign is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper
validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit
this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in
a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web
site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication
credentials.
