The high level operating systems (HLOS) was not providing sufficient
memory address information to ensure that secure applications inside
Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) only write to legitimate
memory ranges related to the QSEE secure application's HLOS client.
When secure applications inside Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment
(QSEE) receive memory addresses from a high level operating system
(HLOS) such as Linux Android, those address have previously been
verified as belonging to HLOS memory space rather than QSEE memory
space, but they were not verified to be from HLOS user space rather
than kernel space. This lack of verification could lead to privilege
escalation within the HLOS.
