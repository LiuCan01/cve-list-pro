A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP
connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8,
8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in
the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache
multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be
used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in
information leakage between requests including, not not limited to,
session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x
onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for
8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially
it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but
further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all
currently supported Tomcat versions.
