W3Mail 1.0.2 through 1.0.5 with server side scripting (SSI) enabled in
the attachments directory does not properly restrict the types of
files that can be uploaded as attachments, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending code in MIME
attachments, then requesting the attachments.
