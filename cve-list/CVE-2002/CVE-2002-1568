OpenSSL 0.9.6e uses assertions when detecting buffer overflow attacks
instead of less severe mechanisms, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via certain messages that cause
OpenSSL to abort from a failed assertion, as demonstrated using SSLv2
CLIENT_MASTER_KEY messages, which are not properly handled in
s2_srvr.c.
