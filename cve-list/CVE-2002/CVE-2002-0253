PHP, when not configured with the "display_errors = Off" setting in
php.ini, allows remote attackers to obtain the physical path for an
include file via a trailing slash in a request to a directly
accessible PHP program, which modifies the base path, causes the
include directive to fail, and produces an error message that contains
the path.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(1) Frech
   NOOP(6) Armstrong, Christey, Cole, Cox, Foat, Wall

Voter Comments:
 Christey> Is this another case when PHP leaks path information by design,
   as supported by "display_errors" option?  Then the
   vulnerability (rather, exposure) would be in the use of the 
   display_errors option itself, whose implications may include
   this particular scenario.
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
