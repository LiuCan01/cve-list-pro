Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) 1.1.14 through 1.1.17 does not
properly check the return values of various file and socket
operations, which could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of
service (resource exhaustion) by causing file descriptors to be
assigned and not released, as demonstrated by fanta.
