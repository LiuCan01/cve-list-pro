The Compressed Folders feature in Microsoft Windows 98 with Plus!
Pack, Windows Me, and Windows XP does not properly check the
destination folder during the decompression of ZIP files, which allows
attackers to place an executable file in a known location on a user's
system, aka "Incorrect Target Path for Zipped File Decompression."
