The DNS resolver in unspecified versions of Infoblox DNS One, when
resolving recursive DNS queries for arbitrary hosts, allows remote
attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning via a birthday attack that
uses a large number of open queries for the same resource record (RR)
combined with spoofed responses, which increases the possibility of
successfully spoofing a response in a way that is more efficient than
brute force methods.
