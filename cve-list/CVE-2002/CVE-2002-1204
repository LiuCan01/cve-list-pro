Netscape Communicator 4.x allows attackers to use a link to steal a
user's preferences, including potentially sensitive information such
as URL history, e-mail address, and possibly the e-mail password, by
redefining the user_pref() function and accessing the prefs.js file,
which is stored in a directory with a predictable name.
