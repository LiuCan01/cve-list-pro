The JavaScript implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 4.0,
Thunderbird before 3.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.1 does not properly
restrict the set of values contained in the object returned by the
getComputedStyle method, which allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information about visited web pages by calling this method.
