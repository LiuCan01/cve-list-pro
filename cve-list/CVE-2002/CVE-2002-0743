Voter Comments:
 Bollinger> IY29516 is the AIX 4.3 APAR for a variety of buffer
   overflows in mail and mailx found during internal testing.  (AIX 5.1
   APAR IY28170 needs to be added to the References.)  I don't know if
   this is similar to CVE-2002-0041 or not due to the vague description
   in the associated advisory.  One of the overflows fixed is similar to
   CVE-2001-0565, but CVE-2000-0545 does not apply here.
