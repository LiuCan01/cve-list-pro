EMC NetWorker (formerly Legato NetWorker) before 7.0 stores log files
in the /nsr/logs/ directory with world-readable permissions, which
allows local users to read sensitive information and possibly gain
privileges.  NOTE: this was originally reported for Legato NetWorker
6.1 on the Solaris 7 platform.
