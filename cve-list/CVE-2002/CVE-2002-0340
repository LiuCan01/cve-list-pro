Reference: BUGTRAQ:20020222 Windows Media Player executes WMF content in .MP3 files.
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=101447771102582&w=2

Windows Media Player (WMP) 8.00.00.4477, and possibly other versions,
automatically detects and executes .wmf and other content, even when
the file's extension or content type does not specify .wmf, which
could make it easier for attackers to conduct unauthorized activities
via Trojan horse files containing .wmf content.
