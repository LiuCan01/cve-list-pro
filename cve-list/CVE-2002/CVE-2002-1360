Multiple SSH2 servers and clients do not properly handle strings with
null characters in them when the string length is specified by a
length field, which could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or possibly execute arbitrary code due to interactions with
the use of null-terminated strings as implemented using languages such
as C, as demonstrated by the SSHredder SSH protocol test suite.
