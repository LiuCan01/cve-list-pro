The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) implementation in Mozilla Firefox
before 4.0, Thunderbird before 3.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.1 does not
properly handle the :visited pseudo-class, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information about visited web pages via
a crafted HTML document, a related issue to CVE-2010-2264.
