An undocumented extension for the Servlet mappings in the Servlet 2.3
specification, when upgrading to WebLogic Server and Express 7.0
Service Pack 1 from BEA WebLogic Server and Express 6.0 through
7.0.0.1, does not prepend a "/" character in certain URL patterns,
which prevents the proper enforcement of role mappings and policies in
applications that use the extension.
