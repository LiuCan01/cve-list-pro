Nortel Alteon ACEdirector WebOS 9.0, with the Server Load Balancing
(SLB) and Cookie-Based Persistence features enabled, allows remote
attackers to determine the real IP address of a web server with a
half-closed session, which causes ACEdirector to send packets from the
server without changing the address to the virtual IP address.
