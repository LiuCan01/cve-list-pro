** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2002-1367.  Reason:
This CAN was originally assigned for the theft of root certificates in
CUPS, but it was later deemed to be a legitimate result of exploiting
a different vulnerability, CVE-2002-1367, so it is not a distinct
vulnerability.  Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2002-1367
instead of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this
candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage.
