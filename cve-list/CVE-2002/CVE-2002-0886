Cisco DSL CPE devices running CBOS 2.4.4 and earlier allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (hang or memory consumption)
via (1) a large packet to the DHCP port, (2) a large packet to the
Telnet port, or (3) a flood of large packets to the CPE, which causes
the TCP/IP stack to consume large amounts of memory.

Voter Comments:
 Jones> A single large packet DoS to a listening service (which sounds
   like a buffer overflow) seems like a different vulnerability than multiple
   large packets (which is admittedly resource consumption).  Suggest SPLIT
   into two items, prolems 1 and 2 in A, and problem 3 in B.
