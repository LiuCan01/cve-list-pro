** DISPUTED **
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.
Symantec Norton AntiVirus (NAV) 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass
the initial virus scan and cause NAV to prematurely stop scanning by
using a non-RFC compliant MIME header.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed
this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but the
AutoProtect feature would detect the virus before it is executed.
