RealJukebox 2 1.0.2.340 and 1.0.2.379, and RealOne Player Gold
6.0.10.505, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary script in the
Local computer zone by inserting the script into the skin.ini file of
an RJS archive, then referencing skin.ini from a web page after it has
been extracted, which is parsed as HTML by Internet Explorer or other
Microsoft-based web readers.
