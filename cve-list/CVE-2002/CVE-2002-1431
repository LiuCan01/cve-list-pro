Belkin F5D5230-4 4-Port Cable/DSL Gateway Router 1.20.000 modifies the
source IP address of internal packets to that of the router's external
interface when forwarding a request from an internal host to an
internal web server, which allows remote attackers to hide which host
is being used to access the web server.
