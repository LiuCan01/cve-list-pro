The Microsoft Java implementation, as used in Internet Explorer, can
provide HTML object references to applets via Javascript, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash due to illegal
memory accesses) and possibly conduct other unauthorized activities
via an applet that uses those references to access proprietary
Microsoft methods.
