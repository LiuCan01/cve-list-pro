Buffer overflow in Pico Server (pServ) 2.0 beta 1 through beta 5
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a 1024-byte TCP stream
message, which triggers an off-by-one buffer overflow, or (2) a long
method name in an HTTP request, (3) a long version number in an HTTP
request, (4) a long User-Agent header, or (5) a long file path.
