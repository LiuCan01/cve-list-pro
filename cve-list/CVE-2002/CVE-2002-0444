Microsoft Windows 2000 running the Terminal Server 90-day trial
version, and possibly other versions, does not apply group policies to
incoming users when the number of connections to the SYSVOL share
exceeds the maximum, e.g. with a maximum number of licenses, which can
allow remote authenticated users to bypass group policies.
