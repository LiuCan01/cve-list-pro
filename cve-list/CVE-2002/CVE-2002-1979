WatchGuard SOHO products running firmware 5.1.6 and earlier, and
Vclass/RSSA using 3.2 SP1 and earlier, allows remote attackers to
bypass firewall rules by sending a PASV command string as the argument
of another command to an FTP server, which generates a response that
contains the string, causing IPFilter to treat the response as if it
were a legitimate PASV command from the server.
