MHonArc 2.5.2 and earlier does not properly filter Javascript from
archived e-mail messages, which could allow remote attackers to
execute script in web clients by (1) splitting the SCRIPT tag into
smaller pieces, (2) including the script in a SRC argument to an IMG
tag, or (3) using "&={script}" syntax.
