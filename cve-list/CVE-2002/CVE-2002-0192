Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:ie-content-disposition-variant(9085)
 Christey> Hrmmm... the MS advisory says this is the "Script within
   Cookies Reading Cookies" vulnerability...  This description
   was also used for CVE-2002-0193.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REJECT]
 Christey> This CAN had the wrong description added to it, which made
   it look like a different vulnerability than the one identified
   by Microsoft in MS:MS02-023.  Therefore this CAN should be
   REJECTed.
