Voter Comments:
 Jones> Suggest description adds "...CFXImage 1.6.6 and earlier does not
   filter form input, allowing remote attackers to read...".  Regarding
   abstraction, vote not to SPLIT; agree that vulnerability is lack of input
   filtering.  SPLITting would imply that Cross-site scripting, etc. due to
   same lack of form input filtering would require a new candidate, etc.
