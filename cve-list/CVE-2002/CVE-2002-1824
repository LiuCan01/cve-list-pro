Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0, when handling an expired CA-CERT in a
webserver's certificate chain during a SSL/TLS handshake, does not
prompt the user before searching for and finding a newer certificate,
which may allow attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
NOTE: it is not clear whether this poses a vulnerability.
