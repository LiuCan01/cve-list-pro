The mailconf module in Linuxconf 1.24, and other versions before 1.28,
on Conectiva Linux 6.0 through 8, and possibly other distributions,
generates the Sendmail configuration file (sendmail.cf) in a way that
configures Sendmail to run as an open mail relay, which allows remote
attackers to send Spam email.
