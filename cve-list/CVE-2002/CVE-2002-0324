Greymatter 1.21c and earlier with the Bookmarklet feature enabled
allows remote attackers to read a cleartext password and gain
administrative privileges by guessing the name of a gmrightclick-*.reg
file which contains the administrator name and password in cleartext,
then retrieving the file from the web server before the Greymatter
administrator performs a "Clear And Exit" action.
