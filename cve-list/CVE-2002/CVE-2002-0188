Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6.0 allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via malformed Content-Disposition and
Content-Type header fields that cause the application for the spoofed
file type to pass the file back to the operating system for handling
rather than raise an error message, aka the second variant of the
"Content Disposition" vulnerability.
