IPFilter 3.1.1 through 3.4.28 allows remote attackers to bypass
firewall rules by sending a PASV command string as the argument of
another command to an FTP server, which generates a response that
contains the string, causing IPFilter to treat the response as if it
were a legitimate PASV command from the server.
