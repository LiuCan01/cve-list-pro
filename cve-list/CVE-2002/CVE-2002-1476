Buffer overflow in setlocale in libc on NetBSD 1.4.x through 1.6, and
possibly other operating systems, when called with the LC_ALL
category, allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
user-controlled locale string that has more than 6 elements, which
exceeds the boundaries of the new_categories category array, as
exploitable through programs such as xterm and zsh.
