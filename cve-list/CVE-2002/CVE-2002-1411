Voter Comments:
 Baker> Since the vendor no longer maintains the code, no fix appears available.
   The dpgs.pll file has insufficient filtering to preclude this, so a fix
   should not be too difficult to make and should be straightforward.
   The description should probably reflect that the lax filtering in
   the dpgs.pll file allows form to be posted with the directory traversal
   and null byte data.
