NetScreen ScreenOS 2.8 through 4.0, when forwarding H.323 or
Netmeeting traffic, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (firewall session table consumption) by establishing multiple
half-open H.323 sessions, which are not cleaned up on garbage removal
and do not time out for 36 hours.
