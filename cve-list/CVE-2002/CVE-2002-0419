Information leaks in IIS 4 through 5.1 allow remote attackers to
obtain potentially sensitive information or more easily conduct brute
force attacks via responses from the server in which (2) in certain
configurations, the server IP address is provided as the realm for
Basic authentication, which could reveal real IP addresses that were
obscured by NAT, or (3) when NTLM authentication is used, the NetBIOS
name of the server and its Windows NT domain are revealed in response
to an Authorization request.  NOTE: this entry originally contained a
vector (1) in which the server reveals whether it supports Basic or
NTLM authentication through 401 Access Denied error messages.  CVE has
REJECTED this vector; it is not a vulnerability because the
information is already available through legitimate use, since
authentication cannot proceed without specifying a scheme that is
supported by both the client and the server.
