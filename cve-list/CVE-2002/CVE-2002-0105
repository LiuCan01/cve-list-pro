CDE dtlogin in Caldera UnixWare 7.1.0, and possibly other operating
systems, allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack on
/var/dt/Xerrors since /var/dt is world-writable.

   Note: the advisory sort-of implies that world-write
   permissions were the key problem, so the fact that a symlink
   attack could take place did not necessarily mean that a
   symlink following vulnerability really existed, in the sense
   that symlink attacks don't exist in directories that are
   not writable by other users (well, without those users
   exploiting some *other* vulnerability to allow them to create
   the symlink!)
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> Hmmm... should XF:cde-dt-world-writable(9045) really be added
   here?  ISS may have "split" between the permissions issue
   and the symlink problem.
