The Javascript "Same Origin Policy" (SOP), as implemented in (1)
Netscape, (2) Mozilla, and (3) Internet Explorer, allows a remote web
server to access HTTP and SOAP/XML content from restricted sites by
mapping the malicious server's parent DNS domain name to the
restricted site, loading a page from the restricted site into one
frame, and passing the information to the attacker-controlled frame,
which is allowed because the document.domain of the two frames matches
on the parent domain.
