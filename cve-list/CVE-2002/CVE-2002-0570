The encrypted loop device in Linux kernel 2.4.10 and earlier does not
authenticate the entity that is encrypting data, which allows local
users to modify encrypted data without knowing the key.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Alderson, Cole, Frech
   MODIFY(1) Foat
   NOOP(2) Cox, Wall

Voter Comments:
 Foat> A local user can not modify the data. The user needs to root the box
   first or at least get UNIX permission to write to the encrypted file system.
   This is different than being a local user.
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
