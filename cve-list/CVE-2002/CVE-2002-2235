Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/10701.php

member2.php in vBulletin 2.2.9 and earlier does not properly restrict
the $perpage variable to be an integer, which causes an error message
to be reflected back to the user without quoting, which facilitates
cross-site scripting (XSS) and possibly other attacks.
