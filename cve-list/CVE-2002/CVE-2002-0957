The default configuration of BlackICE Agent 3.1.eal and 3.1.ebh has a
high tcp.maxconnections setting, which could allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of
connections to the BlackICE system that consumes more resources than
intended by the user.
