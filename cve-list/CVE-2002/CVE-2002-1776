** DISPUTED **
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.
Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass virus
protection via a Word Macro virus with a .nch or .dbx extension, which
is automatically recognized and executed as a Microsoft Office
document.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging
that the initial scan is bypassed, but the Office plug-in would detect
the virus before it is executed.
