bzip2 before 1.0.2 in FreeBSD 4.5 and earlier, OpenLinux 3.1 and
3.1.1, and possibly other operating systems, does not use the O_EXCL
flag to create files during decompression and does not warn the user
if an existing file would be overwritten, which could allow attackers
to overwrite files via a bzip2 archive.
