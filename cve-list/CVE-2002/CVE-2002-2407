Certain patches for QNX Neutrino realtime operating system (RTOS)
6.2.0 set insecure permissions for the files (1) /sbin/io-audio by OS
Update Patch A, (2) /bin/shutdown, (3) /sbin/fs-pkg, and (4)
phshutdown by QNX experimental patches, (5) cpim, (6) vpim, (7)
phrelaycfg, and (8) columns, (9) othello, (10) peg, (11) solitaire,
and (12) vpoker in the games pack 2.0.3, which allows local users to
gain privileges by modifying the files before permissions are changed.
