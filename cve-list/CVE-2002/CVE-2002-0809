Bugzilla 2.14 before 2.14.2, and 2.16 before 2.16rc2, does not
properly handle URL-encoded field names that are generated by some
browsers, which could cause certain fields to appear to be unset,
which has the effect of removing group permissions on bugs when
buglist.cgi is provided with the encoded field names.
