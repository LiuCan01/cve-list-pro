The design of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, when using
Aggressive Mode for shared secret authentication, does not encrypt
initiator or responder identities during negotiation, which may allow
remote attackers to determine valid usernames by (1) monitoring
responses before the password is supplied or (2) sniffing, as
originally reported for FireWall-1 SecuRemote.
