Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4729

domesticinstall.exe for nCipher MSCAPI CSP 5.50 and 5.54 does not use
Operator Card Set protected keys when the user requests them but does
not generate the Operator Card Set, which results in a lower
protection level than specified by the user (module protection only).
