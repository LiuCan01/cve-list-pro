Multiple buffer overflows in in.rarpd (ARP server) on Solaris, and
possibly other operating systems including Caldera UnixWare and Open
UNIX, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, possibly via
the functions (1) syserr and (2) error.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Baker, Cole, Frech
   MODIFY(1) Alderson
   NOOP(5) Armstrong, Christey, Cox, Foat, Jones

Voter Comments:
 Jones> Need clarification/verification.
 Alderson> Personally, since this one is not only vague, but extremely vague
   and not even confirmed, I believe it should be lumped with the previous one
   that has been confirmed and is much less vague.
 Christey> Correction: this is a RARP (Reverse Address Resolution
   Protocol) server.
   A colleague of mine with access to Solaris source has noted
   that the affected syslog calls can not be fed user-supplied
   data, at least for Solaris; if so, then this is not a vulnerability.
