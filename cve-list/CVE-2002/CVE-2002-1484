DB4Web server, when configured to use verbose debug messages, allows
remote attackers to use DB4Web as a proxy and attempt TCP connections
to other systems (port scan) via a request for a URL that specifies
the target IP address and port, which produces a connection status in
the resulting error message.

 Baker> The default behavior is the verbose debug messages, so the description should indicate that this is the default configuration.
