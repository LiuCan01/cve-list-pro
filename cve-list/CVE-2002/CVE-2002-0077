Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0 treats objects invoked
on an HTML page with the codebase property as part of Local Computer
zone, which allows remote attackers to invoke executables present on
the local system through objects such as the popup object, aka the
"Local Executable Invocation via Object tag" vulnerability.

 Christey> Consider adding BID:3867
 Christey> According to Microsoft, the fix for this issue also addresses:
   BUGTRAQ:20020227 IE execution of arbitrary commands without Active Scripting or ActiveX (GM#001-IE)
   URL:http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=101496184505815&w=2
   
   Need to add this reference (and/or double-check to make sure
   this is the right issue) and consider modifying the
   description accordingly, though on the surface there
   does not appear to be any close relation, since the
   GreyMagic bug deals with Data Source (DSO)
   for Data Binding with the dataFormatAs attribute set to HTML, then
   using innerHTML for script injection.
