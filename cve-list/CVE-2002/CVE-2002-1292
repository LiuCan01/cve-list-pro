The Microsoft Java virtual machine (VM) build 5.0.3805 and earlier, as
used in Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to extend the
Standard Security Manager (SSM) class
(com.ms.security.StandardSecurityManager) and bypass intended
StandardSecurityManager restrictions by modifying the (1)
deniedDefinitionPackages or (2) deniedAccessPackages settings, causing
a denial of service by adding Java applets to the list of applets that
are prevented from running.
