htcgibin.exe in Lotus Domino server 5.0.9a and earlier allows remote
attackers to determine the physical pathname for the server via
requests that contain certain MS-DOS device names such as com5, such
as (1) a request with a .pl or .java extension, or (2) a request
containing a large number of periods, which causes htcgibin.exe to
leak the pathname in an error message.
