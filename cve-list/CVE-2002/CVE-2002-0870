Reference: CISCO:20020814 Cisco Content Service Switch 11000 Series Web Management Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/arrowpoint-webmgmt-vuln-pub.shtml

The original patch for the Cisco Content Service Switch 11000 Series
authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2001-0622) was incomplete,
which still allows remote attackers to gain additional privileges by
directly requesting the web management URL instead of navigating
through the interface, possibly via a variant of the original attack,
as identified by Cisco bug ID CSCdw08549.
