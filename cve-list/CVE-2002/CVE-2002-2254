The experimental IP packet queuing feature in Netfilter / IPTables in
Linux kernel 2.4 up to 2.4.19 and 2.5 up to 2.5.31, when a privileged
process exits and network traffic is not being queued, may allow a
later process with the same Process ID (PID) to access certain network
traffic that would otherwise be restricted.
