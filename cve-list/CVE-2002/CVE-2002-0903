register.php for WoltLab Burning Board (wbboard) 1.1.1 uses a small
number of random values for the "code" parameter that is provided to
action.php to approve a new registration, along with predictable new
user ID's, which allows remote attackers to hijack new user accounts
via a brute force attack on the new user ID and the code value.
