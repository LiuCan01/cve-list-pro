Apache 2.0 through 2.0.39 on Windows, OS2, and Netware allows remote
attackers to determine the full pathname of the server via (1) a
request for a .var file, which leaks the pathname in the resulting
error message, or (2) via an error message that occurs when a script
(child process) cannot be invoked.
