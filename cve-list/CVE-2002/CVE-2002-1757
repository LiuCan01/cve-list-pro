PHProjekt 2.0 through 3.1 relies on the $PHP_SELF variable for
authentication, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication
for scripts via a request to a .php file with "sms" in the URL, which
is included in the PATH_INFO portion of the $PHP_SELF variable, as
demonstrated using "mail_send.php/sms".
