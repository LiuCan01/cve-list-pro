Voter Comments:
 Christey> This *might* be vendor acknowledgement:
   URL:http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/12082/0/8595354/
   
   However, the person who's credited by the vendor found *TWO*
   authentication-related vulnerabilities at about the same time,
   and the vendor is clearly fixing "a" vulnerability.  So, which
   issue did the vendor fix?  Which issue is the vendor
   acknowledging - CVE-2002-0757 or CVE-2002-0756?
