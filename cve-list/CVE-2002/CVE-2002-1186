Internet Explorer 5.01 through 6.0 does not properly perform security
checks on certain encoded characters within a URL, which allows a
remote attacker to steal potentially sensitive information from a user
by redirecting the user to another site that has that information, aka
"Encoded Characters Information Disclosure."
