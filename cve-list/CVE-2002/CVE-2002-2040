The (1) phrafx and (2) phgrafx-startup programs in QNX realtime
operating system (RTOS) 4.25 and 6.1.0 do not properly drop privileges
before executing the system command, which allows local users to
execute arbitrary commands by modifying the PATH environment variable
to reference a malicious crttrap program.
