Phase: Proposed (20020502)
Category: CF
Reference: BUGTRAQ:20020212 [GSA2002-01] Web browsers ignore the Content-Type header, thus allowing cross-site scripting
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=101363764421623&w=2

Opera, when configured with the "Determine action by MIME type" option
disabled, interprets an object as an HTML document even when its MIME
Content-Type is text/plain, which could allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary script in documents that the user does not expect,
possibly through web applications that use a text/plain type to
prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
