Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and possibly others allows remote
attackers to upload arbitrary file contents when users press a key
corresponding to the JavaScript (1) event.ctrlKey or (2)
event.shiftKey onkeydown event contained in a webpage.  NOTE: it was
reported that the vendor has disputed the severity of this issue.
