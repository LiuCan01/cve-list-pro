BEA WebLogic Server and Express 7.0 and 7.0.0.1, when running Servlets
and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) on more than one server, will remove
the security constraints and roles on all servers for any Servlets or
EJB that are used by an application that is undeployed on one server,
which could allow remote attackers to conduct unauthorized activities
in violation of the intended restrictions.
