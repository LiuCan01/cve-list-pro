Cisco 2611 router running IOS 12.1(6.5), possibly an interim release,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via port scans
such as (1) scanning all ports on a single host and (2) scanning a
network of hosts for a single open port through the router.  NOTE: the
vendor could not reproduce this issue, saying that the original
reporter was using an interim release of the software.
