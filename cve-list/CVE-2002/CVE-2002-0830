Network File System (NFS) in FreeBSD 4.6.1 RELEASE-p7 and earlier,
NetBSD 1.5.3 and earlier, and possibly other operating systems, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang) via an RPC
message with a zero length payload, which causes NFS to reference a
previous payload and enter an infinite loop.
