** DISPUTED **
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.
Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2002 allows remote attackers to send viruses
that bypass the e-mail scanning via a NULL character in the MIME
header before the virus.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue,
acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but the AutoProtect
feature would detect the virus before it is executed.
