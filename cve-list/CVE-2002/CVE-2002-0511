The default configuration of Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd) in
Caldera OpenLinux 3.1 and 3.1.1 uses cached PTR records instead of
consulting the authoritative DNS server for the A record, which could
make it easier for remote attackers to bypass applications that
restrict access based on host names.
