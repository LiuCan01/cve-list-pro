InterScan VirusWall 3.52 build 1462 allows remote attackers to bypass
virus protection via e-mail messages with headers that violate RFC
specifications by having (or missing) space characters in unexpected
places (aka "space gap"), such as (1) Content-Type :", (2)
"Content-Transfer-Encoding :", (3) no space before a boundary
declaration, or (4) "boundary= ", which is processed by Outlook
Express.

   According to Axel Pettinger, Solaris 3.7 build 1070
   is affected by the "boundary space (trailing)" and "Boundary
   Space (prefix)" problems, but not the content-type or transfer
   encoding issues.  That version clearly has some overlap with
   this issue, but since a different build and version number are
   affected, perhaps a separate candidate needs to be created.
