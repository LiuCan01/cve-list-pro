Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) 1.1.14 through 1.1.17 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code by causing negative arguments to be fed into memcpy()
calls via HTTP requests with (1) a negative Content-Length value or
(2) a negative length in a chunked transfer encoding.
