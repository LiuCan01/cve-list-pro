In Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000, a trusting domain that
receives authorization information from a trusted domain does not
verify that the trusted domain is authoritative for all listed SIDs,
which allows remote attackers to gain Domain Administrator privileges
on the trusting domain by injecting SIDs from untrusted domains into
the authorization data that comes from from the trusted domain.
