ISS RealSecure for Nokia devices before IPSO build 6.0.2001.141d is
configured to allow a user "skank" on a machine "starscream" to become
a key manager when the "first time connection" feature is enabled and
before any legitimate administrators have connected, which could allow
remote attackers to gain access to the device during installation.
