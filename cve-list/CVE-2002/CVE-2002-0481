An interaction between Windows Media Player (WMP) and Outlook 2002
allows remote attackers to bypass Outlook security settings and
execute Javascript via an IFRAME in an HTML email message that
references .WMS (Windows Media Skin) or other WMP media files, whose
onload handlers execute the player.LaunchURL() Javascript function.
