Voter Comments:
 Foat> Replace the word "Unknown" with "A" and change "allow" to "allows".
 Christey> The "Unknown" portion of the vulnerability statement is used
   to emphasize that the vendor has not provided sufficient
   information to understand the cause or nature of the problem.
   This is important because this vagueness makes it difficult
   or impossible to resolve it with vulnerability reports
   from other sources, increasing the risk of duplication.
   
   Most candidates affected by CD:VAGUE will use this description
   style.
