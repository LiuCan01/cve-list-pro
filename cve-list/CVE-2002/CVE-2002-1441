Multiple buffer overflows in Tomahawk SteelArrow before 4.5 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the Steelarrow
Service (Steelarrow.exe) using a long UserIdent Cookie header, (2)
DLLHOST.EXE (Steelarrow.dll) via a request for a long .aro file, or
(3) DLLHOST.EXE via a Chunked Transfer-Encoding request.
