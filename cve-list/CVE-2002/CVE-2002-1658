Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 1.3.26 and 1.3.27 may allow
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long user argument.  NOTE:
since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or
setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation
of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program.
Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
