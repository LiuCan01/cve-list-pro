Format string vulnerability in artsd, when called by artswrapper,
allows local users to gain privileges via format strings in the -a
argument, which results in an error message that is not properly
handled in a call to the arts_fatal function.

Voter Comments:
 Foat> Artsd was supposedly vulnerable to a format string vulneraibity
   resulting in elevated privileges because it called command (artscontrol) and was
   installed suid root. The problem was supposed to affect Red Hat 7.2. We looked
   at two different install of 7.2, neither of which had artsd nor artscontrol
   installed suid root.
