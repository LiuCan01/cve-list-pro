(1) Webmin 0.96 and (2) Usermin 0.90 with password timeouts enabled
allow local and possibly remote attackers to bypass authentication and
gain privileges via certain control characters in the authentication
information, which can force Webmin or Usermin to accept arbitrary
username/session ID combinations.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> This *might* be vendor acknowledgement:
   URL:http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/12082/0/8595354/
   
   However, the person who's credited by the vendor found *TWO*
   authentication-related vulnerabilities at about the same time,
   and the vendor is clearly fixing "a" vulnerability.  So, which
   issue did the vendor fix?  Which issue is the vendor
   acknowledging - CVE-2002-0757 or CVE-2002-0756?
