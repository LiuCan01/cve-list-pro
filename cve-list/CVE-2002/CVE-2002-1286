The Microsoft Java implementation, as used in Internet Explorer,
allows remote attackers to steal cookies and execute script in a
different security context via a URL that contains a colon in the
domain portion, which is not properly parsed and loads an applet from
a malicious site within the security context of the site that is being
visited by the user.
