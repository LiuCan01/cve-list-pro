** DISPUTED **
NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.
Symantec Norton AntiVirus (NAV) 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass
e-mail scanning via a filename in the Content-Type field with an
excluded extension such as .nch or .dbx, but a malicious extension in
the Content-Disposition field, which is used by Outlook to obtain the
file name.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging
that the initial scan is bypassed, but Norton AntiVirus or the Office
plug-in would detect the virus before it is executed.
