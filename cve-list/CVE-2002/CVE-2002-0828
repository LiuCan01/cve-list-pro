 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REJECT]
 Christey> This is an original report of a larger issue as described in
   CVE-2002-0862.  This candidate will be REJECTED and
   CVE-2002-0862 will be used in its place, since CVE-2002-0862
   comes from a more authoritative source, and is more accurate.
 Foat> This vulneraiblity is valid. It was discovered that the scope is much
   greater than indicated in the description, since certificate checking is an OS
   function in the Windows environment. A complete listing of the vulnerable
   platforms is available at
   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bull
   etin/ms02-050.asp.
