The Google toolbar 1.1.58 and earlier allows remote web sites to
perform unauthorized toolbar operations including script execution and
file reading in other zones such as "My Computer" by opening a window
to tools.google.com or the res: protocol, then using script to modify
the window's location to the toolbar's configuration URL, which
bypasses the origin verification check.
