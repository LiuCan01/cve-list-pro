Race condition in bzip2 before 1.0.2 in FreeBSD 4.5 and earlier,
OpenLinux 3.1 and 3.1.1, and possibly other operating systems,
decompresses files with world-readable permissions before setting the
permissions to what is specified in the bzip2 archive, which could
allow local users to read the files as they are being decompressed.
