Yet Another Bulletin Board (YaBB) 1.40 and 1.41 does not require a
user to submit the correct password before changing it to a new
password, which allows remote attackers to modify passwords by
stealing the cookie of another user, modifying the expiretime setting,
and submitting the change in a profile2 action to index.php.
