Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Bytecode Verifier allows remote
attackers to escape the Java sandbox and execute commands via an
applet containing an illegal cast operation, as seen in (1) Microsoft
VM build 3802 and earlier as used in Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x,
(2) Netscape 6.2.1 and earlier, and possibly other implementations
that use vulnerable versions of SDK or JDK, aka a variant of the
"Virtual Machine Verifier" vulnerability.
