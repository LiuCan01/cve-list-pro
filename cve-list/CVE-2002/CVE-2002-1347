Multiple buffer overflows in Cyrus SASL library 2.1.9 and earlier
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
execute arbitrary code via (1) long inputs during user name
canonicalization, (2) characters that need to be escaped during LDAP
authentication using saslauthd, or (3) an off-by-one error in the log
writer, which does not allocate space for the null character that
terminates a string.
