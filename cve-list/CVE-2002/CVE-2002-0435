Race condition in the recursive (1) directory deletion and (2)
directory move in GNU File Utilities (fileutils) 4.1 and earlier
allows local users to delete directories as the user running fileutils
by moving a low-level directory to a higher level as it is being
deleted, which causes fileutils to chdir to a ".." directory that is
higher than expected, possibly up to the root file system.
