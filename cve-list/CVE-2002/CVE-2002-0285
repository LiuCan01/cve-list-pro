Outlook Express 5.5 and 6.0 on Windows treats a carriage return ("CR")
in a message header as if it were a valid carriage return/line feed
combination (CR/LF), which could allow remote attackers to bypass
virus protection and or other filtering mechanisms via a mail message
with headers that only contain the CR, which causes Outlook to create
separate headers.
