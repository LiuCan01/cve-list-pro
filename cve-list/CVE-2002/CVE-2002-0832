Voter Comments:
 Foat> This is more an exposure than a vulnerability. IE does have, as the
   autho0r contends, a "user data persistence" feature that is independent of the
   settings used to control cookies. Microsoft allows a user to turn off the
   feature via a simple setting. Bottom line, this is a configuration problem.
