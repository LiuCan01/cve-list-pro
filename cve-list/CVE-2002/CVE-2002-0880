Voter Comments:
 Jones> Suggest description removes tool references: "Cisco IP Phone
   (VoIP) models 7910, 7940, and 7960 allow remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a flood of malformed IP
   packets."  The tools are just generators of specific malformed packets and
   don't actually represent vulnerabilities; the vulnerability is in the
   ability of the Cisco device IP stack to handle various malformed packets.
   Cisco description indicates that the solution was to improve the devices'
   ability to handle high rates of traffic (not to repair specific packet
   handling code in the stack).  This suggests a single CVE entry (vice
   multiple entries if the stack had a set of different vulnerabilities).
 Baker> I agree the description should be changed to describe the problem as failure to handle malformed IP packets
 Frech> XF:cisco-ipphone-multiple-dos(9145)
