 Cox> LPRng does not contain anything called runlpr, and in fact if you
   look at the packages SuSE say that they ship as part of the erratum they
   don't even provide updated LPRng packages.  However they do ship lprfilter
   packages and looking inside them I find that they are what contain this 
   runlpr program:
   
   http://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/suse.com/i386/update/8.0/ap1/lpdfilter-0.42-155.i386.html
   
   This states that lpdfilter is a collection of scripts written by SuSE, and
   the changelog even highlights this is where the security fix was made.
   Therefore I believe that the CVE reference and all the descriptions of
   this vulnerability, which are based on a bad advisory description from
   SuSE, are also wrong, it should be:
   
   "runlpr from the SuSE lpdfilter package allows the local lp user to gain
   root privileges via certain command line arguments."
