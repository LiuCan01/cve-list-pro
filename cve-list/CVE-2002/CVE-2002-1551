Voter Comments:
 Bollinger> IY34670 did not have a complete fix for this vulnerability.
   The complete fix is found in IY40519.  In addition, nslookup
   completely drops privileges very early in the process.  This buffer
   overflow would not result in privilege increase.
 Christey> If this overflow doesn't cross privilege boundaries, then it's
   not security relevant and should be excluded from CVE.
