Vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows remote
malicious web sites to hijack or sniff a web client's sessions, when
an HTTP proxy is being used, via a Java applet that redirects the
session to another server, as seen in (1) Netscape 6.0 through 6.1 and
4.79 and earlier, (2) Microsoft VM build 3802 and earlier as used in
Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x, and possibly other implementations that
use vulnerable versions of SDK or JDK.
