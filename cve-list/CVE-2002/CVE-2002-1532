The administrative web interface (STEMWADM) for SurfControl SuperScout
Email Filter allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(resource exhaustion) via a GET request without the terminating
/r/n/r/n (CRLF) sequence, which causes the interface to wait for the
sequence and blocks other users from accessing it.
