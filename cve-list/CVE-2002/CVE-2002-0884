Multiple format string vulnerabilities in in.rarpd (ARP server) on
Solaris, Caldera UnixWare and Open UNIX, and possibly other operating
systems, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format
strings that are not properly handled in the functions (1) syserr and
(2) error.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(5) Alderson, Armstrong, Baker, Cole, Frech
   MODIFY(1) Jones
   NOOP(3) Christey, Cox, Foat

Voter Comments:
 Jones> Suggest description: "...allows remote attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via the functions (1) syserr and
   (2) error."
 Christey> Correction: this is a RARP (Reverse Address Resolution
   Protocol) server.
   
   A colleague of mine with access to Solaris source has noted
   that the affected syslog calls can not be fed user-supplied
   data, at least for Solaris; if so, then this is not a vulnerability.
 Baker> I think you leave the description as it specifies how the attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands.
