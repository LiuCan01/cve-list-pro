Reference: BUGTRAQ:20020212 [GSA2002-01] Web browsers ignore the Content-Type header, thus allowing cross-site scripting
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=101363764421623&w=2

Internet Explorer 5.x and 6 interprets an object as an HTML document
even when its MIME Content-Type is text/plain, which could allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary script in documents that the
user does not expect, possibly through web applications that use a
text/plain type to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
