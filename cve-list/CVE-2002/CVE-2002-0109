Linksys EtherFast BEFN2PS4, BEFSR41, and BEFSR81 Routers, and possibly
other products, allow remote attackers to gain sensitive information
and cause a denial of service via an SNMP query for the default
community string "public," which causes the router to change its
configuration and send SNMP trap information back to the system that
initiated the query.
