The LAN-to-LAN IPSEC capability for Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator 2.2.x,
and 3.x before 3.5.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service via an incoming LAN-to-LAN connection with an existing
security association with another device on the remote network, which
causes the concentrator to remove the previous connection.
