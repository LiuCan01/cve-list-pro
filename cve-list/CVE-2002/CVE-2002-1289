The Microsoft Java implementation, as used in Internet Explorer,
allows remote attackers to read restricted process memory, cause a
denial of service (crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code via the
getNativeServices function, which creates an instance of the
com.ms.awt.peer.INativeServices (INativeServices) class, whose methods
do not verify the memory addresses that are passed as parameters.
