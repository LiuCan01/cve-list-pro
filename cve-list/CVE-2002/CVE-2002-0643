The installation of Microsoft Data Engine 1.0 (MSDE 1.0), and
Microsoft SQL Server 2000 creates setup.iss files with insecure
permissions and does not delete them after installation, which allows
local users to obtain sensitive data, including weakly encrypted
passwords, to gain privileges, aka "SQL Server Installation Process
May Leave Passwords on System."
