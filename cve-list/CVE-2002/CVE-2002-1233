A regression error in the Debian distributions of the apache-ssl
package (before 1.3.9 on Debian 2.2, and before 1.3.26 on Debian 3.0),
for Apache 1.3.27 and earlier, allows local users to read or modify
the Apache password file via a symlink attack on temporary files when
the administrator runs (1) htpasswd or (2) htdigest, a re-introduction
of a vulnerability that was originally identified and addressed by
CVE-2001-0131.

Voter Comments:
 Cox> Many vendors have included fixes for CVE-2001-0131 in their distributions
   of Apache even though this has not been fixed upstream.  I still believe
   that this is not worthy of a separate CVE name since this is just Debian
   forgetting to include their fix for CVE-2001-0131 in one of their versions,
   and then correcting it.
