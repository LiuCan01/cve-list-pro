Voter Comments:
 Baker> There is an updated version available from the vendor's website,
   http://www.51webmail.com/downloadwem.html
   however, I am unable to determine whether this bug has been fixed or
   not, since the site is in Chinese.  There is no english language version
   of it, apparently.  There is an upgrade notes and patch listing under the
   download menu, so if we have someone with chinese language skills, we might
   be able to get this one sorted out...
