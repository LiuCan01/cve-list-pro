Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/9269.php

Buffer overflow in PFinger 0.7.8 client allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a long query value passed to the (1) finger
program, (2) -l, (3) -d, and (4) -t options.  NOTE: if PFinger is not
setuid or setgid, then this issue would not cross privilege boundaries
and would not be considered a vulnerability.
