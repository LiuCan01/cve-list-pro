BIND 4 and BIND 8, when resolving recursive DNS queries for arbitrary
hosts, allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning via a
birthday attack that uses a large number of open queries for the same
resource record (RR) combined with spoofed responses, which increases
the possibility of successfully spoofing a response in a way that is
more efficient than brute force methods.
