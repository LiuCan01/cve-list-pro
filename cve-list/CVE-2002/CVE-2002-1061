Multiple buffer overflows in Thomas Hauck Jana Server 2.x through
2.2.1, and 1.4.6 and earlier, allow remote attackers to cause a denial
of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) an HTTP GET
request with a long major version number, (2) an HTTP GET request to
the HTTP proxy on port 3128 with a long major version number, (3) a
long OK reply from a POP3 server, and (4) a long SMTP server response.
