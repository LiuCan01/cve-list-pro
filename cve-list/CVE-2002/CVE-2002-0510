The UDP implementation in Linux 2.4.x kernels keeps the IP
Identification field at 0 for all non-fragmented packets, which could
allow remote attackers to determine that a target system is running
Linux.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Foat, Frech, Green
   NOOP(3) Cole, Cox, Wall

Voter Comments:
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
 Cox> So I asked some kernel guys about this - it's not considered
   an issue.  There are several other ways to identify Linux on
   the wire and people who care about this kind of thing rewrite
   their packets in various ways via firewall technology to trick
   the identifier programs.
