Quassel core (server daemon) in Quassel IRC before 0.9.2 does not
properly verify the user ID when accessing user backlogs, which allows
remote authenticated users to read other users' backlogs via the
bufferid in (1) 16/select_buffer_by_id.sql, (2)
16/select_buffer_by_id.sql, and (3) 16/select_buffer_by_id.sql in
core/SQL/PostgreSQL/.
