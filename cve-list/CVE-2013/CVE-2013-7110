Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42

Transifex command-line client before 0.10 does not validate X.509
certificates for data transfer connections, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a Transifex server via an
arbitrary certificate.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2073.
