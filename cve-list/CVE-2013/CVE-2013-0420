Unspecified vulnerability in the VirtualBox component in Oracle
Virtualization 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 allows local users to affect
integrity and availability via unknown vectors related to Core.  NOTE:
The previous information was obtained from the January 2013 Oracle
CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this
issue is related to an incorrect comparison in the vga_draw_text
function in Devices/Graphics/DevVGA.cpp, which can cause VirtualBox to
"draw more lines than necessary."
