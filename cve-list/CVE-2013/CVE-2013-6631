Use-after-free vulnerability in the Channel::SendRTCPPacket function
in voice_engine/channel.cc in libjingle in WebRTC, as used in Google
Chrome before 31.0.1650.48 and other products, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger the absence of
certain statistics initialization, leading to the skipping of a
required DeRegisterExternalTransport call.
