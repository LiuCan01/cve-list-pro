Reference: CONFIRM:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVEs

The CTransaction::FetchInputs method in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before
0.8.0rc1 copies transactions from disk to memory without incrementally
checking for spent prevouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (disk I/O consumption) via a Bitcoin transaction
with many inputs corresponding to many different parts of the stored
block chain.
