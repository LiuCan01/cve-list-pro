The TLS and DTLS implementations in wolfSSL CyaSSL before 2.5.0 do not
properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC
check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which
allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and
plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for
crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
