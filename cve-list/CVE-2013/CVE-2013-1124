Reference: CISCO:20130227 Cisco Network Admission Control Mac Agent Connects to ISE Server with Untrusted SSL Certificate
Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2013-1124

The Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) agent on Mac OS X does not
verify the X.509 certificate of an Identity Services Engine (ISE)
server during an SSL session, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
to spoof ISE servers via an arbitrary certificate, aka Bug ID
CSCub24309.
