The Windows Forms (aka WinForms) component in Microsoft .NET Framework
1.0 SP3, 1.1 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2, 4, and 4.5 does not properly
initialize memory arrays, which allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information via (1) a crafted XAML browser application
(XBAP) or (2) a crafted .NET Framework application that leverages a
pointer to an unmanaged memory location, aka "System Drawing
Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
