** DISPUTED ** The IsHandleEntrySecure function in win32k.sys in the
kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 SP2 does not
properly validate the tagPROCESSINFO pW32Job field, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
system crash) via a crafted NtUserValidateHandleSecure call for an
owned object.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the significance of
this report, stating that "it appears to be a local DOS ... we don't
consider it a security vulnerability."
