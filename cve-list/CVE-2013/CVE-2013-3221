The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and
3.2.x does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column
is used during comparisons of input values to stored values in that
column, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails applications via a
crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction between the
"typed XML" feature and a MySQL database.
