ajax.functions.php in the MailUp plugin before 1.3.3 for WordPress
does not properly restrict access to unspecified Ajax functions, which
allows remote attackers to modify plugin settings and conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by setting the wordpress_logged_in
cookie.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for a similar issue
that was fixed in 1.3.2.
