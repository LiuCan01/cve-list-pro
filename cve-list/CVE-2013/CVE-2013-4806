The OSPF implementation on HP JD9##A routers; HP J4###A, J484#B,
J8###A, JD3##A, JE###A, and JF55#A switches; HP 3COM routers and
switches; and HP H3C routers and switches does not consider the
possibility of duplicate Link State ID values in Link State
Advertisement (LSA) packets before performing operations on the LSA
database, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (routing disruption) or obtain sensitive packet information
via a crafted LSA packet, a related issue to CVE-2013-0149.
