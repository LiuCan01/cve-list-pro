The HTTPSTK service in the novell-nrm package before
2.0.2-297.305.302.3 in Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 (OES 2) Linux,
and OES 11 Linux Gold and SP1, does not make the intended SSL_free and
SSL_shutdown calls for the close of a TCP connection, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service crash) by
establishing many TCP connections to port 8009.
