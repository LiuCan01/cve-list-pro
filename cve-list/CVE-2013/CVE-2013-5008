The agent and task-agent components in Symantec Management Platform
7.0 and 7.1 before 7.1 SP2 Mp1.1v7 rollup, as used in certain Altiris
products, use the same registry-entry encryption key across different
customers' installations, which makes it easier for local users to
obtain sensitive information about package-server access, or cause a
denial of service, by leveraging knowledge of this key.
