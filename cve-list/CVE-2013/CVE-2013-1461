The ExecuteSoapAction function in the SOAPAction handler in the HTTP
service in MiniUPnP MiniUPnPd 1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and service crash) via a
SOAPAction header that lacks a # (pound sign) character, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2013-0230.
