The Flash plug-in in Google Chrome before 27.0.1453.116, as used on
Google Chrome OS before 27.0.1453.116 and separately, does not
properly determine whether a user wishes to permit camera or
microphone access by a Flash application, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information from a machine's physical
environment via a clickjacking attack, as demonstrated by an attack
using a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) opacity property.
