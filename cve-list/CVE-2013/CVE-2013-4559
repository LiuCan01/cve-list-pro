lighttpd before 1.4.33 does not check the return value of the (1)
setuid, (2) setgid, or (3) setgroups functions, which might cause
lighttpd to run as root if it is restarted and allows remote attackers
to gain privileges, as demonstrated by multiple calls to the clone
function that cause setuid to fail when the user process limit is
reached.
