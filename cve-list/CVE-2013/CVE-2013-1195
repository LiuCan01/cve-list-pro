Reference: CISCO:20130422 Time-Range Object Access List Bypass Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2013-1195

The time-based ACL implementation on Cisco Adaptive Security
Appliances (ASA) devices, and in Cisco Firewall Services Module
(FWSM), does not properly handle periodic statements for the
time-range command, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions by sending network traffic during denied time
periods, aka Bug IDs CSCuf79091 and CSCug45850.
