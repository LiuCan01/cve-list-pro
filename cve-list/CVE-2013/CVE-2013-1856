The ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM backend in
lib/active_support/xml_mini/jdom.rb in the Active Support component in
Ruby on Rails 3.0.x and 3.1.x before 3.1.12 and 3.2.x before 3.2.13,
when JRuby is used, does not properly restrict the capabilities of the
XML parser, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or
cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via vectors involving
(1) an external DTD or (2) an external entity declaration in
conjunction with an entity reference.
