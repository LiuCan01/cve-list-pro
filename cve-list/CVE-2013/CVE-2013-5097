Juniper Junos Space before 13.1R1.6, as used on the JA1500 appliance
and in other contexts, does not properly restrict access to the list
of user accounts and their MD5 password hashes, which makes it easier
for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via a
dictionary attack, aka PR 879462.
