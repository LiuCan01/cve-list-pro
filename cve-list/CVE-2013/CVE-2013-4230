The mm_webform submodule in the Monster Menus module 6.x-6.x before
6.x-6.61 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.13 for Drupal does not properly
restrict access to webform submissions, which allows remote
authenticated users with the "Who can read data submitted to this
webform" permission to delete arbitrary submissions via unspecified
vectors.
