Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in OpenStack Compute (Nova)
before 2013.1.3 and Havana before havana-3 does not properly handle
network source security group policy updates, which allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (nova-network
consumption) via a large number of server-creation operations, which
triggers a large number of update requests.
