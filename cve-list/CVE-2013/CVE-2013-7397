Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips
X.509 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a
trustStore location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary
certificate during use of a typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated
by a configuration that does not send client certificates.
