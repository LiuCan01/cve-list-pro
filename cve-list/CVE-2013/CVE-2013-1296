The Remote Desktop ActiveX control in mstscax.dll in Microsoft Remote
Desktop Connection Client 6.1 and 7.0 does not properly handle objects
in memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
a web page that triggers access to a deleted object, and allows remote
RDP servers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that
trigger access to a deleted object, aka "RDP ActiveX Control Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability."
