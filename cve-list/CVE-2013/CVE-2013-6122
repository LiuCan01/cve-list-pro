Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/security-advisories/multiple-memory-corruption-issues-and-race-condition-goodix-gt915-touchscreen-driver-procfs-handler

goodix_tool.c in the Goodix gt915 touchscreen driver for the Linux
kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android
contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not properly
synchronize updates to a global variable, which allows local users to
bypass intended access restrictions or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) via crafted arguments to the procfs write handler.
