The get_xattrinfo function in the XNU kernel in Apple iOS 5.x and 6.x
through 6.1.3 on iPad devices does not properly validate the header of
an AppleDouble file, which might allow local users to cause a denial
of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact via an
invalid file on an msdosfs filesystem.
