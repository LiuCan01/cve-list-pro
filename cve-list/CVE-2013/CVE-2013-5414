The migration functionality in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS)
7.0 before 7.0.0.31, 8.0 before 8.0.0.8, and 8.5 before 8.5.5.1 does
not properly support the distinction between the admin role and the
adminsecmanager role, which allows remote authenticated users to gain
privileges in opportunistic circumstances by accessing resources in
between a migration and a role evaluation.
