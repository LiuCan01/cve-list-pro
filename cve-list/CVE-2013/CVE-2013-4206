Heap-based buffer underflow in the modmul function in sshbn.c in PuTTY
before 0.63 allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption or code execution via a
crafted DSA signature, which is not properly handled when performing
certain bit-shifting operations during modular multiplication.
