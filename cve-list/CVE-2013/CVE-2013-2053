Buffer overflow in the atodn function in Openswan before 2.6.39, when
Opportunistic Encryption is enabled and an RSA key is being used,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (pluto IKE daemon
crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted DNS TXT
records.  NOTE: this might be the same vulnerability as CVE-2013-2052
and CVE-2013-2054.
