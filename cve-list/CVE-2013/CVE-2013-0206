Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the Live CSS module 6.x-2.x
before 6.x-2.1 and 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.7 for Drupal allows remote
authenticated users with the "administer CSS" permissions to execute
arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable extension, then
accessing it via a direct request to the file in an unspecified
directory.
