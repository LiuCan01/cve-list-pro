The Dell iDRAC6 with firmware 1.x before 1.92 and 2.x and 3.x before
3.42, and iDRAC7 with firmware before 1.23.23, allows remote attackers
to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary IPMI commands by using
cipher suite 0 (aka cipher zero) and an arbitrary password.  NOTE: the
vendor disputes the significance of this issue, stating "DRAC's are
intended to be on a separate management network; they are not designed
nor intended to be placed on or connected to the Internet."
