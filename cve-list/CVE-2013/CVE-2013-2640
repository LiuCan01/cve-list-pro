ajax.functions.php in the MailUp plugin before 1.3.2 for WordPress
does not properly restrict access to unspecified Ajax functions, which
allows remote attackers to modify plugin settings and conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via unspecified vectors related to
"formData=save" requests, a different version than CVE-2013-0731.
