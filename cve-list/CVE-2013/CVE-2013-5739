The default configuration of WordPress before 3.6.1 does not prevent
uploads of .swf and .exe files, which might make it easier for remote
authenticated users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
a crafted file, related to the get_allowed_mime_types function in
wp-includes/functions.php.
