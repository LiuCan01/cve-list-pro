The autocomplete callback in Autocomplete Widgets for Text and Number
Fields (autocomplete_widgets) module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.4 and
7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.0-rc1 does not properly handle node permissions,
which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive field
values via unspecified vectors.
