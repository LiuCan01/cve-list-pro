Off-by-one error in the dane_raw_tlsa in the DANE library (libdane) in
GnuTLS 3.1.x before 3.1.16 and 3.2.x before 3.2.6 allows remote
servers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a
response with more than four DANE entries.  NOTE: this issue is due to
an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-4466.
