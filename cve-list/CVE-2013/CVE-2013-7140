XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the CalDAV interface in
Open-Xchange (OX) AppSuite 7.4.1 and earlier allows remote
authenticated users to read portions of arbitrary files via vectors
related to the SAX builder and the WebDAV interface.  NOTE: this issue
has been labeled as both absolute path traversal and XXE, but the root
cause may be XXE, since XXE can be exploited to conduct absolute path
traversal and other attacks.
