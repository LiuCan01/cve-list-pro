The Spring MVC in Spring Framework before 3.2.4 and 4.0.0.M1 through
4.0.0.M2 does not disable external entity resolution for the StAX
XMLInputFactory, which allows context-dependent attackers to read
arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks
via crafted XML with JAXB, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, and
a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4152.  NOTE: this issue was
SPLIT from CVE-2013-4152 due to different affected versions.
