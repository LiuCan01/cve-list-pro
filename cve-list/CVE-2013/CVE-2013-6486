gtkutils.c in Pidgin before 2.10.8 on Windows allows user-assisted
remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs via a message
containing a file: URL that is improperly handled during construction
of an explorer.exe command.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3185.
