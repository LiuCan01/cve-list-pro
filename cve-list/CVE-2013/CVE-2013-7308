The OSPF implementation on the D-Link DES-3810-28 switch with firmware
R2.20.B017 does not consider the possibility of duplicate Link State
ID values in Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets before performing
operations on the LSA database, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (routing disruption) or obtain sensitive packet
information via a crafted LSA packet, a related issue to
CVE-2013-0149.
