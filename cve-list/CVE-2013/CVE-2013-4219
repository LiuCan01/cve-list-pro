Multiple integer overflows in the Intel WiMAX Network Service through
1.5.2 for Intel Wireless WiMAX Connection 2400 devices allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (component crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via an L5 connection with a crafted PDU value
that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow within (1)
L5SocketsDispatcher.c or (2) L5Connector.c.
