Buffer overflow in sshbn.c in PuTTY before 0.63 allows remote SSH
servers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid DSA
signature that is not properly handled during computation of a modular
inverse and triggers the overflow during a division by zero by the
bignum functionality, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4206.
