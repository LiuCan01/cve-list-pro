Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/leonnnn/pyxtrlock/blob/master/CHANGELOG

pyxtrlock before 0.2 does not properly check the return values of the
(1) xcb_grab_pointer and (2) xcb_grab_keyboard XCB library functions,
which allows physically proximate attackers to gain access to the
keyboard or mouse without unlocking the screen via unspecified
vectors.
