The Microsoft.XMLDOM ActiveX control in Microsoft Windows 8.1 and
earlier does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and
CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number
of nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
