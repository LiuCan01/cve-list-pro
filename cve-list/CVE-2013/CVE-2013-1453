plugins/system/highlight/highlight.php in Joomla! 3.0.x through 3.0.2
and 2.5.x through 2.5.8 allows attackers to unserialize arbitrary PHP
objects to obtain sensitive information, delete arbitrary directories,
conduct SQL injection attacks, and possibly have other impacts via the
highlight parameter.  Note: it was originally reported that this issue
only allowed attackers to obtain sensitive information, but later
analysis demonstrated that other attacks exist.
