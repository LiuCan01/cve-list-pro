The jpeg2000_decode_tile function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dec.c in
FFmpeg before 2.1 does not consider the component number in certain
calculations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via crafted JPEG2000 data.
