Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology
component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.3.7 and 8.4 allows
context-dependent attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors
related to Outside In Filters, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2013-0393.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
January 2013 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from an
independent researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow in
the Paradox database stream filter (vspdx.dll) that can be triggered
using a table header with a crafted "number of fields" value.
