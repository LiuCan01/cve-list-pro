The engineNextBytes function in
classlib/modules/security/src/main/java/common/org/apache/harmony/security/provider/crypto/SHA1PRNG_SecureRandomImpl.java
in the SecureRandom implementation in Apache Harmony through 6.0M3, as
used in the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) in Android before 4.4
and other products, when no seed is provided by the user, uses an
incorrect offset value, which makes it easier for attackers to defeat
cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging the resulting PRNG
predictability, as exploited in the wild against Bitcoin wallet
applications in August 2013.
