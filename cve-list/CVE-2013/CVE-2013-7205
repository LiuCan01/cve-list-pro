Off-by-one error in the process_cgivars function in
contrib/daemonchk.c in Nagios Core 3.5.1, 4.0.2, and earlier allows
remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information from
process memory or cause a denial of service (crash) via a long string
in the last key value in the variable list, which triggers a
heap-based buffer over-read.
