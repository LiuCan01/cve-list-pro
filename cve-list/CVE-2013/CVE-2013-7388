Heap-based buffer overflow in paintlib, as used in Trimble SketchUp
(formerly Google SketchUp) before 2013 (13.0.3689), allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RLE4-compressed
bitmap (BMP).  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2013-3664 due to
different affected products and codebases (ADT1).
