The Portable Tool Library (aka PTLib) before 2.10.10, as used in Ekiga
before 4.0.1, does not properly detect recursion during entity
expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted PXML document containing a
large number of nested entity references, aka a "billion laughs
attack."
