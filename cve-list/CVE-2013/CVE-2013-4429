Mahara before 1.5.12, 1.6.x before 1.6.7, and 1.7.x before 1.7.3 does
not properly restrict access to artefacts, which allows remote
authenticated users to read arbitrary artefacts via the (1) artefact
id in an upload action when creating a journal or (2)
instconf_artefactid_selected[ID] parameter in an upload action when
editing a block.
