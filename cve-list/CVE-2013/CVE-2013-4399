The remoteClientFreeFunc function in daemon/remote.c in libvirt before
1.1.3, when ACLs are used, does not set an identity, which causes
event handler removal to be denied and remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (use-after-free and crash) by registering an event
handler and then closing the connection.
