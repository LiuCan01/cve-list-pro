** DISPUTED ** The Schneider Electric M340 PLC modules allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes this issue
because it "could not be duplicated" and "an attacker could not
remotely exploit this observed behavior to deny PLC control
functions."
