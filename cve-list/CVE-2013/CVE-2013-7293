The ASUS WL-330NUL router has a configuration process that relies on
accessing the 192.168.1.1 IP address, but the documentation advises
users to instead access a DNS hostname that does not always resolve to
192.168.1.1, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack the
configuration traffic by controlling the server associated with that
hostname.
