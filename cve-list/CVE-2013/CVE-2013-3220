bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc2, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc2, 0.6.x
before 0.6.5rc2, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc2, and wxBitcoin, do not
properly consider whether a block's size could require an excessive
number of database locks, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (split) and enable certain double-spending
capabilities via a large block that triggers incorrect Berkeley DB
locking.
