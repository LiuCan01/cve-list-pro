Trimble SketchUp (formerly Google SketchUp) before 2013 (13.0.3689)
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted color
palette table in a MAC Pict texture, which triggers an out-of-bounds
stack write.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
fix for CVE-2013-3662.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT due to different
affected products and codebases (ADT1); CVE-2013-7388 has been
assigned to the paintlib issue.
