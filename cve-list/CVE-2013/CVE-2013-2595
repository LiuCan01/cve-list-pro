The device-initialization functionality in the MSM camera driver for
the Linux kernel 2.6.x and 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center
(QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products,
enables MSM_CAM_IOCTL_SET_MEM_MAP_INFO ioctl calls for an unrestricted
mmap interface, which allows attackers to gain privileges via a
crafted application.
