The default configuration of EMC RSA BSAFE Toolkits and RSA Data
Protection Manager (DPM) 20130918 uses the Dual Elliptic Curve
Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm, which
makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat
cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging unspecified
"security concerns," aka the ESA-2013-068 issue.  NOTE: this issue has
been SPLIT from CVE-2007-6755 because the vendor announcement did not
state a specific technical rationale for a change in the algorithm;
thus, CVE cannot reach a conclusion that a CVE-2007-6755 concern was
the reason, or one of the reasons, for this change.
