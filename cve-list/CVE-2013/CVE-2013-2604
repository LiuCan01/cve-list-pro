RealNetworks GameHouse RealArcade Installer (aka ActiveMARK Game
Installer) 2.6.0.481 and 3.0.7 uses weak permissions (Create
Files/Write Data) for the GameHouse Games directory tree, which allows
local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in an individual
game's directory, as demonstrated by DDRAW.DLL in the Zuma Deluxe
directory.
