WellinTech KingSCADA before 3.1.2, KingAlarm&Event before 3.1, and
KingGraphic before 3.1.2 perform authentication on the
KAEClientManager console rather than on the server, which allows
remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and discover
credentials via a crafted packet to TCP port 8130.
