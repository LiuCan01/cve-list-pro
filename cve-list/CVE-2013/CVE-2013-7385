Phase: Assigned (20140519)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/124444/LiveZilla-5.1.2.0-Insecure-Password-Storage.html

LiveZilla 5.1.2.1 and earlier includes the MD5 hash of the operator
password in plaintext in Javascript code that is generated by
lz/mobile/chat.php, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information and gain privileges by accessing the loginName and
loginPassword variables using an independent cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
fix for CVE-2013-7033.
