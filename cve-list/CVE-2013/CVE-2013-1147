Reference: CISCO:20130327 Cisco IOS Software Protocol Translation Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-pt

The Protocol Translation (PT) functionality in Cisco IOS 12.3 through
12.4 and 15.0 through 15.3, when one-step port-23 translation or a
Telnet-to-PAD ruleset is configured, does not properly validate TCP
connection information, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (device reload) via an attempted connection to a PT
resource, aka Bug ID CSCtz35999.
