The scm_check_creds function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel
before 3.8.6 does not properly enforce capability requirements for
controlling the PID value associated with a UNIX domain socket, which
allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by
leveraging the time interval during which a user namespace has been
created but a PID namespace has not been created.
