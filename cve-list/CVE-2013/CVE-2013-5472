Reference: CISCO:20130925 Cisco IOS Software Multicast Network Time Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ntp

The NTP implementation in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through
15.1, and IOS XE 2.1 through 3.3, does not properly handle
encapsulation of multicast NTP packets within MSDP SA messages, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload)
by leveraging an MSDP peer relationship, aka Bug ID CSCuc81226.
