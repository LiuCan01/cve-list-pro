Open-Xchange AppSuite before 7.0.2 rev14, 7.2.0 before rev11, 7.2.1
before rev10, and 7.2.2 before rev9 relies on user-supplied data to
predict the IMAP server hostname for an external domain name, which
allows remote authenticated users to discover e-mail credentials of
other users in opportunistic circumstances via a manual-mode
association of a personal e-mail address with the hostname of a
crafted IMAP server.
