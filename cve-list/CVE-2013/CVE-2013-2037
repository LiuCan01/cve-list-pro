httplib2 0.7.2, 0.8, and earlier, after an initial connection is made,
does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the
subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
