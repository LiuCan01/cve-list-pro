Reference: CONFIRM:https://forge.indepnet.net/projects/glpi/repository/revisions/21753/diff/branches/0.84-bugfixes/inc/central.class.php

inc/central.class.php in GLPI before 0.84.2 does not attempt to make
install/install.php unavailable after an installation is completed,
which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) attacks, and (1) perform a SQL injection via an Etape_4 action
or (2) execute arbitrary PHP code via an update_1 action.
