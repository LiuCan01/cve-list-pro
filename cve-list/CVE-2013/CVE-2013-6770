Reference: BUGTRAQ:20131113 Superuser "su --daemon" vulnerability on Android >= 4.3
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/529795

The CyanogenMod/ClockWorkMod/Koush Superuser package 1.0.2.1 for
Android 4.3 and 4.4 does not properly restrict the set of users who
can execute /system/xbin/su with the --daemon option, which allows
attackers to gain privileges by leveraging ADB shell access and a
certain Linux UID, and then creating a Trojan horse script.
