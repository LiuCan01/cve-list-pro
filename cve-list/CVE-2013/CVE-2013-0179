The process_bin_delete function in memcached.c in memcached 1.4.4 and
other versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via
a request to delete a key, which does not account for the lack of a
null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when
printing to stderr.
