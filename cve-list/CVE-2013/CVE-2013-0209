lib/MT/Upgrade.pm in mt-upgrade.cgi in Movable Type 4.2x and 4.3x
through 4.38 does not require authentication for requests to
database-migration functions, which allows remote attackers to conduct
eval injection and SQL injection attacks via crafted parameters, as
demonstrated by an eval injection attack against the
core_drop_meta_for_table function, leading to execution of arbitrary
Perl code.
