The ocaml binding for the xc_vcpu_getaffinity function in Xen 4.2.x
and 4.3.x frees certain memory that may still be intended for use,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (heap corruption
and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors
that trigger a (1) use-after-free or (2) double free.
