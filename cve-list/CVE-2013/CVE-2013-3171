The serialization functionality in Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2,
3.5, 3.5 SP1, 3.5.1, 4, and 4.5 does not properly check the
permissions of delegate objects, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted XAML browser application
(XBAP) or (2) a crafted .NET Framework application that leverages a
partial-trust relationship, aka "Delegate Serialization
Vulnerability."
