The httparty gem 0.9.0 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict
casts of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial
of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack
support for YAML type conversion, a similar vulnerability to
CVE-2013-0156.
