The RAKP protocol support in the Intelligent Platform Management
Interface (IPMI) implementation in Integrated Management Module (IMM)
and Integrated Management Module II (IMM2) on IBM BladeCenter, Flex
System, System x iDataPlex, and System x3### servers sends a password
hash to the client, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
obtain access via a brute-force attack.
