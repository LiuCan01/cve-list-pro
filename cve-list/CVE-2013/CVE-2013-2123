The Node access user reference module 6.x-3.x before 6.x-3.5 and
7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.10 for Drupal does not properly restrict access
to content containing a user reference field when the author
update/delete grants are enabled and the author's user account is
deleted, which allows remote attackers to modify the content via
unspecified vectors.
