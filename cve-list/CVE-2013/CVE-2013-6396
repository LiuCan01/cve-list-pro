Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20140217 [OSSA 2014-005] Missing SSL certificate check in Python Swift client  (CVE-2013-6396)
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/17/7
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-swiftclient/+bug/1199783

The OpenStack Python client library for Swift (python-swiftclient) 1.0
through 1.9.0 does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain
sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
