Tor before 0.2.4.20, when OpenSSL 1.x is used in conjunction with a
certain HardwareAccel setting on Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge
platforms, does not properly generate random numbers for (1) relay
identity keys and (2) hidden-service identity keys, which might make
it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection
mechanisms via unspecified vectors.
