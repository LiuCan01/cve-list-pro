Mahara before 1.5.13, 1.6.x before 1.6.8, and 1.7.x before 1.7.4 does
not properly restrict access to folders, which allows remote
authenticated users to read arbitrary folders (1) by leveraging an
active folder tab loaded before permissions were removed or (2) via
the folder parameter to artefact/file/groupfiles.php.
