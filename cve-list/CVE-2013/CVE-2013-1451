Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9, when the Proxy Settings
configuration has the same Proxy address and Port values in the HTTP
and Secure rows, does not ensure that the SSL lock icon is consistent
with the Address bar, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
spoof web sites via a crafted HTML document that triggers many HTTPS
requests to an arbitrary host, followed by an HTTPS request to a
trusted host and then an HTTP request to an untrusted host, a related
issue to CVE-2013-1450.
