Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Icinga before 1.8.5, 1.9
before 1.9.4, and 1.10 before 1.10.2 allow remote authenticated users
to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a long string to the (1) display_nav_table, (2)
page_limit_selector, (3) print_export_link, or (4) page_num_selector
function in cgi/cgiutils.c; (5) status_page_num_selector function in
cgi/status.c; or (6) display_command_expansion function in
cgi/config.c.  NOTE: this can be exploited without authentication by
leveraging CVE-2013-7107.
