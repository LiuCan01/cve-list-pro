sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.5, when the
tty_tickets option is enabled, does not properly validate the
controlling terminal device, which allows local users with sudo
permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal via
vectors related to connecting to the standard input, output, and error
file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three
closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned
CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT because of different affected
versions.
