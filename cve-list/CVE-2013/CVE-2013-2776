Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/82453

sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6, when running on
systems without /proc or the sysctl function with the tty_tickets
option enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal
device, which allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the
authorization of another terminal via vectors related to connecting to
the standard input, output, and error file descriptors of another
terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three closely-related vulnerabilities
that were originally assigned CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT
because of different affected versions.
