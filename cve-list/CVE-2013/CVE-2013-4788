The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or
libc6) 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not
initialize the random value for the pointer guard, which makes it
easier for context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by
leveraging a buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using
the known zero value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address.
