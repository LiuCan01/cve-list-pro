Reference: BUGTRAQ:20131122 Unauthorized console access on Satechi travel router v1.5
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2013-11/0123.html

The web interface on the Satechi travel router 1.5, when Wi-Fi is used
for WAN access, exposes the console without authentication on the WAN
IP address regardless of the "Web Management via WAN" setting, which
allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via
HTTP requests.
