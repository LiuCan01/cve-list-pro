The compare_dn function in utils/identification.c in strongSwan 4.3.3
through 5.1.1 allows (1) remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read, NULL pointer dereference, and daemon crash) or
(2) remote authenticated users to impersonate arbitrary users and
bypass access restrictions via a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID, related to
an "insufficient length check" during identity comparison.
