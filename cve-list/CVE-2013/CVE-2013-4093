The SecureSphere Operations Manager (SOM) Management Server in Imperva
SecureSphere 9.0.0.5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via (1) a direct request to
dwr/call/plaincall/AsyncOperationsContainer.getOperationState.dwr,
which reveals the installation path in the s0.filePath field, or (2) a
T/keyManagement request to plain/settings.html, which reveals a
temporary path in an error message.
