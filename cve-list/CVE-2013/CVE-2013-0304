Reference: MISC:http://securite.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ISEC-V2013-01-v-1.0-Owncloud-4.5.4-Arbitrary-calendar-export.pdf
Reference: CONFIRM:http://owncloud.org/about/security/advisories/oC-SA-2013-007/

ownCloud Server before 4.5.7 does not properly check ownership of
calendars, which allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary
calendars via the calid parameter to /apps/calendar/export.php.  NOTE:
this issue has been reported as a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability, but due to lack of details, it is uncertain what the
root cause is.
