The Hazelcast cluster API in Open-Xchange AppSuite 7.0.x before
7.0.2-rev15 and 7.2.x before 7.2.2-rev16 allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information about (1) runtime activity, (2) network
configuration, (3) user sessions, (4) the memcache interface, and (5)
the REST interface via API calls such as a hazelcast/rest/cluster/
call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-5200.
