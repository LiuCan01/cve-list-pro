Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/security-advisories/multiple-memory-corruption-issues-and-race-condition-goodix-gt915-touchscreen-driver-procfs-handler

goodix_tool.c in the Goodix gt915 touchscreen driver for the Linux
kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android
contributions for MSM devices and other products, relies on user-space
length values for kernel-memory copies of procfs file content, which
allows attackers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) via an application that provides crafted values.
