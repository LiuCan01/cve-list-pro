expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion
unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler
function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or
read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External
Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because expat
already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the
responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application
developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed,
and each affected application would need its own CVE.
