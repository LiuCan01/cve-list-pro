Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.1, in certain Active Directory
domain-controller configurations, does not properly interpret Access
Control Entries that are based on an objectClass, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on modifying LDAP
directory objects by leveraging (1) objectClass access by a user, (2)
objectClass access by a group, or (3) write access to an attribute.
