Heap-based buffer overflow in the XML Signature Reference
functionality in Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ (aka
xml-security-c) before 1.7.2 allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via malformed XPointer expressions.  NOTE: this is due to an incorrect
fix for CVE-2013-2154.
