Puppet Module Tool (PMT), as used in Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.23 and
3.2.x before 3.2.4, and Puppet Enterprise 2.8.x before 2.8.3 and 3.0.x
before 3.0.1, installs modules with weak permissions if those
permissions were used when the modules were originally built, which
might allow local users to read or modify those modules depending on
the original permissions.
