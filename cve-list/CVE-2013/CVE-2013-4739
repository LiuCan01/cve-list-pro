The MSM camera driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm
Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and
other products, allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via (1) a crafted MSM_MCR_IOCTL_EVT_GET ioctl
call, related to
drivers/media/platform/msm/camera_v1/mercury/msm_mercury_sync.c, or
(2) a crafted MSM_JPEG_IOCTL_EVT_GET ioctl call, related to
drivers/media/platform/msm/camera_v2/jpeg_10/msm_jpeg_sync.c.
