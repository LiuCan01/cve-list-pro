The BEGIN regular expression in the awk script detector in
magic/Magdir/commands in file before 5.15 uses multiple wildcards with
unlimited repetitions, which allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file
that triggers a large amount of backtracking, as demonstrated via a
file with many newline characters.
