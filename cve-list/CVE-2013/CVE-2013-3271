Reference: BUGTRAQ:20130820 ESA-2013-047: RSA Authentication Agent for PAM Unlimited Login Attempts Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2013-08/0123.html

EMC RSA Authentication Agent for PAM 7.0 before 7.0.2.1 enforces the
maximum number of login attempts within the PAM-enabled application
codebase, instead of within the Agent codebase, which makes it easier
for remote attackers to discover correct login credentials via a
brute-force attack.
