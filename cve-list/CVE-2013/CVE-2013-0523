IBM WebSphere Commerce Enterprise 5.6.x through 5.6.1.5, 6.0.x through
6.0.0.11, and 7.0.x through 7.0.0.7 does not use a suitable encryption
algorithm for storefront web requests, which allows remote attackers
to obtain sensitive information via a padding oracle attack that
targets certain UTF-8 processing of the krypto parameter, and
leverages unspecified browser access or traffic-log access.
