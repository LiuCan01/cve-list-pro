Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the MSM camera driver for the
Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android
contributions for MSM devices and other products, allow attackers to
gain privileges via (1) a crafted
VIDIOC_MSM_VPE_DEQUEUE_STREAM_BUFF_INFO ioctl call, related to
drivers/media/platform/msm/camera_v2/pproc/vpe/msm_vpe.c, or (2) a
crafted VIDIOC_MSM_CPP_DEQUEUE_STREAM_BUFF_INFO ioctl call, related to
drivers/media/platform/msm/camera_v2/pproc/cpp/msm_cpp.c.
