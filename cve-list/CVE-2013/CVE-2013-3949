The posix_spawn system call in the XNU kernel in Apple Mac OS X 10.8.x
does not prevent use of the _POSIX_SPAWN_DISABLE_ASLR and
_POSIX_SPAWN_ALLOW_DATA_EXEC flags for setuid and setgid programs,
which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a
wrapper program that calls the posix_spawnattr_setflags function.
