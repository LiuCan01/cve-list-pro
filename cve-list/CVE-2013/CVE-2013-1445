Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/commit/19dcf7b15d61b7dc1a125a367151de40df6ef175
Reference: DEBIAN:DSA-2781
Reference: URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2013/dsa-2781

The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not
properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before
allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for
context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by
leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and
accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another
process.
