Reference: CONFIRM:http://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-12747

CiviCRM 2.0.0 through 4.2.9 and 4.3.0 through 4.3.3 does not properly
enforce role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions for default
custom searches, which allows remote authenticated users with the
"access CiviCRM" permission to bypass intended access restrictions, as
demonstrated by accessing custom contribution data without having the
"access CiviContribute" permission.
