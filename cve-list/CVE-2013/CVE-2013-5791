Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology
component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.4.0 and 8.4.1 allows
context-dependent attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors
related to Outside In Filters.  NOTE: the previous information is from
the October 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third
party that the issue is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft
Access 1.x parser in vsacs.dll before 8.4.0.108 and before 8.4.1.52,
which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long field (aka
column) name.
