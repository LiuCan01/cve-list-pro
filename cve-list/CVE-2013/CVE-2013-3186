The Protected Mode feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 through 10
on Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7
SP1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT does not properly
implement the Integrity Access Level (aka IL) protection mechanism,
which allows remote attackers to obtain medium-integrity privileges by
leveraging access to a low-integrity process, aka "Process Integrity
Level Assignment Vulnerability."
