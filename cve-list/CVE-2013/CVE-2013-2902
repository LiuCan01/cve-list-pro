Use-after-free vulnerability in the XSLT ProcessingInstruction
implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 29.0.1547.57,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via vectors related to an applyXSLTransform
call involving (1) an HTML document or (2) an
xsl:processing-instruction element that is still in the process of
loading.
