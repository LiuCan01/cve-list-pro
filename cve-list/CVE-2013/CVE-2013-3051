The TrustZone kernel, when used in conjunction with a certain Motorola
build of Android 4.1.2, on Motorola Razr HD, Razr M, and Atrix HD
devices with the Qualcomm MSM8960 chipset does not verify the
association between a certain physical-address argument and a memory
region, which allows local users to unlock the bootloader by using
kernel mode to perform crafted 0x9 and 0x2 SMC operations, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2013-2596.
