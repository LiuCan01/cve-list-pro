Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in OpenX
2.8.10, possibly before revision 82710, allow remote attackers to
hijack the authentication of administrators, as demonstrated by
requests that conduct directory traversal attacks via the group
parameter to (1) plugin-preferences.php or (2) plugin-settings.php in
www/admin, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-3514.
