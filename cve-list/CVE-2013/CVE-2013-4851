The vfs_hang_addrlist function in sys/kern/vfs_export.c in the NFS
server implementation in the kernel in FreeBSD 8.3 and 9.x through
9.1-RELEASE-p5 controls authorization for host/subnet export entries
on the basis of group information sent by the client, which allows
remote attackers to bypass file permissions on NFS filesystems via
crafted requests.
