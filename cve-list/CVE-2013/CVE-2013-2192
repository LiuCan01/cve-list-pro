The RPC protocol implementation in Apache Hadoop 2.x before
2.0.6-alpha, 0.23.x before 0.23.9, and 1.x before 1.2.1, when the
Kerberos security features are enabled, allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to disable bidirectional authentication and obtain sensitive
information by forcing a downgrade to simple authentication.
