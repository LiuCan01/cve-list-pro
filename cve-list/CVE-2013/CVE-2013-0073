The Windows Forms (aka WinForms) component in Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0 SP2, 3.5, 3.5.1, 4, and 4.5 does not properly restrict the
privileges of a callback function during object creation, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted XAML
browser application (XBAP) or (2) a crafted .NET Framework
application, aka "WinForms Callback Elevation Vulnerability."
