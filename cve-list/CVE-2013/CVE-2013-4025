IBM Data Studio Web Console 3.x before 3.2, Optim Performance Manager
5.x before 5.2, InfoSphere Optim Configuration Manager 2.x before 2.2,
and DB2 Recovery Expert 2.x do not have an off autocomplete attribute
for the login-password field, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain access by leveraging an unattended workstation.
