Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
js/tabletools/zeroclipboard.swf in the WP-Table Reloaded module before
1.9.4 for Wordpress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via the id parameter.  NOTE: this might be the same
vulnerability as CVE-2013-1808.  If so, it is likely that
CVE-2013-1463 will be REJECTed.
