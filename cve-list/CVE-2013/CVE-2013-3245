** DISPUTED ** plugins/demux/libmkv_plugin.dll in VideoLAN VLC Media
Player 2.0.7, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a crafted MKV file, possibly involving an integer overflow and
out-of-bounds read or heap-based buffer overflow, or an uncaught
exception.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the severity and claimed
vulnerability type of this issue, stating "This PoC crashes VLC,
indeed, but does nothing more... this is not an integer overflow
error, but an uncaught exception and I doubt that it is exploitable.
This uncaught exception makes VLC abort, not execute random code, on
my Linux 64bits machine." A PoC posted by the original researcher
shows signs of an attacker-controlled out-of-bounds read, but the
affected instruction does not involve a register that directly
influences control flow.
