Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2013-1190

The C-Series Rack Server component 1.4 in Cisco Unified Computing

allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (Integrated
Management Controller reboot or hang) via crafted packets, as
demonstrated by nmap, aka Bug ID CSCtx19850.
