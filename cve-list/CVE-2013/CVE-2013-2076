Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x, when running on AMD64 processors, only
save/restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR
when an exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine
portions of the state of floating point instructions of other domains,
which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as
cryptographic keys, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056.  NOTE:
this is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is
inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that
was not addressed by the kernels.
