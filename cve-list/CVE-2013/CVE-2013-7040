Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to
randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without
restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and
makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that
maintains a hash table.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1150.
