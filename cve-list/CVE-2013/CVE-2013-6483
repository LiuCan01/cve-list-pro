The XMPP protocol plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.8 does not
properly determine whether the from address in an iq reply is
consistent with the to address in an iq request, which allows remote
attackers to spoof iq traffic or cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted reply.
