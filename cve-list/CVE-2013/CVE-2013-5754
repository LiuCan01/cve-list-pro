The authorization implementation on Dahua DVR appliances accepts a
hash string representing the current date for the role of a master
password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
administrative access and change the administrator password via
requests involving (1) ActiveX, (2) a standalone client, or (3)
unspecified other vectors, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2013-3612.
