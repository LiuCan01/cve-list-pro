** DISPUTED ** The readObject method in the DiskFileItem class in
Apache Tomcat and JBoss Web, as used in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.0.0, allows
remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a NULL byte in a file
name in a serialized instance, a similar issue to CVE-2013-2186.  NOTE:
this issue is reportedly disputed by the Apache Tomcat team, although
Red Hat considers it a vulnerability. The dispute appears to regard
whether it is the responsibility of applications to avoid providing
untrusted data to be deserialized, or whether this class should
inherently protect against this issue.
