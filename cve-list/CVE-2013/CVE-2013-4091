The SecureSphere Operations Manager (SOM) Management Server in Imperva
SecureSphere 9.0.0.5 does not have an off autocomplete attribute for
the password (aka j_password) field on the secsphLogin.jsp login page,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by
leveraging an unattended workstation.
