Certain getText methods in the ActionSupport controller in Apache
Roller before 5.0.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL
expressions via the first or second parameter, as demonstrated by the
pageTitle parameter in the !getPageTitle sub-URL to
roller-ui/login.rol, which uses a subclass of UIAction, aka "OGNL
Injection."
