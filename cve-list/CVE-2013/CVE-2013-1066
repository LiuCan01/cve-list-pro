language-selector 0.110.x before 0.110.1, 0.90.x before 0.90.1, and
0.79.x before 0.79.4 does not properly use D-Bus for communication
with a polkit authority, which allows local users to bypass intended
access restrictions by leveraging a PolkitUnixProcess PolkitSubject
race condition via a (1) setuid process or (2) pkexec process, a
related issue to CVE-2013-4288.
