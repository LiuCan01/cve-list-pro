A certain Red Hat patch to the KVM subsystem in the kernel package
before 2.6.32-358.11.1.el6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 does
not properly implement the PV EOI feature, which allows guest OS users
to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) by leveraging a time
window during which interrupts are disabled but copy_to_user function
calls are possible.
