** DISPUTED ** Atlassian Crowd 2.6.3 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors related to a
"symmetric backdoor."  NOTE: as of 20130704, the vendor could not
reproduce the issue, stating "We've been unable to substantiate the
existence of [CVE-2013-3926]. The author of the article has not
contacted Atlassian and has provided no detail, making it difficult to
validate the claim... If we can confirm that there is a vulnerability,
a patch will be issued."
