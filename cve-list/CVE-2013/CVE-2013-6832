Reference: FULLDISC:20131115 XADV-2013005 FreeBSD 10 <= nand Driver IOCTL Kernel Memory Leak Bug
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2013-11/0106.html

The nand_ioctl function in sys/dev/nand/nand_geom.c in the nand driver
in the kernel in FreeBSD 10 and earlier does not properly initialize a
certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.
