The default soap.wsdl_cache_dir setting in (1) php.ini-production and
(2) php.ini-development in PHP through 5.6.7 specifies the /tmp
directory, which makes it easier for local users to conduct WSDL
injection attacks by creating a file under /tmp with a predictable
filename that is used by the get_sdl function in ext/soap/php_sdl.c.
