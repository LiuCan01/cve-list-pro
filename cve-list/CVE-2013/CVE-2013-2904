Use-after-free vulnerability in the Document::finishedParsing function
in core/dom/Document.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
29.0.1547.57, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via an onload event that
changes an IFRAME element so that its src attribute is no longer an
XML document, leading to unintended garbage collection of this
document.
