** DISPUTED ** The Zend Engine in PHP before 5.4.16 RC1, and 5.5.0
before RC2, does not properly determine whether a parser error
occurred, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
of service (memory consumption and application crash) via a crafted
function definition, as demonstrated by an attack within a shared
web-hosting environment.  NOTE: the vendor's
http://php.net/security-note.php page says "for critical security
situations you should be using OS-level security by running multiple
web servers each as their own user id."
