HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.17, and earlier module
for Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "."
character as the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior
that may assume the suffix is well-formed.
