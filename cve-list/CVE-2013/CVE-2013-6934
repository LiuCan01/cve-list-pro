The parseRTSPRequestString function in Live Networks Live555 Streaming
Media 2013.11.26, as used in VideoLAN VLC Media Player, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a space character at the beginning of an RTSP
message, which triggers an integer underflow, infinite loop, and
buffer overflow.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2013-6933.
