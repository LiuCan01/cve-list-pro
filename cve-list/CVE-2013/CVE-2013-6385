The form API in Drupal 6.x before 6.29 and 7.x before 7.24, when used
with unspecified third-party modules, performs form validation even
when CSRF validation has failed, which might allow remote attackers to
trigger application-specific impacts such as arbitrary code execution
via application-specific vectors.
