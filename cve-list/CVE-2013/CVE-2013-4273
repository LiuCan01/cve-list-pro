The Entity API module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.2 for Drupal does not
properly restrict access to node comments, which allows remote
authenticated users to read the comments via unspecified vectors.
NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT per ADT5 due to different researcher
organizations. CVE-2013-7391 was assigned for the View vector.
