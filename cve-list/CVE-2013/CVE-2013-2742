Reference: FULLDISC:20130323 Backupbuddy wordpress plugin - sensitive data exposure in importbuddy.php
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2013-03/0205.html
Reference: MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/120923

importbuddy.php in the BackupBuddy plugin 1.3.4, 2.1.4, 2.2.25,
2.2.28, and 2.2.4 for WordPress does not reliably delete itself after
completing a restore operation, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain access via subsequent requests to this script.
