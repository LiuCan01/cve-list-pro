Open-Xchange AppSuite 7.0.x before 7.0.2-rev15 and 7.2.x before
7.2.2-rev16 has a hardcoded password for node join operations, which
allows remote attackers to expand a cluster by finding this password
in the source code and then sending the password in a Hazelcast
cluster API call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-5200.
