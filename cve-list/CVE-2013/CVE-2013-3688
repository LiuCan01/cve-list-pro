The TP-Link IP Cameras TL-SC3171, TL-SC3130, TL-SC3130G, TL-SC3171G,
and possibly other models before beta firmware LM.1.6.18P12_sign6,
does not properly restrict access to certain administrative functions,

reboot) via a request to cgi-bin/reboot or (2) cause a denial of
service (reboot and reset to factory defaults) via a request to
cgi-bin/hardfactorydefault.
