The web server in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM) 10.3
and 11.2 before 11.2.4 does not properly perform authentication for
zenworks/jsp/index.jsp, which allows remote attackers to conduct
directory traversal attacks, and consequently upload and execute
arbitrary programs, via a request to TCP port 443.
