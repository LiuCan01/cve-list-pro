The OSPF implementation in IBM i 6.1 and 7.1, in z/OS on zSeries
servers, and in Networking Operating System (aka NOS, formerly BLADE
Operating System) does not properly validate Link State Advertisement
(LSA) type 1 packets before performing operations on the LSA database,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (routing
disruption) or obtain sensitive packet information via a crafted LSA
packet, a related issue to CVE-2013-0149.
