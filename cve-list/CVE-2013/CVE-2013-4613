The default configuration of the administrative interface on the Canon
MG3100, MG5300, MG6100, MP495, MX340, MX870, MX890, MX920, and MX922
printers does not require authentication, which allows remote
attackers to modify the configuration by visiting the Advanced page.
NOTE: the vendor has apparently responded by stating "for user
convenience, the default setting does not require a password. However,
if a user has a particular concern about third parties accessing the
user's home printer, the default setting can be changed to add a
password."
