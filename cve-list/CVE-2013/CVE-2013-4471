Reference: MLIST:[Openstack] 20131122 [OSSG][OSSN] Authenticated users are able to update passwords without providing their current password
Reference: URL:http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack/2013-November/003299.html
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1237989

The Identity v3 API in OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) before 2013.2
does not require the current password when changing passwords for user
accounts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to change a user
password by leveraging the authentication token for that user.
