The App-ID cache feature in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS before 4.0.14,
4.1.x before 4.1.11, and 5.0.x before 5.0.2 allows remote attackers to
bypass intended security policies via crafted requests that trigger
invalid caching, as demonstrated by incorrect identification of HTTP
traffic as SIP traffic, aka Ref ID 47195.
