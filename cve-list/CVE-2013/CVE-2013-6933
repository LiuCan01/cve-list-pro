The parseRTSPRequestString function in Live Networks Live555 Streaming
Media 2011.08.13 through 2013.11.25, as used in VideoLAN VLC Media
Player, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a (1) space or (2) tab
character at the beginning of an RTSP message, which triggers an
