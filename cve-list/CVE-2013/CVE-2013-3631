NAS4Free 9.1.0.1.804 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a request to exec.php, aka the
"Advanced | Execute Command" feature.  NOTE: this issue might not be a
vulnerability, since it appears to be part of legitimate,
intentionally-exposed functionality by the developer and is allowed
within the intended security policy.
