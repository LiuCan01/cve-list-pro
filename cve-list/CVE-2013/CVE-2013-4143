Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/xlock/xlockmore.README

The (1) checkPasswd and (2) checkGroupXlockPasswds functions in
xlockmore before 5.43 do not properly handle when a NULL value is
returned upon an error by the crypt or dispcrypt function as
implemented in glibc 2.17 and later, which allows attackers to bypass
the screen lock via vectors related to invalid salts.
