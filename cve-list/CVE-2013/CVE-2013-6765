OpenVAS Manager 3.0 before 3.0.7 and 4.0 before 4.0.4 allows remote
attackers to bypass the OMP authentication restrictions and execute
OMP commands via a crafted OMP request for version information, which
causes the state to be set to CLIENT_AUTHENTIC, as demonstrated by the
omp_xml_handle_end_element function in omp.c.
