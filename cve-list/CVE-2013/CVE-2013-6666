The PepperFlashRendererHost::OnNavigate function in
renderer/pepper/pepper_flash_renderer_host.cc in Google Chrome before
33.0.1750.146 does not verify that all headers are Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing (CORS) simple headers before proceeding with a
PPB_Flash.Navigate operation, which might allow remote attackers to
bypass intended CORS restrictions via an inappropriate header.
