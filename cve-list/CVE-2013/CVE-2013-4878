The default configuration of Parallels Plesk Panel 9.0.x and 9.2.x on
UNIX, and Small Business Panel 10.x on UNIX, has an improper
ScriptAlias directive for phppath, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2012-1823.
