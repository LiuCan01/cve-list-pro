Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle WebCenter Content component in
Oracle Fusion Middleware 10.1.3.5.1, 11.1.1.6.0, and 11.1.1.7.0 allows
remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality and integrity via
unknown vectors related to Content Server.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the October 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
claims from a third party that the issue is related to "iDoc script
injection" in the (1) cs and (2) urm components, which allows
attackers to read "sensitive" files, as demonstrated by obtaining the
"AES encryption key and encrypted credentials" of the weblogic user.
