** DISPUTED ** The Embedded Jopr component in JBoss Application Server
includes the cleartext datasource password in unspecified HTML
responses, which might allow (1) man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain
sensitive information by leveraging failure to use SSL or (2)
attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the HTML source
code.  NOTE: the vendor says that this does not cross a trust boundary
and that it is recommended best-practice that SSL is configured for
the administrative console.
