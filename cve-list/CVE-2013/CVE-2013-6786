Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Allegro RomPager before
4.51, as used on the ZyXEL P660HW-D1, Huawei MT882, Sitecom WL-174,
TP-LINK TD-8816, and D-Link DSL-2640R and DSL-2641R, when the
"forbidden author header" protection mechanism is bypassed, allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by requesting
a nonexistent URI in conjunction with a crafted HTTP Referer header
that is not properly handled in a 404 page.  NOTE: there is no CVE for
a "URL redirection" issue that some sources list separately.
