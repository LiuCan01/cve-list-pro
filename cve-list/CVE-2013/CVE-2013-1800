The crack gem 0.3.1 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict
casts of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial
of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack
support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a
similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
