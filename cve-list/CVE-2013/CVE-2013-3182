The Windows NAT Driver (aka winnat) service in Microsoft Windows
Server 2012 does not properly validate memory addresses during the
processing of ICMP packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption and system hang) via crafted
packets, aka "Windows NAT Denial of Service Vulnerability."
