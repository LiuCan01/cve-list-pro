Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.codeaurora.org/cgit/quic/la/kernel/msm/commit/drivers/base/genlock.c?id=e3c43027bdb59f03eec7ead0a01c77e4bf801625&h=jb_3.2.3

The genlock_dev_ioctl function in genlock.c in the Genlock driver for
the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC)
Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not
properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a crafted
GENLOCK_IOC_EXPORT ioctl call.
