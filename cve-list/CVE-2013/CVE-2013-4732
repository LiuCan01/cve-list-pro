** DISPUTED ** The administrative web server on the Digital Alert
Systems DASDEC EAS device through 2.0-2 and the Monroe Electronics
R189 One-Net EAS device through 2.0-2 uses predictable session ID
values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack sessions
by sniffing the network.  NOTE: VU#662676 states "Monroe Electronics
could not reproduce this finding."
