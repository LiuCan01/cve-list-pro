The RPM GPG key import and handling feature in libzypp 12.15.0 and
earlier reports a different key fingerprint than the one used to sign
a repository when multiple key blobs are used, which might allow
remote attackers to trick users into believing that the repository was
signed by a more-trustworthy key.
