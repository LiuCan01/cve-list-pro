The printer friendly version functionality in the Book module in
Drupal 6.x before 6.28 and 7.x before 7.19 does not properly restrict
access to node that are part of a book outline, which allows remote
authenticated users with the "access printer-friendly version"
permission to read node titles and possibly node content via
unspecified vectors.
