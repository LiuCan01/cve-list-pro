Buffer overflow in the "read-string!" procedure in the "extras" unit
in CHICKEN stable before 4.8.0.5 and development snapshots before
4.8.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a "#f" value in the NUM argument.
