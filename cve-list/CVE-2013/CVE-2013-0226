The Keyboard Shortcut Utility module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.1 for Drupal
does not properly check node restrictions, which allows (1) remote
authenticated users with the "view shortcuts" permission to read nodes
or (2) remote authenticated users with the "admin shortcuts"
permission to read, edit, or delete nodes via unspecified vectors.
