Buffer overflow in the atodn function in strongSwan 2.0.0 through
4.3.4, when Opportunistic Encryption is enabled and an RSA key is
being used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(pluto IKE daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted DNS TXT records.  NOTE: this might be the same vulnerability as
CVE-2013-2053 and CVE-2013-2054.
