Stack-based buffer overflow in gen_jumpex.dll in Winamp before 5.64
Build 3418 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a package with a long
Skin directory name.  NOTE: a second buffer overflow involving a long
GUI Search field to ml_local.dll was also reported. However, since it
is only exploitable by the user of the application, this issue would
not cross privilege boundaries unless Winamp is running under a highly
restricted environment such as a kiosk.
