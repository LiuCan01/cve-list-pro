Reference: BUGTRAQ:20130910 Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2013-09-10
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2013-09/0032.html

The Hazelcast cluster API in Open-Xchange AppSuite 7.0.x before
7.0.2-rev15 and 7.2.x before 7.2.2-rev16 does not properly restrict
the set of network interfaces that can receive API calls, which makes
it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by sending network
traffic from an unintended location, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2013-5200.
