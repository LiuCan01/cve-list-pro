usersfile.c in liboath in OATH Toolkit before 2.4.1 does not properly
handle lines containing an invalid one-time-password (OTP) type and a
user name in /etc/users.oath, which causes the wrong line to be
updated when invalidating an OTP and allows context-dependent
attackers to conduct replay attacks, as demonstrated by a commented
out line when using libpam-oath.
