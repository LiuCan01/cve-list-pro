Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in report.cgi in
Bugzilla 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.7 and 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4.1
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
field value that is not properly handled during construction of a
tabular report, as demonstrated by the (1) summary or (2) real name
field.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2012-4189.
