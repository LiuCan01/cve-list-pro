Juniper Junos 12.1X44 before 12.1.X44-D20 and 12.1X45 before
12.1X45-D15, when the no-validate option is enabled, does not properly
handle configuration validation errors during the config commit phase
of the boot-up sequence, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication via unspecified vectors.
