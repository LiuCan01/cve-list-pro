Multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in (1)
media-upload.php, (2) media-upload-lncthumb.php, and (3)
media-upload-sq_button.php in lib/admin/ in the OptimizePress theme
before 1.61 for WordPress allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code by uploading a file with an executable extension, then accessing
it via a direct request to the file in images_comingsoon,
images_lncthumbs, or images_optbuttons in
wp-content/uploads/optpress/, as exploited in the wild in November
2013.
