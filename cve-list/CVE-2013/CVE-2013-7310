The OSPF implementation on Yamaha routers does not consider the
possibility of duplicate Link State ID values in Link State
Advertisement (LSA) packets before performing operations on the LSA
database, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(routing disruption) or obtain sensitive packet information via a
crafted LSA packet, a related issue to CVE-2013-0149.
