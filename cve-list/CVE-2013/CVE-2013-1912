Buffer overflow in HAProxy 1.4 through 1.4.22 and 1.5-dev through
1.5-dev17, when HTTP keep-alive is enabled, using HTTP keywords in TCP
inspection rules, and running with rewrite rules that appends to
requests, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted pipelined HTTP
requests that prevent request realignment from occurring.
