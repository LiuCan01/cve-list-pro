Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in the layout implementation
in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117, allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
other impact via vectors involving (1) running JavaScript code during
execution of the updateWidgetPositions function or (2) making a call
into a plugin during execution of the updateWidgetPositions function.
