Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in
Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb in
RubyGems before 1.8.23.2, 1.8.24 through 1.8.26, 2.0.x before 2.0.10,
and 2.1.x before 2.1.5, as used in Ruby 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
via a crafted gem version that triggers a large amount of backtracking
in a regular expression.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix
for CVE-2013-4287.
