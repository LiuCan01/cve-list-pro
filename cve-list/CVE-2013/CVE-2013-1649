Reference: BUGTRAQ:20130313 Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2013-03-13
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2013-03/0075.html

Open-Xchange Server before 6.20.7 rev14, 6.22.0 before rev13, and
6.22.1 before rev14 uses the crypt and SHA-1 algorithms for password
hashing, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
obtain cleartext passwords via a brute-force attack.
