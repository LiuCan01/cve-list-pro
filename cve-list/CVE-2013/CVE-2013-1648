Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2013-03/0075.html

The Subscriptions feature in Open-Xchange Server before 6.20.7 rev14,
6.22.0 before rev13, and 6.22.1 before rev14 does not properly
validate the publication-source URL, which allows remote authenticated
users to trigger arbitrary outbound TCP traffic via a crafted Source
field, as demonstrated by (1) an ftp: URL, (2) a gopher: URL, or (3)
an http://127.0.0.1/ URL, related to a "Server-side request forging
(SSRF)" issue.
