Reference: URL:http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-1790-1

The iff_read_header function in iff.c in libavformat in FFmpeg through
1.1.3 does not properly handle data sizes for Interchange File Format
(IFF) data during operations involving a CMAP chunk or a video codec,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer
overflow, out-of-bounds array access, and application crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted header.
