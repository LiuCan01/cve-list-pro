The libvirt driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.2.2 and
icehouse before icehouse-2 allows remote authenticated users to cause
a denial of service (disk consumption) by creating and deleting
instances with unique os_type settings, which triggers the creation of
a new ephemeral disk backing file.
