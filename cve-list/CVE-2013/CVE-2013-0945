Reference: BUGTRAQ:20130502 ESA-2013-035: EMC Avamar Client Improper Certificate Validation Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2013-05/0014.html

EMC Avamar Client before 6.1.101-89 does not verify that the server
hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
valid certificate.
