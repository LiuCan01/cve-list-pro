The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel
through 4.x mishandles requests for Graphics Execution Manager (GEM)
objects, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) via an application that processes
graphics data, as demonstrated by JavaScript code that creates many
CANVAS elements for rendering by Chrome or Firefox.
