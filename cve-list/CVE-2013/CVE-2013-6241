The Birthday widget in the backend in Open-Xchange (OX) AppSuite 7.2.x
before 7.2.2-rev25 and 7.4.x before 7.4.0-rev14, in certain user-id
sharing scenarios, does not properly construct a SQL statement for
next-year birthdays, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain
sensitive birthday, displayname, firstname, and surname information
via a birthdays action to api/contacts, aka bug 29315.
