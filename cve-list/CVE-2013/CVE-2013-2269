The Sponsorship Confirmation functionality in Aruba Networks ClearPass
5.x, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2, and Amigopod/ClearPass Guest 3.0 through 3.9.7,
allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and
approve a request by sending a guest request, then using "parameter
manipulation" in conjunction with information from a "default holding
page" to discover the link that is used for sponsor approval of the
guest request, then performing a direct request to that link.
