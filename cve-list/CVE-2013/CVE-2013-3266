The nfsrvd_readdir function in sys/fs/nfsserver/nfs_nfsdport.c in the
new NFS server in FreeBSD 8.0 through 9.1-RELEASE-p3 does not verify
that a READDIR request is for a directory node, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
execute arbitrary code by specifying a plain file instead of a
directory.
