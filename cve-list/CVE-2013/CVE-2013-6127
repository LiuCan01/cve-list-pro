The SUPERGRIDLib.SuperGrid ActiveX control in SuperGrid.ocx before
65.30.30000.10002 in WellinTech KingView before 6.53 does not properly
restrict ReplaceDBFile method calls, which allows remote attackers to
create or overwrite arbitrary files, and subsequently execute
arbitrary programs, via the two pathname arguments, as demonstrated by
a directory traversal attack.
