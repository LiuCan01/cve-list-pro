The Risk Based Access functionality in IBM Tivoli Federated Identity
Manager (TFIM) 6.2.2 before FP9 and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager
Business Gateway (TFIMBG) 6.2.2 before FP9 does not prevent reuse of

authenticated users to complete transactions by leveraging access to
an already-used token.
