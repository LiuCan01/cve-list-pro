Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, in certain configurations involving
legacy My Sites, does not properly establish default access controls
for a SharePoint list, which allows remote authenticated users to
bypass intended restrictions on reading list items via a direct
request for a list's location, aka "Incorrect Access Rights
Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
