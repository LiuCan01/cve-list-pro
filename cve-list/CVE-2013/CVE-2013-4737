Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.codeaurora.org/projects/security-advisories/configstrictmemoryrwx-not-strictly-enforced-cve-2013-4737

The CONFIG_STRICT_MEMORY_RWX implementation for the Linux kernel 3.x,
as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for
MSM devices and other products, does not properly consider certain
memory sections, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions by leveraging the presence of RWX memory
at a fixed location.
