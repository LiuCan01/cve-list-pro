The posix_spawn system call in the XNU kernel in Apple Mac OS X 10.8.x
does not properly validate the data for file actions and port actions,
which allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service (panic) via
a size value that is inconsistent with a header count field, or (2)
obtain sensitive information from kernel heap memory via a certain
size value in conjunction with a crafted buffer.
