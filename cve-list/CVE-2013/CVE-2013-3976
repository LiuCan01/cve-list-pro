The (1) Data Protection for Exchange component 6.1 before 6.1.3.4 and
6.3 before 6.3.1 in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail and the (2)
FlashCopy Manager for Exchange component 2.2 and 3.1 before 3.1.1 in
IBM Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager do not properly constrain mailbox
contents during certain PST restore operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to read the personal e-mail of other users in
opportunistic circumstances by launching an e-mail client after an
administrator performs a multiple-mailbox restore.
