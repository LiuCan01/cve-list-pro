The SIP channel driver (channels/chan_sip.c) in Asterisk Open Source
1.8.17.x through 1.8.22.x, 1.8.23.x before 1.8.23.1, and 11.x before
11.5.1 and Certified Asterisk 1.8.15 before 1.8.15-cert3 and 11.2
before 11.2-cert2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference, segmentation fault, and daemon crash) via
an ACK with SDP to a previously terminated channel.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
