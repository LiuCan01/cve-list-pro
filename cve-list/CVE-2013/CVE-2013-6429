The SourceHttpMessageConverter in Spring MVC in Spring Framework
before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0.M1 through 4.0.0.RC1 does not disable external
entity resolution, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary
files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via crafted
XML, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, and a different
vulnerability than CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-7315.
