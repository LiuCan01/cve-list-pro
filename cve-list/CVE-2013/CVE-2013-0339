libxml2 through 2.9.1 does not properly handle external entities
expansion unless an application developer uses the
xmlSAX2ResolveEntity or xmlSetExternalEntityLoader function, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read
arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity
(XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because libxml2 already
provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the
responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application
developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed
and each affected application would need its own CVE.
