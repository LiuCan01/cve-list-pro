Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the agent interface (agc/)
in VICIDIAL dialer (aka Asterisk GUI client) 2.8-403a, 2.7, 2.7RC1,
and earlier allow (1) remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the campaign variable in SCRIPT_multirecording_AJAX.php,
(2) remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via
the server_ip parameter to manager_send.php, or (3) other unspecified
vectors.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
