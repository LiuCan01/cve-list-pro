** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the
Manager application in Apache Tomcat 5.5.25 and earlier allows remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests
that manipulate application deployment via the POST method, as
demonstrated by a /manager/html/undeploy?path= URI.  NOTE: the vendor
disputes the significance of this report, stating that "the Apache
Tomcat Security team has not accepted any reports of CSRF attacks
against the Manager application ... as they require a reckless system
administrator."
