Race condition in the post-installation script
(mysql-server-5.5.postinst) for MySQL Server 5.5 for Debian GNU/Linux
and Ubuntu Linux creates a configuration file with world-readable
permissions before restricting the permissions, which allows local
users to read the file and obtain sensitive information such as
credentials.
