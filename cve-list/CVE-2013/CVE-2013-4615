The Canon MG3100, MG5300, MG6100, MP495, MX340, MX870, MX890, MX920,
and MX922 printers allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(device hang) via a crafted LAN_TXT24 parameter to
English/pages_MacUS/cgi_lan.cgi followed by a direct request to
English/pages_MacUS/lan_set_content.html.  NOTE: the vendor has
apparently responded by stating "Canon believes that its printers will
not have to deal with unauthorized access to the network from an
external location as long as the printers are used in a secured
environment."
