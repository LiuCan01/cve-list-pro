The SMB2 implementation in Samba 3.6.x before 3.6.6, as used on the
IBM Storwize V7000 Unified 1.3 before 1.3.2.3 and 1.4 before 1.4.0.1
and possibly other products, does not properly enforce CIFS share
attributes, which allows remote authenticated users to (1) write to a
read-only share; (2) trigger data-integrity problems related to the
oplock, locking, coherency, or leases attribute; or (3) have an
unspecified impact by leveraging incorrect handling of the browseable
or "hide unreadable" parameter.
