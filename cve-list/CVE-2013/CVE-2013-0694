The Emerson Process Management ROC800 RTU with software 3.50 and
earlier, DL8000 RTU with software 2.30 and earlier, and ROC800L RTU
with software 1.20 and earlier have hardcoded credentials in a ROM,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain shell access to
the underlying OS by leveraging knowledge of the ROM contents from a
product installation elsewhere.
