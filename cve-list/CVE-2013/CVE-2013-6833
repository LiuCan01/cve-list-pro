Reference: FULLDISC:20131115 XADV-2013006 FreeBSD <= 10 kernel qlxge/qlxgbe Driver IOCTL Multiple Kernel Memory Leak Bugs
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2013-11/0107.html

The qls_eioctl function in sys/dev/qlxge/qls_ioctl.c in the kernel in
FreeBSD 10 and earlier does not validate a certain size parameter,
which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
memory via a crafted ioctl call.
