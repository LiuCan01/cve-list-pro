The configuration file for the FastCGI PHP support for lighttpd before
1.4.28 on Debian GNU/Linux creates a socket file with a predictable name
in /tmp, which allows local users to hijack the PHP control socket and
perform unauthorized actions such as forcing the use of a different
version of PHP via a symlink attack or a race condition.
