The OSPF implementation on NEC IP38X, IX1000, IX2000, and IX3000
routers does not consider the possibility of duplicate Link State ID
values in Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets before performing
operations on the LSA database, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (routing disruption) or obtain sensitive packet
information via a crafted LSA packet, a related issue to
CVE-2013-0149.
