The Spaces OG submodule in the Spaces module 6.x-3.x before 6.x-3.7
for Drupal does not properly delete organic group group spaces content
when using the option to move to a new group, which causes the content
to be "orphaned" and allows remote authenticated users with the
"access content" permission to obtain sensitive information via
vectors involving a rebuild access for the site or content.
