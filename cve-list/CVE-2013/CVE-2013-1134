The Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) Intracluster-communication
feature in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) 9.x before
9.1(1) does not require authentication from the remote LBM Hub node,

against transaction records, and cause a denial of service
(bandwidth-pool consumption and call outage), via unspecified vectors,
aka Bug ID CSCub28920.
