The tNetTaskLimit process on the Transport Node Controller (TNC) on
Cisco ONS 15454 devices with software 9.6 and earlier does not
properly prioritize health pings, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (watchdog timeout and TNC reset) via a flood
of network traffic, aka Bug ID CSCud97155.
