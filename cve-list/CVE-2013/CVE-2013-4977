Buffer overflow in the RTSP Packet Handler in Hikvision DS-2CD7153-E
IP camera with firmware 4.1.0 b130111 (Jan 2013), and possibly other
devices, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device
crash and reboot) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long
string in the Range header field in an RTSP transaction.
