The SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.8.x before 1.8.20.2,
10.x before 10.12.2, and 11.x before 11.2.2; Certified Asterisk 1.8.15

C.3.8.1; and Asterisk Digiumphones 10.x-digiumphones before
10.12.2-digiumphones exhibits different behavior for invalid INVITE,
SUBSCRIBE, and REGISTER transactions depending on whether the user
account exists, which allows remote attackers to enumerate account
names by (1) reading HTTP status codes, (2) reading additional text in
a 403 (aka Forbidden) response, or (3) observing whether certain
retransmissions occur.
