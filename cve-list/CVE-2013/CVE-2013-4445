The json rendering functionality in the Context module 6.x-2.x before
6.x-3.2 and 7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.0 for Drupal uses Drupal's token
scheme to restrict access to blocks, which makes it easier for remote
authenticated users to guess the access token for a block by
leveraging the token from a block to which the user has access.
