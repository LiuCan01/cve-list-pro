The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48
and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing
side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the
processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related
issue to CVE-2013-0169.
