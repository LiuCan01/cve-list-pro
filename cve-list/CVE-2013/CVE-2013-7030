** DISPUTED ** The TFTP service in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager (aka CUCM or Unified CM) allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information from a phone via an RRQ operation, as
demonstrated by discovering a cleartext UseUserCredential field in an
SPDefault.cnf.xml file.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the
significance of this report, stating that this is an expected default
behavior, and that the product's documentation describes use of the
TFTP Encrypted Config option in addressing this issue.
