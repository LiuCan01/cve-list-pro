The vm_map_lookup function in sys/vm/vm_map.c in the mmap
implementation in the kernel in FreeBSD 9.0 through 9.1-RELEASE-p4
does not properly determine whether a task should have write access to
a memory location, which allows local users to bypass filesystem write
permissions and consequently gain privileges via a crafted application
that leverages read permissions, and makes mmap and ptrace system
calls.
