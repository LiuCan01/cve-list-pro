Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 11 (JRE
1.7.0_11-b21) allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass the Java
security sandbox via unspecified vectors, aka "Issue 51," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2013-0431.  NOTE: as of 20130130, this
vulnerability does not contain any independently-verifiable details,
and there is no vendor acknowledgement. A CVE identifier is being
assigned because this vulnerability has received significant public
attention, and the original researcher has an established history of
releasing vulnerability reports that have been fixed by vendors.  NOTE:
this issue also exists in SE 6, but it cannot be exploited without a
separate vulnerability.
