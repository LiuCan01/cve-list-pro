The XrayWrapper implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 23.0 and
SeaMonkey before 2.20 does not properly address the possibility of an
XBL scope bypass resulting from non-native arguments in XBL function
calls, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging access to an
unprivileged object.
