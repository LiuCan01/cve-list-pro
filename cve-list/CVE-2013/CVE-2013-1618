The TLS implementation in Opera before 12.13 does not properly
consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check operation during
the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers
to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related
issue to CVE-2013-0169.
