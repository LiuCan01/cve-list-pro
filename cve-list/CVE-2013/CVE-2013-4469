OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana, when
use_cow_images is set to False, does not verify the virtual size of a
QCOW2 image, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
(host file system disk consumption) by transferring an image with a
large virtual size that does not contain a large amount of data from
Glance.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for
CVE-2013-2096.
