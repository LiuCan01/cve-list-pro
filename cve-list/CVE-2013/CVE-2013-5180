The srandomdev function in Libc in Apple Mac OS X before 10.9, when
the kernel random-number generator is unavailable, produces
predictable values instead of the intended random values, which makes
it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic
protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of these values, related
to a compiler-optimization issue.
