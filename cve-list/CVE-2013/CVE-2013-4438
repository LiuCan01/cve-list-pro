Reference: CONFIRM:http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/releases/0.17.1.html

Salt (aka SaltStack) before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary YAML code via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: the vendor states
that this might not be a vulnerability because the YAML to be loaded
has already been determined to be safe.
