** DISPUTED **

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Simple Machines
Forum (SMF) 1.1.4 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code
via a URL in the (1) settings[default_theme_dir] parameter to
Sources/Subs-Graphics.php and (2) settings[default_theme_dir]
parameter to Sources/Themes.php.  NOTE: CVE and multiple third parties
dispute this issue because the files contain a protection mechanism
against direct request.
