Buffer overflow in KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server 2.0.x allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via a long argument to an arbitrary command,
which triggers the overflow when the SamyFtp.binlog log file is viewed
in the management console.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2006-0441 and
CVE-2006-2212.
