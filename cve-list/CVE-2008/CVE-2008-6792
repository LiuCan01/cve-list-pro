system-tools-backends before 2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1 in Ubuntu 8.10, as used
by "Users and Groups" in GNOME System Tools, hashes account passwords
with 3DES and consequently limits effective password lengths to eight
characters, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
successfully conduct brute-force password attacks.
