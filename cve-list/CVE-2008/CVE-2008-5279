The Local ZIM Server (zcs.exe) in Zilab Chat and Instant Messaging
(ZIM) Server 2.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via (1) heap-based buffer overflows involving multiple
vectors including a long room name and a long source account, and (2)
a stack-based buffer overflow with a long username in an information
request.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
