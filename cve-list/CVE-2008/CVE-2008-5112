The LDAP server in Active Directory in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 and
Server 2003 SP1 and SP2 responds differently to a failed bind attempt
depending on whether the user account exists and is permitted to
login, which allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames via
a series of LDAP bind requests, as demonstrated by ldapuserenum.
