Double free vulnerability in the process_browse_data function in CUPS
1.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted UDP Browse
packets to the cupsd port (631/udp), related to an unspecified
manipulation of a remote printer.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
