Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Pluck CMS 4.5.2 on
Windows allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local
files via a .. (dot dot backslash) in the (1) blogpost, (2) cat, and
(3) file parameters to data/inc/themes/predefined_variables.php, as
reachable through index.php; and the (4) blogpost and (5) cat
parameters to data/inc/blog_include_react.php, as reachable through
index.php.  NOTE: the issue involving vectors 1 through 3 reportedly
exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-3194.
