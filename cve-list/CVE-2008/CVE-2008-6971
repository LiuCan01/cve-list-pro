The password reset functionality in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.0.x
before 1.0.14, 1.1.x before 1.1.6, and 2.0 before 2.0 beta 4 includes
clues about the random number generator state within a hidden form
field and generates predictable validation codes, which allows remote
attackers to modify passwords of other users and gain privileges.
