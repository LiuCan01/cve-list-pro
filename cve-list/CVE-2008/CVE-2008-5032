Stack-based buffer overflow in VideoLAN VLC media player 0.5.0 through
0.9.5 might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code
via the header of an invalid CUE image file, related to
modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c.  NOTE: this identifier originally included
an issue related to RealText, but that issue has been assigned a
separate identifier, CVE-2008-5036.
