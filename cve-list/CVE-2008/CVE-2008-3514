VMware VirtualCenter 2.5 before Update 2 and 2.0.2 before Update 5
relies on client-side "enabled/disabled functionality" for access
control, which allows remote attackers to determine valid user names
by enabling functionality in the GUI and then making an "attempt to
assign permissions to other system users."
