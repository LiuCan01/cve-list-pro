Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in WS-Proxy
in Eye-Fi 1.1.2 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of
users for requests that modify configuration via a SOAPAction
parameter of (1) urn:SetOptions for autostart, (2) urn:SetDesktopSync
for file upload, or (3) urn:SetFolderConfig for file download location
or modification of authentication credentials; and (4) urn:AddNetwork
for adding an arbitrary Service Set Identifier (SSID) to hijack the
image upload.
