SQL injection vulnerability in Load.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF)
1.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
commands by setting the db_character_set parameter to a multibyte
character set such as big5, which causes the addslashes PHP function
to produce a "" (backslash) sequence that does not quote the "'"
(single quote) character, as demonstrated via a manlabels action to
index.php.
