The WordPad Text Converter for Word 97 files in Microsoft Windows 2000
SP4, XP SP2, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2 allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) .doc, (2) .wri, or (3) .rtf
Word 97 file that triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild
in December 2008.  NOTE: As of 20081210, it is unclear whether this
vulnerability is related to a WordPad issue disclosed on 20080925 with
a 2008-crash.doc.rar example, but there are insufficient details to be
sure.
