Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
administrator/index2.php in MOStlyCE before 2.4, as used in Mambo
4.6.3 and earlier, allows remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of administrators for requests that add new
administrator accounts via the save task in a com_users action, as
demonstrated using a separate XSS vulnerability in
mambots/editors/mostlyce/jscripts/tiny_mce/filemanager/connectors/php/connector.php.
