Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/47668

xend in Xen 3.3.0 does not properly restrict a guest VM's write access
within the /local/domain xenstore directory tree, which allows guest
OS users to cause a denial of service and possibly have unspecified
other impact by writing to (1) console/tty, (2) console/limit, or (3)
image/device-model-pid.  NOTE: this issue exists because of erroneous
set_permissions calls in the fix for CVE-2008-4405.
