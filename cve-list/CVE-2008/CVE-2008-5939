Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in MODx CMS
0.9.6.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
script or HTML via a JavaScript event in the username field, possibly
related to snippet.ditto.php.  NOTE: some sources list the id
parameter as being affected, but this is probably incorrect based on
the original disclosure.
