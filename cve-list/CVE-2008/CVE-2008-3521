Reference: XF:jasper-jasstreamtmpfile-symlink(45622)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45622

Race condition in the jas_stream_tmpfile function in
libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (program exit) by creating the appropriate
tmp.XXXXXXXXXX temporary file, which causes Jasper to exit.  NOTE:
this was originally reported as a symlink issue, but this was
incorrect.  NOTE: some vendors dispute the severity of this issue, but
it satisfies CVE's requirements for inclusion.
