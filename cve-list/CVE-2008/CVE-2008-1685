** DISPUTED **

gcc 4.2.0 through 4.3.0 in GNU Compiler Collection, when casts are not
used, considers the sum of a pointer and an int to be greater than or
equal to the pointer, which might lead to removal of length testing
code that was intended as a protection mechanism against integer
overflow and buffer overflow attacks, and provide no diagnostic
message about this removal. NOTE: the vendor has determined that this
compiler behavior is correct according to section 6.5.6 of the C99
standard (aka ISO/IEC 9899:1999).
