Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the (a) "Unzip
archive" and (b) "Upload files and archives" functionality in net2ftp
0.96 stable and 0.97 beta allow remote attackers to create, read, or
delete arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in a filename within a (1)
TAR or (2) ZIP archive.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution
by creating a .php file.
