Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (heap corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code by triggering an error condition during certain Iframe
operations between a JSframe write and a JSframe close, as
demonstrated by an error in loading an empty Java applet defined by a
'src="javascript:"' sequence.
