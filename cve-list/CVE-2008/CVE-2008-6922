(4) MoveToInbox, (5) MoveToFolder, (6) DeleteMailEx, (7)
GetMailDataEx, (8) SetReplySign, (9) SetForwardSign, and (10)
SetReadSign methods, which are not properly handled by (a) the POP3
Class ActiveX control (CMailCom.POP3); or a long argument to the (11)
AddAttach, (12) SetSubject, (13) SetBcc, (14) SetBody, (15) SetCc,
(16) SetFrom, (17) SetTo, and (18) SetFromUID methods, which are not
