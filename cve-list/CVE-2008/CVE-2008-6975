Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
apply.cgi in DD-WRT 24 sp2 allow remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of administrators for requests that (1) execute
arbitrary commands via the ping_ip parameter; (2) change the
administrative credentials via the http_username and http_passwd
parameters; (3) enable remote administration via the remote_management
parameter; or (4) configure port forwarding via certain from, to, ip,
and pro parameters.  NOTE: This issue reportedly exists because of a
"weak ... anti-CSRF fix" implemented in 24 sp2.
