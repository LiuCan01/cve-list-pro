Off-by-one error in the
_web_drawInRect:withFont:ellipsis:alignment:measureOnly function in
WebKit in Safari in Apple iPhone 1.1.4 and 2.0 and iPod touch 1.1.4
and 2.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser
crash) via a JavaScript alert call with an argument that lacks
breakable characters and has a length that is a multiple of the memory
page size, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
