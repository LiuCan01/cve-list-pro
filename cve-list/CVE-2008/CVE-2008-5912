An unspecified function in the JavaScript implementation in Microsoft
Internet Explorer creates and exposes a "temporary footprint" when
there is a current login to a web site, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to trick a user into acting upon a spoofed pop-up
message, aka an "in-session phishing attack." NOTE: as of 20090116,
the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable
information. However, because it is from a well-known researcher, it
is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
