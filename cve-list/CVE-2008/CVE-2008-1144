The Marvell driver for the Netgear WN802T Wi-Fi access point with
firmware 1.3.16 on the Marvell 88W8361P-BEM1 chipset does not properly
parse EAPoL-Key packets, which allows remote authenticated users to
cause a denial of service (device reboot or hang) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a malformed EAPoL-Key packet with a crafted
"advertised length."
