Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/42842

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in BitKinex 2.9.3 allow
remote FTP and WebDAV servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files
via a .. (dot dot) in (1) a response to a LIST command from the
BitKinex FTP client and (2) a response to a PROPFIND command from the
BitKinex WebDAV client.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution
by writing to a Startup folder.
