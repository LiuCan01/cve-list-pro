ovalarmsrv in HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) 7.51, 7.53,
and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) via certain requests that specify a large number of
sub-arguments, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference due to memory
allocation failure.
