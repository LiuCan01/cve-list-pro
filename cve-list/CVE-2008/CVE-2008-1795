Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Blackboard
Academic Suite 7.x and earlier, and possibly some 8.0 versions, allow
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the
searchText parameter in a Course action to
webapps/blackboard/execute/viewCatalog or (2) the
data__announcements___pk1_pk2__subject parameter in an ADD action to
bin/common/announcement.pl.
