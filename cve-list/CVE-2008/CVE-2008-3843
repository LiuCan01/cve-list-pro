Request Validation (aka the ValidateRequest filters) in ASP.NET in
Microsoft .NET Framework with the MS07-040 update does not properly
detect dangerous client input, which allows remote attackers to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as demonstrated by a query
string containing a "<~/" (less-than tilde slash) sequence followed by
a crafted STYLE element.
