The Korn shell (aka mksh) before R33d on MirOS (aka MirBSD) does not
flush the tty's I/O when invoking mksh in a new terminal, which allows
local users to gain privileges by opening a virtual terminal and
entering command sequences, which might later be executed in
opportunistic circumstances by a different user who launches mksh and
specifies that terminal with the -T option.
