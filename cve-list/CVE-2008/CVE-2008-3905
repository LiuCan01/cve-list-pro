Reference: XF:ruby-resolv-dns-spoofing(45935)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45935

resolv.rb in Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p287, 1.8.7
before 1.8.7-p72, and 1.9 r18423 and earlier uses sequential
transaction IDs and constant source ports for DNS requests, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1447.
