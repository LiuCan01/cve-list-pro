Double free vulnerability in IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.1.0.0
through 6.1.0.15 allows remote authenticated administrators to cause a
denial of service (ABEND) and possibly execute arbitrary code by using
ldapadd to attempt to create a duplicate ibm-globalAdminGroup LDAP
database entry.  NOTE: the vendor states "There is no real risk of a
vulnerability," although there are likely scenarios in which a user is
allowed to make administrative LDAP requests but does not have the
privileges to stop the server.
