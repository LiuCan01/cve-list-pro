Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 on Cisco 10000, uBR10012 and uBR7200
series devices handles external UDP packets that are sent to
127.0.0.0/8 addresses intended for IPC communication within the
device, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(device or linecard reload) via crafted UDP packets, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2008-3805.
