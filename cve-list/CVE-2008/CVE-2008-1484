The password reset feature in PunBB 1.2.16 and earlier uses
predictable random numbers based on the system time, which allows
remote authenticated users to determine the new password via a brute
force attack on a seed that is based on the approximate creation time
of the targeted account.  NOTE: this issue might be related to
CVE-2006-5737.
