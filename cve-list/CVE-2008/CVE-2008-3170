Apple Safari allows web sites to set cookies for country-specific
top-level domains, such as co.uk and com.au, which could allow remote
attackers to perform a session fixation attack and hijack a user's
HTTP session, aka "Cross-Site Cooking," a related issue to
CVE-2004-0746, CVE-2004-0866, and CVE-2004-0867.
