Apple QuickTime before 7.5.5 does not properly handle (1) MDAT atoms
in MP4 video files within QuickTimeH264.qtx, (2) MDAT atoms in mov
video files within QuickTimeH264.scalar, and (3) AVC1 atoms in an
unknown media type within an unspecified component, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (heap corruption and application crash) via a crafted, H.264
encoded movie file.
