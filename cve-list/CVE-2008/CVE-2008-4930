MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.4.2 does not properly handle an uploaded
file with a nonstandard file type that contains HTML sequences, which
allows remote attackers to cause that file to be processed as HTML by
Internet Explorer's content inspection, aka "Incomplete protection
against MIME-sniffing." NOTE: this could be leveraged for XSS and
other attacks.
