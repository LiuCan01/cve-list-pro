Stack-based buffer overflow in the _lib_spawn_user_getpid function in
(1) swatch.exe and (2) surgemail.exe in NetWin SurgeMail 38k4 and
earlier, and beta 39a, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an HTTP
request with multiple long headers to webmail.exe and unspecified
other CGI executables, which triggers an overflow when assigning
values to environment variables.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
