editors, (2) during local group creation, (3) during HTML redirects,
(4) in the HTML import, (5) in the Rich text editor, and (6) in
link-page in IBM Lotus Quickr 8.1 services for Lotus Domino before
Hotfix 15 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or

vulnerability in the WYSIWYG editors may exist because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2163.
