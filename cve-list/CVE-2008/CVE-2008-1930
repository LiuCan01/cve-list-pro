The cookie authentication method in WordPress 2.5 relies on a hash of
a concatenated string containing USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME, which
allows remote attackers to forge cookies by registering a username
that results in the same concatenated string, as demonstrated by
registering usernames beginning with "admin" to obtain administrator
privileges, aka a "cryptographic splicing" issue.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6013.
