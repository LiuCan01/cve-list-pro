Multiple heap-based buffer underflows in the ReadPALMImage function in
coders/palm.c in GraphicsMagick before 1.2.3 allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
via a crafted PALM image, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2007-0770.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
