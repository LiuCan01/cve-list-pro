Cross-domain vulnerability in the WorkerPool API in Google Gears
before 0.5.4.2 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
Policy and the intended access restrictions of the allowCrossOrigin
function by hosting an assumed-safe file type containing Google Gear
commands on the target domain, then accessing that file from the
attacking domain, whose response headers are not checked and cause the
worker code to run in the target domain.
