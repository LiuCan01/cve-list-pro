The strong name (SN) implementation in Microsoft .NET Framework
2.0.50727 relies on the digital signature Public Key Token embedded in
the pathname of a DLL file instead of the digital signature of this
file itself, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass Global
Assembly Cache (GAC) and Code Access Security (CAS) protection
mechanisms, aka MSRC ticket MSRC8566gs.
