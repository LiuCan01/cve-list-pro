Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the add2 action in
a_upload.php in OneCMS 2.4, and possibly earlier, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an
executable extension and using a safe content type such as image/gif,
then accessing it via a direct request to the file in an unspecified
directory.
