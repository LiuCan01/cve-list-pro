A certain pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm that uses
XOR and 3-bit random hops (aka "Algorithm X3"), as used in OpenBSD 2.8
through 4.2, allows remote attackers to guess sensitive values such as
DNS transaction IDs by observing a sequence of previously generated
values.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged for attacks such as DNS
cache poisoning against OpenBSD's modification of BIND.
