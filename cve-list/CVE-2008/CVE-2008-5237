Multiple integer overflows in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and
earlier versions, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted width and
height values that are not validated by the mymng_process_header
function in demux_mng.c before use in an allocation calculation or (2)
crafted current_atom_size and string_size values processed by the
parse_reference_atom function in demux_qt.c for an RDRF_ATOM string.
