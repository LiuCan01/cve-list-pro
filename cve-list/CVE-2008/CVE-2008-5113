WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain
dangerous situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
conduct delayed and persistent cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1)
delete user accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of
application access).  NOTE: this issue relies on the presence of an
independent vulnerability that allows cookie injection.
