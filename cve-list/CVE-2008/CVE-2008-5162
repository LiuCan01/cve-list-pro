The arc4random function in the kernel in FreeBSD 6.3 through 7.1 does
not have a proper entropy source for a short time period immediately
after boot, which makes it easier for attackers to predict the
function's return values and conduct certain attacks against the GEOM
framework and various network protocols, related to the Yarrow random
number generator.
