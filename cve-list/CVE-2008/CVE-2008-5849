Check Point VPN-1 R55, R65, and other versions, when Port Address
Translation (PAT) is used, allows remote attackers to discover
intranet IP addresses via a packet with a small TTL, which triggers an
ICMP_TIMXCEED_INTRANS (aka ICMP time exceeded in-transit) response
containing an encapsulated IP packet with an intranet address, as
demonstrated by a TCP packet to the firewall management server on port
18264.
