PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
lib/jpgraph/jpgraph_errhandler.inc.php in Sandbox 1.4.1 might allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via unspecified
vectors.  NOTE: the issue, if any, may be located in Aditus JpGraph
rather than Sandbox. If so, then this should not be treated as an
issue in Sandbox.
