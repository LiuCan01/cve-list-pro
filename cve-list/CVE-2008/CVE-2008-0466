Web Wiz RTE_file_browser.asp in, as used in Web Wiz Rich Text Editor
4.0, Web Wiz Forums 9.07, and Web Wiz Newspad 1.02, does not require
authentication, which allows remote attackers to list directories and
read files.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for listings outside the
configured directory tree by exploiting a separate directory traversal
vulnerability.
