Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/40837

Directory traversal vulnerability in the Shared Folders feature for
VMWare ACE 1.0.2 and 2.0.2, Player 1.0.4 and 2.0.2, and Workstation
5.5.4 and 6.0.2 allows guest OS users to read and write arbitrary
files on the host OS via a multibyte string that produces a wide
character string containing .. (dot dot) sequences, which bypasses the
protection mechanism, as demonstrated using a "%c0%2e%c0%2e" string.
