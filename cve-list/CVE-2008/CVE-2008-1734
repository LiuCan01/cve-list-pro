Interpretation conflict in PHP Toolkit before 1.0.1 on Gentoo Linux
might allow local users to cause a denial of service (PHP outage) and
read contents of PHP scripts by creating a file with a one-letter
lowercase alphabetic name, which triggers interpretation of a certain
unquoted [a-z] argument as a matching shell glob for this name, rather
than interpretation as the literal [a-z] regular-expression string,
and consequently blocks the launch of the PHP interpreter within the
Apache HTTP Server.
