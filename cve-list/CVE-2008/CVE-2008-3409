Buffer overflow in Unreal Tournament 3 1.3beta4 and earlier allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a UDP packet
containing a large value in a certain size field, followed by a data
string of that size, aka attack 1 in ut3mendo.c.
