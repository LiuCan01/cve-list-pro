lib/Driver/sql.php in Turba 2 (turba2) Contact Manager H3 2.1.x before
2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2-RC3, as used in products such as Horde
Groupware before 1.0.4 and Horde Groupware Webmail Edition before
1.0.5, does not properly check access rights, which allows remote
authenticated users to modify address data via a modified object_id
parameter to edit.php, as demonstrated by modifying a personal address
book entry when there is write access to a shared address book.
