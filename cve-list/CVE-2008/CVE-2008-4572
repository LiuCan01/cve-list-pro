GuildFTPd 0.999.14, and possibly other versions, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via long arguments to the CWD and LIST commands, which
triggers heap corruption related to an improper free call, and
possibly triggering a heap-based buffer overflow.
