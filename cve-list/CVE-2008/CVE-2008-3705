Stack-based buffer overflow in the CLogger::WriteFormated function in
echoware/Logger.cpp in EchoVNC Linux before 1.1.2 allows remote
echoServers to execute arbitrary code via a large (1) group or (2)
user list, aka a "very crowded echoServer" attack.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
