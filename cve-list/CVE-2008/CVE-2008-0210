Uebimiau Webmail 2.7.10 and 2.7.2 does not protect authentication
state variables from being set through HTTP requests, which allows
remote attackers to bypass authentication via a sess[auth]=1 parameter
settting.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to conduct directory traversal
attacks without authentication by using CVE-2008-0140.
