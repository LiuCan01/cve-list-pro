SLnet.exe in SeattleLab SLNet RF Telnet Server 4.1.1.3758 and earlier
allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via unspecified telnet options, which triggers a NULL pointer
dereference.  NOTE: the crash is not user-assisted when the server is
running in debug mode.
