Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in ErfurtWiki R1.02b and
earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to
include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the
(1) ewiki_id and (2) ewiki_action parameters to fragments/css.php, and
possibly the (3) id parameter to the default URI.  NOTE: the default
URI is site-specific but often performs an include_once of ewiki.php.
