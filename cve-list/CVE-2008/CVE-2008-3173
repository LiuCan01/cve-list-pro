Microsoft Internet Explorer allows web sites to set cookies for
domains that have a public suffix with more than one dot character,
which could allow remote attackers to perform a session fixation
attack and hijack a user's HTTP session, aka "Cross-Site Cooking."
NOTE: this issue may exist because of an insufficient fix for
CVE-2004-0866.
