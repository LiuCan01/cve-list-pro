The Web management interface in Avaya SIP Enablement Services (SES)
3.x and 4.0, as used with Avaya Communication Manager 3.1.x, does not
perform authentication for certain functionality, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information and access restricted
functionality via (1) the certificate installation utility, (2)
unspecified scripts in the objects folder, (3) an "unnecessary default
application," (4) unspecified scripts in the states folder, (5) an
unspecified "default application" that lists server configuration, and
(6) "full system help."
