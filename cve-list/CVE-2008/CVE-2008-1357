Format string vulnerability in the logDetail function of applib.dll in
McAfee Common Management Agent (CMA) 3.6.0.574 (Patch 3) and earlier,
as used in ePolicy Orchestrator 4.0.0 build 1015, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary
code via format string specifiers in a sender field in an AgentWakeup
request to UDP port 8082.  NOTE: this issue only exists when the debug
level is 8.
