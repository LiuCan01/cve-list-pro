The load function in the XPM loader for imlib2 1.4.2, and possibly
other versions, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted XPM file that
triggers a "pointer arithmetic error" and a heap-based buffer
overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-2426.
