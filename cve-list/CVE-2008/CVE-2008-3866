The Trend Micro Personal Firewall service (aka TmPfw.exe) in Trend
Micro Network Security Component (NSC) modules, as used in Trend Micro
OfficeScan 8.0 SP1 Patch 1 and Internet Security 2007 and 2008
17.0.1224, relies on client-side password protection implemented in
the configuration GUI, which allows local users to bypass intended
access restrictions and change firewall settings by using a modified
client to send crafted packets.
