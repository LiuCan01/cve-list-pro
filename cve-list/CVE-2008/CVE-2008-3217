PowerDNS Recursor before 3.1.6 does not always use the strongest
random number generator for source port selection, which makes it
easier for remote attack vectors to conduct DNS cache poisoning.  NOTE:
this is related to incomplete integration of security improvements
associated with addressing CVE-2008-1637.
