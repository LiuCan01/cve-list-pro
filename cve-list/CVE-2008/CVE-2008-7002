PHP 5.2.5 does not enforce (a) open_basedir and (b) safe_mode_exec_dir
restrictions for certain functions, which might allow local users to
bypass intended access restrictions and call programs outside of the
intended directory via the (1) exec, (2) system, (3) shell_exec, (4)
passthru, or (5) popen functions, possibly involving pathnames such as
"C:" drive notation.
