Stack-based buffer overflow in the file parsing function in Tonec
Internet Download Manager, possibly 5.14 and earlier, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted AppleDouble file containing a long
string.  NOTE: this is probably a different vulnerability than
CVE-2005-2210.
