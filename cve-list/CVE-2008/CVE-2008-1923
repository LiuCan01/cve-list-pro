The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk 1.2 before revision
72630 and 1.4 before revision 65679, when configured to allow
unauthenticated calls, sends "early audio" to an unverified source IP
address of a NEW message, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed NEW message.
