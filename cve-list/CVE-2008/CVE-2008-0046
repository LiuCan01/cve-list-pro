The Application Firewall in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.2 has an incorrect
German translation for the "Set access for specific services and
applications" radio button that might cause the user to believe that
the button is used to restrict access only to specific services and
applications, which might allow attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions.
