The Logging Server (ftplogsrv.exe) 7.9.14.0 and earlier in IPSwitch
WS_FTP 6.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loss
of responsiveness) via a large number of large packets to port
5151/udp, which causes the listening socket to terminate and prevents
log commands from being recorded, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2007-3823.
