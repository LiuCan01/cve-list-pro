Pragma FortressSSH 5.0 Build 4 Revision 293 and earlier handles long
input to sshd.exe by creating an error-message window and waiting for
the administrator to click in this window before terminating the
sshd.exe process, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (connection slot exhaustion) via a flood of SSH connections
with long data objects, as demonstrated by (1) a long list of keys and
(2) a long username.
