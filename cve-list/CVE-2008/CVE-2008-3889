Postfix 2.4 before 2.4.9, 2.5 before 2.5.5, and 2.6 before
2.6-20080902, when used with the Linux 2.6 kernel, leaks epoll file
descriptors during execution of "non-Postfix" commands, which allows
local users to cause a denial of service (application slowdown or
exit) via a crafted command, as demonstrated by a command in a
.forward file.
