The NeffyLauncher 1.0.5 ActiveX control (NeffyLauncher.dll) in
CDNetworks Nefficient Download uses weak cryptography for a KeyCode
that blocks unauthorized use of the control, which allows remote
attackers to bypass this protection mechanism by calculating the
required KeyCode.  NOTE: this can be used by arbitrary web sites to
host exploit code that targets this control.
