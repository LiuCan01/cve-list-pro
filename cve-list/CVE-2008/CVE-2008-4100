GNU adns 1.4 and earlier uses a fixed source port and sequential
transaction IDs for DNS requests, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to spoof DNS responses, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2008-1447.  NOTE: the vendor reports that this is intended behavior
and is compatible with the product's intended role in a trusted
environment.
