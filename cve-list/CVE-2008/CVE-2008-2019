Simple Machines Forum (SMF), probably 1.1.4, relies on "randomly
generated static" to hinder brute-force attacks on the WAV file (aka
audio) CAPTCHA, which allows remote attackers to pass the CAPTCHA test
via an automated attack that considers Hamming distances.  NOTE: this
issue reportedly exists because of an insufficient fix for
CVE-2007-3308.
