The DataGrid ActiveX control in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and Visual
FoxPro 8.0 SP1 and 9.0 SP1 and SP2 does not properly handle errors
during access to incorrectly initialized objects, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document,
related to corruption of the "system state," aka "DataGrid Control
Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
