ExtremeZ-IP.exe in ExtremeZ-IP File and Print Server 5.1.2x15 and
earlier does not verify that a certain "number of URLs" field is
consistent with the packet length, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a large integer in this
field in a packet to the Service Location Protocol (SLP) service on
UDP port 427, triggering an out-of-bounds read.
