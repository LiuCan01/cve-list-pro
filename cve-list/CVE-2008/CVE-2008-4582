Mozilla Firefox 3.0.1 through 3.0.3, Firefox 2.x before 2.0.0.18, and
SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.13, when running on Windows, do not properly
identify the context of Windows .url shortcut files, which allows
user-assisted remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and
obtain sensitive information via an HTML document that is directly
accessible through a filesystem, as demonstrated by documents in (1)
local folders, (2) Windows share folders, and (3) RAR archives, and as
demonstrated by IFRAMEs referencing shortcuts that point to (a)
about:cache?device=memory and (b) about:cache?device=disk, a variant
of CVE-2008-2810.
