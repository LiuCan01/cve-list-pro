Microsoft Office Word 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, 2003 SP3, and 2007 Gold and
SP1; Outlook 2007 Gold and SP1; Word Viewer 2003 Gold and SP3; and
Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File
Formats Gold and SP1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via crafted control words in (1) an RTF file or (2) a rich text e-mail
message, which triggers incorrect memory allocation and memory
corruption, aka "Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability," a different
vulnerability than CVE-2008-4028.
