The IAX2 protocol implementation in Asterisk Open Source 1.0.x, 1.2.x
before 1.2.30, and 1.4.x before 1.4.21.2; Business Edition A.x.x,
B.x.x before B.2.5.4, and C.x.x before C.1.10.3; AsteriskNOW;
Appliance Developer Kit 0.x.x; and s800i 1.0.x before 1.2.0.1 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (call-number exhaustion
and CPU consumption) by quickly sending a large number of IAX2 (IAX)
POKE requests.
