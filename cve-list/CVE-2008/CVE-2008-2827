Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/43308

The rmtree function in lib/File/Path.pm in Perl 5.10 does not properly
check permissions before performing a chmod, which allows local users
to modify the permissions of arbitrary files via a symlink attack, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0448 and CVE-2004-0452.
