Integer overflow in the inet_net_pton API in Libsystem in Apple Mac OS
X before 10.5.6 allows context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this may be related to the WLB-2008080064
advisory published by SecurityReason on 20080822; however, as of
20081216, there are insufficient details to be sure.
