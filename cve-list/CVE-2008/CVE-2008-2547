Stack-based buffer overflow in msiexec.exe 3.1.4000.1823 and
4.5.6001.22159 in Microsoft Windows Installer allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long GUID value for the /x
(aka /uninstall) option.  NOTE: this issue might cross privilege
boundaries if msiexec.exe is reachable via components such as ActiveX
controls, and might additionally require a separate vulnerability in
the control.
