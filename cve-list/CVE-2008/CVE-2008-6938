Pi3Web 2.0.3 before PL2, when installed on Windows as a desktop
application and without using the Pi3Web/Conf/Intenet.pi3, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) and
obtain the full pathname of the server via a request to a file in the
ISAPI directory that is not an executable DLL, which triggers the
crash when the DLL load fails, as demonstrated using Isapiusers.txt.
