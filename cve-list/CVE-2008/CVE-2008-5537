PC Tools AntiVirus 4.4.2.0, when Internet Explorer 6 or 7 is used,
allows remote attackers to bypass detection of malware in an HTML
document by placing an MZ header (aka "EXE info") at the beginning,
and modifying the filename to have (1) no extension, (2) a .txt
extension, or (3) a .jpg extension, as demonstrated by a document
containing a CVE-2006-5745 exploit.
