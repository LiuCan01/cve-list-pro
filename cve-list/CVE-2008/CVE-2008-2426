Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Imlib 2 (aka imlib2) 1.4.0
allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a PNM image with a
crafted header, related to the load function in
src/modules/loaders/loader_pnm.c; or (2) a crafted XPM image, related
to the load function in src/modules/loader_xpm.c.
