Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the File Manager in the
admin panel in Twentyone Degrees Symphony 1.7.01 and earlier allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an
executable extension to a directory specified in the destination
parameter, then accessing the uploaded file via a direct request, as
demonstrated using workspace/masters/.
