Multiple absolute path traversal vulnerabilities in certain ActiveX
controls in WatchFire AppScan 7.0 allow remote attackers to create or
overwrite arbitrary files via a full pathname in the argument to the
(1) CompactSave and (2) SaveSession method in one control, and the (3)
saveRecordedExploreToFile method in a different control.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
