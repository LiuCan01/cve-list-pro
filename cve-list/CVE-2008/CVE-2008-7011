The Unreal engine, as used in Unreal Tournament 3 1.3, Unreal
Tournament 2003 and 2004, Dead Man's Hand, Pariah, WarPath, Postal2,
and Shadow Ops, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (server exit) via multiple file downloads from the server,
which triggers an assertion failure when the Closing flag in
UnChan.cpp is set.
