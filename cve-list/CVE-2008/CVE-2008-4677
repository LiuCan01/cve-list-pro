autoload/netrw.vim (aka the Netrw Plugin) 109, 131, and other versions
before 133k for Vim 7.1.266, other 7.1 versions, and 7.2 stores
credentials for an FTP session, and sends those credentials when
attempting to establish subsequent FTP sessions to servers on
different hosts, which allows remote FTP servers to obtain sensitive
information in opportunistic circumstances by logging usernames and
passwords.  NOTE: the upstream vendor disputes a vector involving
different ports on the same host, stating "I'm assuming that they're
using the same id and password on that unchanged hostname,
deliberately."
