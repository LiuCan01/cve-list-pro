PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in view_func.php in Member
Area System (MAS) 1.7 and possibly others allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the i parameter.  NOTE: a
second vector might exist via the l parameter.  NOTE: as of 20080118,
the vendor has disputed the set of affected versions, stating that the
issue "is already fixed, for almost a year."
