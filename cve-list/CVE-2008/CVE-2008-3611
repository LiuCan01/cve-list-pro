Login Window in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.11 does not clear the current
password when a user makes a password-change attempt that is denied by
policy, which allows opportunistic, physically proximate attackers to
bypass authentication and change this user's password by later
entering an acceptable new password on the same login screen.
