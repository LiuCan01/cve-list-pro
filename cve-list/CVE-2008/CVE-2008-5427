Norton Antivirus in Norton Internet Security 15.5.0.23 does not
properly handle (1) multipart/mixed e-mail messages with many MIME
parts and possibly (2) e-mail messages with many "Content-type:
message/rfc822;" headers, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (stack consumption or other resource consumption)
via a large e-mail message, a related issue to CVE-2006-1173.
