ParametersInterceptor in OpenSymphony XWork 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and
2.1.x before 2.1.2, as used in Apache Struts and other products, does
not properly restrict # (pound sign) references to context objects,
which allows remote attackers to execute Object-Graph Navigation
Language (OGNL) statements and modify server-side context objects, as
demonstrated by use of a u0023 representation for the # character.
