PatchLink Update client for Unix, as used by Novell ZENworks Patch
Management Update Agent for Linux/Unix/Mac (LUM) 6.2094 through 6.4102
and other products, allows local users to (1) truncate arbitrary files
via a symlink attack on the /tmp/patchlink.tmp file used by the
logtrimmer script, and (2) execute arbitrary code via a symlink attack
on the /tmp/plshutdown file used by the rebootTask script.
