Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 and
10.2.0.3 have unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors
related to (1) SDO_UTIL in the Oracle Spatial component, aka DB05; or
(2) fine grained auditing in the Audit component, aka DB14.  NOTE: the
previous information was obtained from the Oracle CPU.  Oracle has not
commented on reliable researcher claims that DB05 is SQL injection.
