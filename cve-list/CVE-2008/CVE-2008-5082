The verifyProof function in the Token Processing System (TPS)
component in Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) 7.1 through 7.3 and
Dogtag Certificate System 1.0 returns successfully even when token
enrollment did not use the hardware key, which allows remote
authenticated users with enrollment privileges to bypass intended
authentication policies by performing enrollment with a software key.
