Stack-based buffer overflow in the msx_readnode function in libmosix.c
in openmosix-tools (aka userspace-tools) in openMosix might allow
local users to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a
third-party program that calls this function with a long item
argument.  NOTE: the vendor does not provide any program that is
capable of causing this overflow.
