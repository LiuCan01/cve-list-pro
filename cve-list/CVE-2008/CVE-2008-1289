Multiple buffer overflows in Asterisk Open Source 1.4.x before
1.4.18.1 and 1.4.19-rc3, Open Source 1.6.x before 1.6.0-beta6,
Business Edition C.x.x before C.1.6.1, AsteriskNOW 1.0.x before 1.0.2,
Appliance Developer Kit before 1.4 revision 109386, and s800i 1.1.x
before 1.1.0.2 allow remote attackers to (1) write a zero to an
arbitrary memory location via a large RTP payload number, related to
the ast_rtp_unset_m_type function in main/rtp.c; or (2) write certain
integers to an arbitrary memory location via a large number of RTP
payloads, related to the process_sdp function in channels/chan_sip.c.
