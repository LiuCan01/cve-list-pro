Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.0 on HTC Wiza 200 and HTC MDA 8125 devices
does not properly handle the first attempt to establish a Bluetooth
connection to a peer with a long name, which allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (device reboot) by configuring a
Bluetooth device with a long hci name and (1) connecting directly to
the Windows Mobile system or (2) waiting for the Windows Mobile system
to scan for nearby devices.
