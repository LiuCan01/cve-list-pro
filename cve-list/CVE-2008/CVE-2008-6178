Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in
editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/php/connector.php in
FCKeditor 2.2, as used in Falt4 CMS, Nuke ET, and other products,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating a file
with PHP sequences preceded by a ZIP header, uploading this file via a
FileUpload action with the application/zip content type, and then
accessing this file via a direct request to the file in
UserFiles/File/, probably a related issue to CVE-2005-4094.  NOTE: some
of these details are obtained from third party information.
