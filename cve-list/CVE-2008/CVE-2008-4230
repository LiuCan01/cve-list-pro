The Passcode Lock feature in Apple iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.1 and
iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.1 displays SMS messages when
the emergency-call screen is visible, which allows physically
proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading these
messages.  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2008-4593.
