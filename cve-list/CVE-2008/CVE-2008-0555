The ExpandCert function in Apache-SSL before apache_1.3.41+ssl_1.59
does not properly handle (1) '/' and (2) '=' characters in a
Distinguished Name (DN) in a client certificate, which might allow
remote attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted DN that
triggers overwriting of environment variables.
