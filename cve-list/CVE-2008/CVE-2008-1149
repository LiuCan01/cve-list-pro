Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/40968

phpMyAdmin before 2.11.5 accesses $_REQUEST to obtain some parameters
instead of $_GET and $_POST, which allows attackers in the same domain
to override certain variables and conduct SQL injection and Cross-Site
Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by using crafted cookies.
