The Replace function in the capp-lspp-config script in the (1)
lspp-eal4-config-ibm and (2) capp-lspp-eal4-config-hp packages before
0.65-2 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 uses lstat instead of stat
to determine the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file permissions, leading to a
change to world-writable permissions for the /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac
file, which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying this
file.
