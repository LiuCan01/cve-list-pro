MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.4.3 includes the sensitive my_post_key
parameter in URLs to moderation.php with the (1) mergeposts, (2)
split, and (3) deleteposts actions, which allows remote attackers to
steal the token and bypass the cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
protection mechanism to hijack the authentication of moderators by
reading the token from the HTTP Referer header.
