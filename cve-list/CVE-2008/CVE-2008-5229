Stack-based buffer overflow in Microsoft Device IO Control in
iphlpapi.dll in Microsoft Windows Vista Gold and SP1 allows local
users in the Network Configuration Operator group to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service (system crash) via a large invalid
PrefixLength to the CreateIpForwardEntry2 method, as demonstrated by a
"route add" command.  NOTE: this issue might not cross privilege
boundaries.
