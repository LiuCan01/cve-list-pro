RSMScript 1.21 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and
gain administrative privileges by setting the verified cookie to an
arbitrary value and performing a direct request to (1) delete.php, (2)
edit-submit.php, (3) edit.php, (4) submit.php, and (5) update.php,
which bypasses the security check that is performed by verify.php.
