PyDNS (aka python-dns) before 2.3.1-5 in Debian GNU/Linux does not use
random source ports for DNS requests and does not use random
transaction IDs for DNS retries, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to spoof DNS responses, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2008-1447.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4099.
