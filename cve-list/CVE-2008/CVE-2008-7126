Integer overflow in osagent.exe in Borland VisiBroker Smart Agent
08.00.00.C1.03 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
packet with a large string length value to UDP port 14000, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
