** DISPUTED **

The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 does not
recognize attack patterns designed to operate against web pages that
are encoded with utf-7, which allows remote attackers to bypass the
XSS protection mechanism and conduct XSS attacks by injecting crafted
utf-7 content.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes this issue,
stating "Behaviour is by design."
