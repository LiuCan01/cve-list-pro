ProFTPD 1.3.1 interprets long commands from an FTP client as multiple
commands, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) attacks and execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long
ftp:// URI that leverages an existing session from the FTP client
implementation in a web browser.
