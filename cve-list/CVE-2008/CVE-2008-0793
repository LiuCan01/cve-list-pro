Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in search.asp in
Tendenci CMS allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via the (1) category, (2) searchtext, (3) jobcategoryid, (4)
contactcompany, and unspecified other parameters.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: it is not
clear whether this affects Tendenci Enterprise Edition in addition to
the product's deployment on Tendenci's own server farm. If only the
latter was affected, then this issue should not be included in CVE.
