The menu system in Drupal 6 before 6.2 has incorrect menu settings,
which allows remote attackers to (1) edit the profile pages of
arbitrary users, and obtain sensitive information from (2) tracker and
(3) blog pages, related to a missing check for the "access content"
permission; and (4) allows remote authenticated users, with
administration page view access, to edit content types.
