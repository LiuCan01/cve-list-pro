Mobile Safari on Apple iPhone 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion and device crash) via
certain JavaScript code that constructs a long string and an array
containing long string elements, possibly a related issue to
CVE-2006-3677.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
