Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/42765

Apple Safari on Mac OS X, and before 3.1.2 on Windows, does not prompt
the user before downloading an object that has an unrecognized content
type, which allows remote attackers to place malware into the (1)
Desktop directory on Windows or (2) Downloads directory on Mac OS X,
and subsequently allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
Windows by leveraging an untrusted search path vulnerability in (a)
Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP or (b) the SearchPath function in
Windows XP, Vista, and Server 2003 and 2008, aka a "Carpet Bomb" and a
"Blended Threat Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability," a different
issue than CVE-2008-1032. NOTE: Apple considers this a vulnerability
only because the Microsoft products can load application libraries
from the desktop and, as of 20080619, has not covered the issue in an
advisory for Mac OS X.
