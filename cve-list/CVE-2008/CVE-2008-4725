Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Opera.dll in Opera 9.52
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
query string, which is not properly escaped before storage in the
History Search database (aka md.dat), a different vector than
CVE-2008-4696.  NOTE: some of these issues were addressed before 9.60.
