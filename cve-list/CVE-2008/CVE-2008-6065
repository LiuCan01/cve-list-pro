Oracle Database Server 10.1, 10.2, and 11g grants directory WRITE
permissions for arbitrary pathnames that are aliased in a CREATE OR
REPLACE DIRECTORY statement, which allows remote authenticated users
with CREATE ANY DIRECTORY privileges to gain SYSDBA privileges by
aliasing the pathname of the password directory, and then overwriting
the password file through UTL_FILE operations, a related issue to
CVE-2006-7141.
