The control panel on the Belkin F5D7230-4 router with firmware 9.01.10
maintains authentication state by IP address, which allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication by establishing a session from a
source IP address of a previously authenticated user, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2005-3802.
