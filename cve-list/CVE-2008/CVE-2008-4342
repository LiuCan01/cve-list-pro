possibly other products, allows remote attackers to overwrite and
create arbitrary files via calls to the EnableLog and LogMessage
methods. NOTE: this issue might only be exploitable in limited
environments or non-default browser settings. NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information. NOTE: this can be
leveraged for remote code execution by accessing files using hcp://
URLs.
