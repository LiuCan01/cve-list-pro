pkcs15-tool in OpenSC before 0.11.6 does not apply security updates to
a smart card unless the card's label matches the "OpenSC" string,
which might allow physically proximate attackers to exploit
vulnerabilities that the card owner expected were patched, as
demonstrated by exploitation of CVE-2008-2235.
