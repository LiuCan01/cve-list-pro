Cross-domain vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7
allows remote attackers to change the location property of a frame via
the String data type, and use a frame from a different domain to
observe domain-independent events, as demonstrated by observing
onkeydown events with caballero-listener.  NOTE: according to
Microsoft, this is a duplicate of CVE-2008-2947, possibly a
different attack vector.
