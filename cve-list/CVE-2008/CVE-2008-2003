BadBlue 2.72 Personal Edition stores multiple programs in the web
document root with insufficient access control, which allows remote
attackers to (1) cause a denial of service via multiple invocations of
uninst.exe, and have an unknown impact via (2) badblue.exe and (3)
dyndns.exe.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for arbitrary remote code
execution in conjunction with CVE-2007-6378.
