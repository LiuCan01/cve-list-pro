Cisco Secure ACS 3.x before 3.3(4) Build 12 patch 7, 4.0.x, 4.1.x
before 4.1(4) Build 13 Patch 11, and 4.2.x before 4.2(0) Build 124
Patch 4 does not properly handle an EAP Response packet in which the
value of the length field exceeds the actual packet length, which
allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
(CSRadius and CSAuth service crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
via a crafted RADIUS (1) EAP-Response/Identity, (2) EAP-Response/MD5,
or (3) EAP-Response/TLS Message Attribute packet.
