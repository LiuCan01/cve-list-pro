lib/viewvc.py in ViewVC 1.0.5 uses the content-type parameter in the
HTTP request for the Content-Type header in the HTTP response, which
allows remote attackers to cause content to be misinterpreted by the
browser via a content-type parameter that is inconsistent with the
requested object.  NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since
it requires attacker access to the repository that is being viewed.
