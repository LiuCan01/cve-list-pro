Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pmd_pdf.php in phpMyAdmin
3.0.0, and possibly other versions including 2.11.9.2 and 3.0.1, when
register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the db parameter, a different vector
than CVE-2006-6942 and CVE-2007-5977.
