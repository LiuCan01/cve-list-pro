Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 relies on the
XDomainRequestAllowed HTTP header to authorize data exchange between
domains, which allows remote attackers to bypass the product's XSS
Filter protection mechanism, and conduct XSS and cross-domain attacks,
by injecting this header after a CRLF sequence, related to
"XDomainRequest Allowed Injection (XAI)." NOTE: the vendor has
reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt
to "address every conceivable XSS attack scenario."
