lynx 2.8.6dev.15 and earlier, when advanced mode is enabled and lynx
is configured as a URL handler, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands via a crafted lynxcgi: URL, a related issue to
CVE-2005-2929.  NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability in limited
deployments that have defined a lynxcgi: handler.
