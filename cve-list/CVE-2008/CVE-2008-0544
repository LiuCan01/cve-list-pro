Heap-based buffer overflow in the IMG_LoadLBM_RW function in IMG_lbm.c
in SDL_image before 1.2.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
crafted IFF ILBM file.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
third party information.
