Interpretation conflict in Drupal 4.7.x before 4.7.11 and 5.x before
5.6, when Internet Explorer 6 is used, allows remote attackers to
conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via invalid UTF-8 byte
sequences, which are not processed as UTF-8 by Drupal's HTML
filtering, but are processed as UTF-8 by Internet Explorer,
effectively removing characters from the document and defeating the
HTML protection mechanism.
