Oracle Application Server (OracleAS) Portal 10g allows remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read the contents
of /dav_portal/portal/ by sending a request containing a trailing
"%0A" (encoded line feed), then using the session ID that is generated
from that request.  NOTE: as of 20080512, Oracle has not commented on
the accuracy of this report.
