qiomkfile in the Quick I/O for Database feature in Symantec Veritas
File System (VxFS) on HP-UX, and before 5.0 MP3 on Solaris, Linux, and
AIX, does not initialize filesystem blocks during creation of a file,
which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by creating
and then reading files.
