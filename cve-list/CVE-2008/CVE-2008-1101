Buffer overflow in kvdocve.dll in the KeyView document viewing engine
in Autonomy (formerly Verity) KeyView, as used by IBM Lotus Notes
7.0.2 and 7.0.3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
a long pathname, as demonstrated by a long SRC attribute of an IMG
element in an HTML document.
