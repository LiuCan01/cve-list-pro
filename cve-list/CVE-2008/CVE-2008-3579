Calacode @Mail 5.41 on Linux does not require administrative
authentication for build-plesk-upgrade.php, which allows remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information by creating and downloading
a backup archive of the entire @Mail directory tree.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged for remote exploitation of CVE-2008-3395.  NOTE: the
provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained
solely from third party information.
