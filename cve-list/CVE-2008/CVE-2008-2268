Open redirect vulnerability in interface/redirect.htm.php in Mjguest
6.7 GT Rev.01 allows user-assisted remote attackers to redirect users
to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the
goto parameter in a redirect action to mjguest.php.  NOTE: this is
user-assisted because there is a delay and a notification before
redirection occurs.
