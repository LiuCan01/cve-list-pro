Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the DownloadsPlus module in
PHP-Nuke allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
uploading a file with (1) .htm, (2) .html, or (3) .txt extensions,
then accessing it via a direct request to the file.  NOTE: the
provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained
solely from third party information.  NOTE: it is unclear how allowing
the upload of .html or .txt files supports arbitrary code execution;
this might be legitimate functionality.
