The user interface event dispatcher in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.3 on
Windows XP SP2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a series of
keypress, click, onkeydown, onkeyup, onmousedown, and onmouseup
events.  NOTE: it was later reported that Firefox 3.0.2 on Mac OS X
10.5 is also affected.
