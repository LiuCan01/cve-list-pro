Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/39893

CRLF injection vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in the
Apache HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and
earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x
series allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTTP
headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks by uploading a
file with a multi-line name containing HTTP header sequences and a
file extension, which leads to injection within a (1) "406 Not
Acceptable" or (2) "300 Multiple Choices" HTTP response when the
extension is omitted in a request for the file.
