The administration panel on the Airspan WiMax ProST 4.1 antenna with
6.5.38.0 software does not verify authentication credentials, which
allows remote attackers to (1) upload malformed firmware or (2) bind
the antenna to a different WiMAX base station via unspecified requests
to forms under process_adv/.
