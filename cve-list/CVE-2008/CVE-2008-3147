WeFi 3.2.1.4.1, when diagnostic mode is enabled, stores (1) WEP, (2)
WPA, and (3) WPA2 access-point keys in (a) ClientWeFiLog.dat, (b)
ClientWeFiLog.bak, and possibly (c) a certain .inf file under
%PROGRAMFILES%WeFiUsers, and uses cleartext for the ClientWeFiLog
files, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by
reading these files.
