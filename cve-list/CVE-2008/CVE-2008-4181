Directory traversal vulnerability in includes/xml.php in the Netenberg
Fantastico De Luxe module before 2.10.4 r19 for cPanel, when cPanel
PHP Register Globals is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to
include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) or
absolute pathname in the fantasticopath parameter.  NOTE: in some
environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using
a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
