ipnat in IP Filter in Sun Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris before snv_96,
when running on a DNS server with Network Address Translation (NAT)
configured, improperly changes the source port of a packet when the
destination port is the DNS port, which allows remote attackers to
bypass an intended CVE-2008-1447 protection mechanism and spoof the
responses to DNS queries sent by named.
