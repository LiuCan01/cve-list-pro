Microsoft Word 2000 9.0.2812 and 2003 11.8106.8172 does not properly
handle unordered lists, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .doc file.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
