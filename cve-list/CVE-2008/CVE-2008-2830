Open Scripting Architecture in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.11 and 10.5.4, and
some other 10.4 and 10.5 versions, does not properly restrict the
loading of scripting addition plugins, which allows local users to
gain privileges via scripting addition commands to a privileged
application, as originally demonstrated by an osascript tell command
to ARDAgent.
