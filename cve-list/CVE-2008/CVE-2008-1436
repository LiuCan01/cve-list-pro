Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/41880

Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP2, Vista, and Server 2003 and 2008
does not properly assign activities to the (1) NetworkService and (2)
LocalService accounts, which might allow context-dependent attackers
to gain privileges by using one service process to capture a resource
from a second service process that has a LocalSystem
privilege-escalation ability, related to improper management of the
SeImpersonatePrivilege user right, as originally reported for Internet
Information Services (IIS), aka Token Kidnapping.
