Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Nokia Series 40 3rd edition
FP1, and possibly later devices, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via unknown vectors, probably related to MIDP privilege
escalation and persistent MIDlets, aka "ISSUES 11-15." NOTE: as of
20080807, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no
actionable information.  However, because it is from a company led by
a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for
tracking purposes.
