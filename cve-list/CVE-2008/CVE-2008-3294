src/configure.in in Vim 5.0 through 7.1, when used for a build with
Python support, does not ensure that the Makefile-conf temporary file
has the intended ownership and permissions, which allows local users
to execute arbitrary code by modifying this file during a time window,
or by creating it ahead of time with permissions that prevent its
modification by configure.
