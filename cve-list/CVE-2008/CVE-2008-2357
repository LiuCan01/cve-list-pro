Reference: XF:mtr-splitredraw-bo(42535)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/42535

Stack-based buffer overflow in the split_redraw function in split.c in
mtr before 0.73, when invoked with the -p (aka --split) option, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS PTR
record.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the
ns_name_ntop function in resolv/ns_name.c in glibc and the proper fix
should be in glibc; if so, then this should not be treated as a
vulnerability in mtr.
