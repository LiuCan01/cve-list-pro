The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 disables
itself upon encountering a certain X-XSS-Protection HTTP header, which
allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection mechanism and
conduct XSS attacks by injecting this header after a CRLF sequence.
NOTE: the vendor has reportedly stated that the XSS Filter
intentionally does not attempt to "address every conceivable XSS
attack scenario."
