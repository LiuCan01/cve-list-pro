The GDTdiIcpt.sys driver in G DATA AntiVirus 2008, InternetSecurity
2008, and TotalCare 2008 populates kernel registers with IOCTL
0x8317001c input values, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or gain privileges via a crafted IOCTL request,
as demonstrated by execution of the KeSetEvent function with modified
register contents.
