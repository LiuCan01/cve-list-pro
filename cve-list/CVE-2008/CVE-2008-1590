JavaScriptCore in WebKit on Apple iPhone before 2.0 and iPod touch
before 2.0 does not properly perform runtime garbage collection, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (application crash) via unspecified vectors that trigger
memory corruption, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-2317.
