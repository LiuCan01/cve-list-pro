The management interface in Akamai Client (formerly Red Swoosh) 3322
and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
HTTP request that contains (1) no Referer header, or (2) a spoofed
Referer header that matches an approved domain, which allows remote
attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and
force the client to download and execute arbitrary files.
