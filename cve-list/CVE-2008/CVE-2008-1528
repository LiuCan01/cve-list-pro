ZyXEL Prestige routers, including P-660, P-661, and P-662 models with
firmware 3.40(AGD.2) through 3.40(AHQ.3), allow remote authenticated
users to obtain authentication data by making direct HTTP requests and
then reading the HTML source, as demonstrated by a request for (1)
RemMagSNMP.html, which discloses SNMP communities; or (2) WLAN.html,
which discloses WEP keys.
