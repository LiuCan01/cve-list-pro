The DebugDiag ActiveX control in CrashHangExt.dll, possibly 1.0, in
Microsoft Debug Diagnostic Tool allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and Internet Explorer 6.0
crash) via a large negative integer argument to the
GetEntryPointForThread method.  NOTE: this issue might only be
exploitable in limited environments or non-default browser settings.
