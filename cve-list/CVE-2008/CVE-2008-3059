member/settings_account.php in Octeth Oempro 3.5.5.1, and possibly
other versions before 4, uses cleartext to transmit a password entered
in the FormValue_Password field, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network,
related to the "Settings - Account Information" tab.
