Unspecified vulnerability in Sun Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris before
snv_96 allows (1) context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (panic) via vectors involving creation of a crafted file and
use of the sendfilev system call, as demonstrated by a file served by
an Apache 2.2.x web server with EnableSendFile configured; and (2)
local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a call to the
sendfile system call, as reachable through the sendfilev library.
