Check Point VPN-1 Power/UTM, with NGX R60 through R65 and NG AI R55
software, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (site-to-site VPN tunnel outage), and possibly intercept
network traffic, by configuring the local RFC1918 IP address to be the
same as one of this tunnel's endpoint RFC1918 IP addresses, and then
using SecuRemote to connect to a network interface at the other
endpoint.
