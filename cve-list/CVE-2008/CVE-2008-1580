CFNetwork in Safari in Apple Mac OS X before 10.5.3 automatically
sends an SSL client certificate in response to a web server's
certificate request, which allows remote web sites to obtain sensitive
information (Subject data) from personally identifiable certificates,
and use arbitrary certificates to track user activities across
domains, a related issue to CVE-2007-4879.
