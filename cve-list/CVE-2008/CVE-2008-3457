Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in setup.php in phpMyAdmin
before 2.11.8 allows user-assisted remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted setup arguments.  NOTE: this
issue can only be exploited in limited scenarios in which the attacker
must be able to modify config/config.inc.php.
