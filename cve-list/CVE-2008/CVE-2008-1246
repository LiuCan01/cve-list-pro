** DISPUTED **

The Cisco PIX/ASA Finesse Operation System 7.1 and 7.2 allows local
users to gain privileges by entering characters at the enable prompt,
erasing these characters via the Backspace key, and then holding down
the Backspace key for one second after erasing the final
character. NOTE: third parties, including one who works for the
vendor, have been unable to reproduce the flaw unless the enable
password is blank.
