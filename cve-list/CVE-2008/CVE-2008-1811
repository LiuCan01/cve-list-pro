Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Application Express 3.0.1 has
unspecified impact and remote authenticated attack vectors related to
flows_030000.wwv_execute_immediate, aka APEX01.  NOTE: the previous
information was obtained from the April 2008 CPU.  Oracle has not
commented on reliable researcher claims that APEX01 is for
insufficient authorization checks for SQL commands in the run_ddl
function in flows_030000.wwv_execute_immediate, allowing privilege
escalation by certain non-DBA remote authenticated users.
