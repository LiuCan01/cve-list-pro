Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 on Windows Vista allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) via JavaScript code with
a long string value for the hash property (aka location.hash). NOTE:
it was later reported that earlier versions are also affected, and
that the impact is CPU consumption and application hang in unspecified
circumstances perhaps involving other platforms.
