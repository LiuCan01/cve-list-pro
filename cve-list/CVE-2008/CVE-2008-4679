The Web Services Security component in IBM WebSphere Application
Server (WAS) 6.0.2 before 6.0.2.31 and 6.1 before 6.1.0.19, when
Certificate Store Collections is configured to use Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRL), does not call the setRevocationEnabled method
on the PKIXBuilderParameters object, which prevents the "Java security
method" from checking the revocation status of X.509 certificates and
allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a
SOAP message with a revoked certificate.
