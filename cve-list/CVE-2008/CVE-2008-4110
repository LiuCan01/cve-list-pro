Buffer overflow in the SQLVDIRLib.SQLVDirControl ActiveX control in
ToolsBinnsqlvdir.dll in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (aka SQL Server
8.0) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long URL in the second
argument to the Connect method.  NOTE: this issue is not a
vulnerability in many environments, since the control is not marked as
safe for scripting and would not execute with default Internet
Explorer settings.
