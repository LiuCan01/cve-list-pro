The password_check function in auth/auth_phpbb3.php in WoW Raid
Manager 3.5.1 before Patch 1, when using PHPBB3 authentication, (1)
does not invoke the CheckPassword function with the required
arguments, which always triggers an authentication failure, and (2)
returns true instead of false when an authentication failure occurs,
which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain
privileges with an arbitrary password.
