The SuiteLink Service (aka slssvc.exe) in WonderWare SuiteLink before
2.0 Patch 01, as used in WonderWare InTouch 8.0, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
service shutdown) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large
length value in a Registration packet to TCP port 5413, which causes a
memory allocation failure.
