Integer overflow in multiple F-Secure anti-virus products, including
Internet Security 2006 through 2008, Anti-Virus 2006 through 2008, and
others, when configured to scan inside compressed archives, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPM
compressed archive file, which triggers a buffer overflow.
