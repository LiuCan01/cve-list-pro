Directory traversal vulnerability in the Notes (aka Flash Notes or
instant messages) feature in tb2ftp.dll in Timbuktu Pro 8.6.5 for
Windows, and possibly 8.7 for Mac OS X, allows remote attackers to
upload files to arbitrary locations via a destination filename with a
 (backslash) character followed by ../ (dot dot slash) sequences.
NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup
folder.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete
fix for CVE-2007-4220.
