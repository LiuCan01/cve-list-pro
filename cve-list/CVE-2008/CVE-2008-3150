Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in Neutrino Atomic
Edition 0.8.4 allows remote attackers to read and modify files, as
demonstrated by manipulating data/sess.php in (1) usb and (2) del_pag
actions.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by performing
an upload that bypasses the intended access restrictions that were
implemented in sess.php.
