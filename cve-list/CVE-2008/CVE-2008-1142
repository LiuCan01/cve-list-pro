rxvt 2.6.4 opens a terminal window on :0 if the DISPLAY environment
variable is not set, which might allow local users to hijack X11
connections.  NOTE: it was later reported that rxvt-unicode, mrxvt,
aterm, multi-aterm, and wterm are also affected.  NOTE: realistic
attack scenarios require that the victim enters a command on the wrong
machine.
