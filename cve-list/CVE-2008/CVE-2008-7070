Argument injection vulnerability in the URI handler in KVIrc 3.4.2
Shiny allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a "
(quote) followed by command line switches in a (1) irc:///, (2)
irc6:///, (3) ircs:///, or (4) and ircs6:/// URI.  NOTE: this might be
due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2951.
