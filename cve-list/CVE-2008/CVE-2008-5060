Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ModernBill 4.4
and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the DIR parameter to (1) export_batch.inc.php, (2)
run_auto_suspend.cron.php, and (3) send_email_cache.php in
include/scripts/; (4)
include/misc/mod_2checkout/2checkout_return.inc.php; and (5)
include/html/nettools.popup.php, different vectors than CVE-2006-4034
and CVE-2005-1054.
