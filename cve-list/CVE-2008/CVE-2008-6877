** DISPUTED **

Directory traversal vulnerability in admin/includes/initsystem.php in
Zen Cart 1.3.8 and 1.3.8a, when .htaccess is not supported, allows
remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a ..
(dot dot) in the loader_file parameter.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this
issue, stating "at worst, the use of this vulnerability will reveal
some local file paths."
