The ipsec4_get_ulp function in the kernel in NetBSD 2.0 through 3.1
and NetBSD-current before 20071028, when the fast_ipsec subsystem is
enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass the IPsec policy by sending
packets from a source machine with a different endianness than the
destination machine, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0905.
