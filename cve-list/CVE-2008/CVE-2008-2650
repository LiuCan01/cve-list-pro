Directory traversal vulnerability in cmsimple/cms.php in CMSimple 3.1,
when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include
and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the sl
parameter to index.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file
execution by including adm.php and then invoking the upload action.
NOTE: on 20080601, the vendor patched 3.1 without changing the version
number.
