Integer signedness error in the ip_set_srcfilter function in the IP
Multicast Filter in uts/common/inet/ip/ip_multi.c in the kernel in Sun
Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris before snv_92 allows local users to execute
arbitrary code in other Solaris Zones via an SIOCSIPMSFILTER IOCTL
request with a large value of the imsf->imsf_numsrc field, which
triggers an out-of-bounds write of kernel memory.  NOTE: this was
reported as an integer overflow, but the root cause involves the
bypass of a signed comparison.
