Heap-based buffer overflow in an API in GDI in Microsoft Windows 2000
SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, Vista Gold and SP1, and
Server 2008 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service or execute arbitrary code via a WMF file with a malformed
file-size parameter, which would not be properly handled by a
third-party application that uses this API for a copy operation, aka
"GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerability."
