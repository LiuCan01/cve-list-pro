DLMFENC.sys 1.0.0.28 in DESlock+ 3.2.7 allows local users to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code
via a certain DLMFENC_IOCTL request to \.DLKPFSD_Device that
overwrites a pointer, probably related to use of the ProbeForRead
function when ProbeForWrite was intended.
