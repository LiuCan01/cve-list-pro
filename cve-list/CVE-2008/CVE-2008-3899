TrueCrypt 5.0 stores pre-boot authentication passwords in the BIOS
Keyboard buffer and does not clear this buffer before and after use,
which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading
the physical memory locations associated with this buffer.  NOTE: the
researcher mentions a response from the vendor denying the
vulnerability.
