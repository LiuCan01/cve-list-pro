The "Make a backup" functionality in Content Management Made Easy
(CMME) 1.12 stores sensitive information under the web root with
insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to discover
(1) account names and (2) password hashes via a direct request for (a)
backup/cmme_data.zip or (b) backup/cmme_cmme.zip.  NOTE: it was later
reported that vector a also affects CMME 1.19.
