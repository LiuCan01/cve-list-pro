The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) implementation on IBM
zSeries servers does not validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery
messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(loss of connectivity) or read private network traffic via a spoofed
message that modifies the Forward Information Base (FIB), a related
issue to CVE-2008-2476.
