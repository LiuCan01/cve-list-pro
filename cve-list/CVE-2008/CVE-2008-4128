Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the HTTP
Administration component in Cisco IOS 12.4 on the 871 Integrated
Services Router allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
via (1) a certain "show privilege" command to the /level/15/exec/-
URI, and (2) a certain "alias exec" command to the
/level/15/exec/-/configure/http URI.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
