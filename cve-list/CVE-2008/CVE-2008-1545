The setRequestHeader method of the XMLHttpRequest object in Microsoft
Internet Explorer 7 does not restrict the dangerous Transfer-Encoding
HTTP request header, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP
request splitting and HTTP request smuggling attacks via a POST
containing a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a request body
with an incorrect chunk size.
