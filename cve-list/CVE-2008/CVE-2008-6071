Heap-based buffer overflow in the DecodeImage function in
coders/pict.c in GraphicsMagick before 1.1.14, and 1.2.x before 1.2.3,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT image.  NOTE: some
of these details are obtained from third party information.
