Use-after-free vulnerability in the
_gnutls_handshake_hash_buffers_clear function in
lib/gnutls_handshake.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS 2.3.5 through 2.4.0
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via TLS transmission of data that is
improperly used when the peer calls gnutls_handshake within a normal
session, leading to attempted access to a deallocated libgcrypt
handle.
