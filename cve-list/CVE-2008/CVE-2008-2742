Unrestricted file upload in the mcpuk file editor
(atk/attributes/fck/editor/filemanager/browser/mcpuk/connectors/php/config.php)
in Achievo 1.2.0 through 1.3.2 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by uploading a file with .php followed by a safe
extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in the
Achievo root directory.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability in
environments that support multiple extensions, such as Apache with the
mod_mime module enabled.
