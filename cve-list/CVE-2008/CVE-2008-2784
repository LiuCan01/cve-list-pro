The smtp_filter function in spamdyke before 3.1.8 does not filter RCPT
commands after encountering the first DATA command, which allows
remote attackers to use the server as an open mail relay by sending
RCPT commands with invalid recipients, followed by a DATA command,
followed by arbitrary RCPT commands and a second DATA command.
