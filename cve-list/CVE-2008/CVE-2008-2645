Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Brim (formerly
Booby) 1.0.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
a URL in the renderer parameter to template.tpl.php in (1) barrel/,
(2) barry/, (3) mylook/, (4) oerdec/, (5) penguin/, (6) sidebar/, (7)
slashdot/, and (8) text-only/ in templates/.  NOTE: this can also be
leveraged to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory
traversal sequences.
