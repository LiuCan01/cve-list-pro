The ooh323 channel driver in Asterisk Addons 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and
Asterisk-Addons 1.4.x before 1.4.7 creates a remotely accessible TCP
port that is intended solely for localhost communication, and
interprets some TCP application-data fields as addresses of memory to
free, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(daemon crash) via crafted TCP packets.
