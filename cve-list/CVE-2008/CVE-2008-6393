PSI Jabber client before 0.12.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
file transfer request with a negative value in a SOCKS5 option, which
bypasses a signed integer check and triggers an integer overflow and a
heap-based buffer overflow.
