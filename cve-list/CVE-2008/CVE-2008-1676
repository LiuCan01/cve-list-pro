Red Hat PKI Common Framework (rhpki-common) in Red Hat Certificate
System (aka Certificate Server or RHCS) 7.1 through 7.3, and Netscape
Certificate Management System 6.x, does not recognize Certificate
Authority profile constraints on Extensions, which might allow remote
attackers to bypass intended restrictions and conduct
man-in-the-middle attacks by submitting a certificate signing request
(CSR) and using the resulting certificate.
