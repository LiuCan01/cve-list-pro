Mail in Apple Mac OS X before 10.5, when an IPv6 SMTP server is used,
does not properly initialize memory, which might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(application crash), or obtain sensitive information (memory contents)
in opportunistic circumstances, by sending an e-mail message.
