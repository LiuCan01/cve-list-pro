Timbuktu Pro 8.6.5 for Windows, and possibly 8.7 for Mac OS X, does
not perform input validation before logging information fields taken
from packets from a remote peer, which allows remote attackers to
generate crafted log entries, and possibly avoid detection of attacks,
via modified (1) computer name, (2) user name, and (3) IP address
fields.
