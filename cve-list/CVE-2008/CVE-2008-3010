Microsoft Windows Media Player 6.4, Windows Media Format Runtime 7.1
through 11, and Windows Media Services 4.1 and 9 incorrectly associate
ISATAP addresses with the Local Intranet zone, which allows remote
servers to capture NTLM credentials, and execute arbitrary code
through credential-reflection attacks, by sending an authentication
request, aka "ISATAP Vulnerability."
