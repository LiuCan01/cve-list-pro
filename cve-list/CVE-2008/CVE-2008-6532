Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the
update feature in Drupal 5.x before 5.13 and 6.x before 6.7 allow
remote attackers to perform unauthorized actions as the superuser via
unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by causing the superuser to
"execute old updates" that modify the database.
