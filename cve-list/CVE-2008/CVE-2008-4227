Apple iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.1 and iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1
through 2.1 changes the encryption level of PPTP VPN connections to a
lower level than was previously used, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain sensitive information or hijack a connection by
decrypting network traffic.
