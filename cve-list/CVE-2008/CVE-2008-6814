Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in image_upload.php in the
SimpleBoard (com_simpleboard) component 1.0.1 and earlier for Mambo
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file
with an executable extension and an image/jpeg content type, then
accessing this file via a direct request to the file in
components/com_simpleboard/, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2006-3528.
