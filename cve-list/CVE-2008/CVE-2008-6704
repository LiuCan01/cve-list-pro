Integer overflow in the NET_Compressor::Decompress function in
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl 1.0006 and earlier allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a crafted
packet with a 0xc1 value that contains no compressed data, which
triggers a copy of a large amount of memory.
