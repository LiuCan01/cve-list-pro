Stack-based buffer overflow in the ctags parsing code in Programmer's
Notepad before 2.0.8.718 allows user-assisted remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary
code via a crafted .c file, when the victim selects the Jump To
dialog.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
