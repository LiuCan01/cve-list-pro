Microsoft Office Word 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, 2003 SP3, and 2007 Gold and

Converter for Mac allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
crafted control words related to multiple Drawing Object tags in (1)
an RTF file or (2) a rich text e-mail message, which triggers
incorrect memory allocation and a heap-based buffer overflow, aka
"Word RTF Object Parsing Vulnerability," a different vulnerability
