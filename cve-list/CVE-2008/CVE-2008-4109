A certain Debian patch for OpenSSH before 4.3p2-9etch3 on etch; before
4.6p1-1 on sid and lenny; and on other distributions such as SUSE uses
functions that are not async-signal-safe in the signal handler for
login timeouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (connection slot exhaustion) via multiple login attempts.
NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2006-5051.
