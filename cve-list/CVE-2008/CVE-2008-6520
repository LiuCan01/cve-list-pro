Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the SSI filter in Xitami Web
Server 2.5c2, and possibly other versions, allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a URI that ends in (1)
.ssi, (2) .shtm, or (3) .shtml, which triggers incorrect logging code
involving the sendfmt function in the SMT kernel.
