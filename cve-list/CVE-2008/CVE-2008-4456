Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45590

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the command-line client in
MySQL 5.0.26 through 5.0.45, and other versions including versions
later than 5.0.45, when the --html option is enabled, allows attackers
to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by placing it in a database
cell, which might be accessed by this client when composing an HTML
document.  NOTE: as of 20081031, the issue has not been fixed in MySQL
5.0.67.
