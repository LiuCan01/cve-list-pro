The disconnection feature in Citrix Web Interface 5.0 and 5.0.1 for
Java Application Servers does not properly terminate a user's web
interface session, which allows attackers with access to the same
browser instance to gain access to the user's Web Interface session.
NOTE: the attacker must also have valid credentials to the Web
Interface.
