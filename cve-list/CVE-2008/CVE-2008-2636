The HTTP service on the Cisco Linksys WRH54G with firmware 1.01.03
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (management
interface outage) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a URI that
begins with a "/./" sequence, contains many instances of a
"front_page" sequence, and ends with a ".asp" sequence.
