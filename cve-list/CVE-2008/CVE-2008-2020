The CAPTCHA implementation as used in (1) Francisco Burzi PHP-Nuke 7.0
and 8.1, (2) my123tkShop e-Commerce-Suite (aka 123tkShop) 0.9.1, (3)
phpMyBitTorrent 1.2.2, (4) TorrentFlux 2.3, (5) e107 0.7.11, (6) WebZE
0.5.9, (7) Open Media Collectors Database (aka OpenDb) 1.5.0b4, and
(8) Labgab 1.1 uses a code_bg.jpg background image and the PHP
ImageString function in a way that produces an insufficient number of
different images, which allows remote attackers to pass the CAPTCHA
test via an automated attack using a table of all possible image
checksums and their corresponding digit strings.
