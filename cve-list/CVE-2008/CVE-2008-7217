Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, when running on Macintosh systems that
restrict Office access to administrators, does not enforce this
restriction for user ID 502, which allows local users with that ID to
bypass intended security policy and access Office programs, related to
permissions and ownership for certain directories.
