The pnVarPrepForStore function in PostNuke 0.764 and earlier skips
input sanitization when magic_quotes_runtime is enabled, which allows
remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks and execute
arbitrary SQL commands via input associated with server variables, as
demonstrated by the CLIENT_IP HTTP header (HTTP_CLIENT_IP variable).
