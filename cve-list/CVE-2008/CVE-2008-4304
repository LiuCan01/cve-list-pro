general/login.php in phpCollab 2.5 rc3 and earlier allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in
unspecified input related to the SSL_CLIENT_CERT environment variable.
NOTE: in some environments, SSL_CLIENT_CERT always has a
base64-encoded string value, which may impose constraints on injection
for typical shells.
