Stack-based buffer overflow in Trend Micro OfficeScan Corporate
Edition 8.0 Patch 2 build 1189 and earlier, and 7.3 Patch 3 build 1314
and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
cause a denial of service (crash) via a long encrypted password, which
triggers the overflow in (1) cgiChkMasterPwd.exe, (2) policyserver.exe
as reachable through cgiABLogon.exe, and other vectors.
