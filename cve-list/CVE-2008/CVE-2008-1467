** DISPUTED **

CenterIM 4.22.3 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URI, related
to "received URLs in the message window."  NOTE: this issue has been
disputed due to the user-assisted nature, since the URL must be
selected and launched by the victim.
