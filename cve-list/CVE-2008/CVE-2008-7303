The nonet and nointernet sandbox profiles in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.x do
not propagate restrictions to all created processes, which allows
remote attackers to access network resources via a crafted
application, as demonstrated by use of launchctl to trigger the
launchd daemon's execution of a script file, a related issue to
CVE-2011-1516.
