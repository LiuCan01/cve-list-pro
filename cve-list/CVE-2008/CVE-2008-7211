CreativeLabs es1371mp.sys 5.1.3612.0 WDM audio driver, as used in
Ensoniq PCI 1371 sound cards and when running on Windows Vista, does
not create a Functional Device Object (FDO) to prevent user-moade
access to the Physical Device Object (PDO), which allows local users
to gain SYSTEM privileges via a crafted IRP request that dereferences
a NULL FsContext pointer.
