Multiple integer underflows in the Real demuxer (demux_real.c) in
MPlayer 1.0_rc2 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (process termination) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a crafted video file that causes the stream_read function to read
or write arbitrary memory.
