Heap-based buffer overflow in the open_man_file function in
callbacks.c in gmanedit 0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a crafted man page, which is not properly handled
during utf8 conversion.  NOTE: another overflow was reported using a
configuration file, but that vector does not have a scenario that
crosses privilege boundaries.
