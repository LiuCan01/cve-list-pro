The FlexGrid ActiveX control in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, Visual
FoxPro 8.0 SP1 and 9.0 SP1 and SP2, Office FrontPage 2002 SP3, and
Office Project 2003 SP3 does not properly handle errors during access
to incorrectly initialized objects, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document, related to
corruption of the "system state," aka "FlexGrid Control Memory
Corruption Vulnerability."
