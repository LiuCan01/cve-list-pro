Directory traversal vulnerability in the get_lang function in
global.php in Quicksilver Forums 1.4.2 and earlier, as used in QSF
Portal before 1.4.5, when running on Windows, allows remote attackers
to include and execute arbitrary local files via a "" (backslash) in
the lang parameter to index.php, which bypasses a protection mechanism
that only checks for "/" (forward slash), as demonstrated by uploading
and including PHP code in an avatar file.
