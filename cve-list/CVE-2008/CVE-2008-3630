mDNSResponder in Apple Bonjour for Windows before 1.0.5, when an
application uses the Bonjour API for unicast DNS, does not choose
random values for transaction IDs or source ports in DNS requests,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1447.
