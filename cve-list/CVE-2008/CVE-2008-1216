IBM Lotus Quickr 8.0 server, and possibly QuickPlace 7.x, does not
properly identify URIs containing cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
strings, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via a Calendar OpenDocument action to main.nsf with a Count
parameter containing a JavaScript event in a malformed element, as
demonstrated by an onload event in an IFRAME element.
