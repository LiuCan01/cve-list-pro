Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in AIST NetCat 3.12 and earlier
allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and
conduct phishing attacks via (1) the redirect parameter in a logoff
action to modules/auth/index.php or (2) the url parameter to
modules/linkmanager/redirect.php.  NOTE: this was reported within an
"HTTP Response Splitting" section in the original disclosure.
