Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component in Oracle
Database 9.2.0.8, 9.2.0.8DV, 10.1.0.5, and 10.2.0.2 allows remote
attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown vectors.
NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the Oracle October
2008 CPU. Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that
this issue involves an authentication bypass by establishing a TNS
connection and impersonating a user session via a crafted
authentication message during proxy authentication mode.
