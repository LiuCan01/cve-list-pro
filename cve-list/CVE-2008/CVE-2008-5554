The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 does not
properly handle some HTTP headers that appear after a CRLF sequence in
a URI, which allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection
mechanism and conduct XSS or redirection attacks, as demonstrated by
the (1) Location and (2) Set-Cookie HTTP headers.  NOTE: the vendor has
reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt
to "address every conceivable XSS attack scenario."
