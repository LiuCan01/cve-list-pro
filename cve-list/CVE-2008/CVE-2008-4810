The _expand_quoted_text function in libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php in
Smarty 2.6.20 before r2797 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via vectors related to templates and (1) a
dollar-sign character, aka "php executed in templates;" and (2) a
double quoted literal string, aka a "function injection security
hole." NOTE: each vector affects slightly different SVN revisions.
