SQL injection vulnerability in submit.php in PHP-Fusion 6.01.14 and
6.00.307, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled and the database table
prefix is known, allows remote authenticated users to execute
arbitrary SQL commands via the submit_info[] parameter in a link
submission action.  NOTE: it was later reported that 7.00.2 is also
affected.
