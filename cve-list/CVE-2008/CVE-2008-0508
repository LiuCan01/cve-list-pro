Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
deans_permalinks_migration.php in the Dean's Permalinks Migration 1.0
plugin for WordPress allows remote attackers to modify the
oldstructure (aka dean_pm_config[oldstructure]) configuration setting
as administrators via the old_struct parameter in a
deans_permalinks_migration.php action to wp-admin/options-general.php,
as demonstrated by placing an XSS sequence in this setting.
