Buffer overflow in the web interface in BitTorrent 6.0.1 (build 7859)
and earlier, and uTorrent 1.7.6 (build 7859) and earlier, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and
crash) via a crafted Range header.  NOTE: this is probably a different
vulnerability than CVE-2008-0071 and CVE-2008-0364.
