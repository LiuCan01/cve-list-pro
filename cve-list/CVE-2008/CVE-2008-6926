Directory traversal vulnerability in
autoinstall4imagesgalleryupgrade.php in the Fantastico De Luxe Module
for cPanel allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
local files via directory traversal sequences in the scriptpath_show
parameter in a GoAhead action.  NOTE: this issue only crosses
privilege boundaries when security settings such as disable_functions
and safe_mode are active, since exploitation requires uploading of
executable code to a home directory.
