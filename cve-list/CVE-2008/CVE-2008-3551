Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Sun Java Platform Micro
Edition (aka Java ME, J2ME, or mobile Java), as distributed in Sun
Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via unknown vectors.  NOTE: as of 20080807, the only disclosure is
a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, because
it is from a company led by a well-known researcher, it is being
assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
