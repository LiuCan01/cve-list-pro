The Perforce service (p4s.exe) in Perforce Server 2007.3/143793 and
earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) via a missing parameter to the (1) dm-FaultFile, (2)
dm-LazyCheck, (3) dm-ResolvedFile, (4) dm-OpenFile, (5) crypto, and
possibly unspecified other commands, which triggers a NULL pointer
dereference.
