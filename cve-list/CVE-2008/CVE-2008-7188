ClipShare 2.6 does not properly restrict access to certain
functionality, which allows remote attackers to change the profile of
arbitrary users via a modified uid variable to siteadmin/useredit.php.
NOTE: this can be used to recover the password of the user by using
the modified e-mail address in the email parameter to recoverpass.php.
