Nortel Networks UNIStim IP Phone 0604DAS allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a long ping packet ("ping of
death").  NOTE: this issue could not be reproduced by a third party,
who tested it on 0604DAD. In addition, the original researcher was not
able to reliably reproduce the issue.
