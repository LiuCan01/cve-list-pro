Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in Tuned
Studios (1) Subwoofer, (2) Freeze Theme, (3) Orange Cutout, (4) Lonely
Maple, (5) Endless, (6) Classic Theme, and (7) Music Theme webpage
templates allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
files via ".." sequences in the page parameter.  NOTE: this can be
leveraged for remote file inclusion when running in some PHP 5
environments.
