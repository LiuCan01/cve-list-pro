Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in NetApp Data ONTAP, as used on
NetApp and IBM eServer platforms, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands, cause a denial of service (system crash), or
obtain sensitive information, probably related to insufficient access
control for HTTP requests.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2008-3160.
