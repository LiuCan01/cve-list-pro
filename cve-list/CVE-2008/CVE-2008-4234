Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the Quarantine feature in
CoreTypes in Apple Mac OS X 10.5 before 10.5.6 allows user-assisted
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an executable file with
the content type indicating no application association for the file,
which does not trigger a "potentially unsafe" warning message.
