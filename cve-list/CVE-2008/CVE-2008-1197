The Marvell driver for the Netgear WN802T Wi-Fi access point with
firmware 1.3.16 on the Marvell 88W8361P-BEM1 chipset does not properly
parse the SSID information element in an association request, which
allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (device
reboot or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a "Null SSID."
