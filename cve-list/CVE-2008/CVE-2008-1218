Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and
1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote
attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB
characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the
skip_password_check field to be specified.
