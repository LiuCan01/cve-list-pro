Apple iTunes before 8.0 on Mac OS X 10.4.11, when iTunes Music Sharing
is enabled but blocked by the host-based firewall, presents misleading
information about firewall security, which might allow remote
attackers to leverage an exposure that would be absent if the
administrator were given better information.
