includes/library.php in netOffice Dwins 1.3 p2 compares the
demoSession variable to the 'true' string literal instead of the true
boolean literal, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication and execute arbitrary code by setting this variable to
1, as demonstrated by uploading a PHP script via an add action to
projects_site/uploadfile.php.
