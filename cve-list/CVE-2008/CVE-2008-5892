Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ClickAndEmail allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the ID parameter
to admin_dblayers.asp in an update action, (2) the adminid parameter
to admin_loginCheck.asp (aka the USERNAME field in admin_main.asp),
and (3) the PassWord parameter to admin_loginCheck.asp (aka the
PASSWORD field in admin_main.asp).  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
