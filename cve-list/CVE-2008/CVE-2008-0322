The I2O Utility Filter driver (i2omgmt.sys) 5.1.2600.2180 for
Microsoft Windows XP sets Everyone/Write permissions for the
"\.I2OExc" device interface, which allows local users to gain
privileges.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to overwrite arbitrary
memory and execute code via an IOCTL call with a crafted DeviceObject
pointer.
