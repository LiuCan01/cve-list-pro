The Simple Access module for Drupal 5.x through 5.x-1.2-2 does not
properly handle the privacy information for nodes, which might allow
remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, and read or
modify nodes, in opportunistic circumstances related to interaction
between Simple Access and (1) Node clone or (2) Project issue
tracking.
