Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in SetCMS 3.6.5 allows
remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a ..
(dot dot) in the set parameter, as demonstrated by sending a certain
CLIENT_IP HTTP header in an enter action to index.php, and injecting
PHP sequences into files/enter.set, which is then included by
index.php.
