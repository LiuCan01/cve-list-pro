gdiplus.dll in GDI+ in Microsoft Windows XP SP3 does not properly
handle crafted .ico files, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a
certain crash.ico file on a web site, and allows user-assisted
attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and
persistent application crash) via this crash.ico file on the desktop,
a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-2237.
