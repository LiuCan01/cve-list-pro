Buffer overflow in Adobe Photoshop Album Starter Edition 3.2, and
possibly After Effects CS3, allows user-assisted remote attackers and
physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code via a BMP
file with an invalid image header.  NOTE: the related issue in
Photoshop CS3 is already covered by CVE-2007-2244.
