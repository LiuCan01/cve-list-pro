pam_sm_authenticate in pam_pgsql.c in libpam-pgsql 0.6.3 does not
properly consider operator precedence when evaluating the success of a
pam_get_pass function call, which allows local users to gain
privileges via a SIGINT signal when this function is executing, as
demonstrated by a CTRL-C sequence at a sudo password prompt in an
"auth sufficient pam_pgsql.so" configuration.
