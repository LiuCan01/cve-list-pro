Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
Collabtive 0.4.8 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication
of administrators for requests that (1) submit or edit a new project,
or (2) upload files to a project, or (3) attach files to messages via
unknown vectors.  NOTE: these issues can be leveraged with other
vulnerabilities to create remote attack vectors that do not require
authentication.
