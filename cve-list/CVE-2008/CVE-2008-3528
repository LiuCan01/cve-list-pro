Reference: XF:kernel-errorreporting-dos(45720)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45720

The error-reporting functionality in (1) fs/ext2/dir.c, (2)
fs/ext3/dir.c, and possibly (3) fs/ext4/dir.c in the Linux kernel
2.6.26.5 does not limit the number of printk console messages that
report directory corruption, which allows physically proximate
attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary system hang) by
mounting a filesystem that has corrupted dir->i_size and dir->i_blocks
values and performing (a) read or (b) write operations.  NOTE: there
are limited scenarios in which this crosses privilege boundaries.
