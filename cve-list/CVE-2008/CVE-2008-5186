** DISPUTED **

The set_language_path function in geshi.php in Generic Syntax
Highlighter (GeSHi) before 1.0.8.1 might allow remote attackers to
conduct file inclusion attacks via crafted inputs that influence the
default language path ($path variable).  NOTE: this issue has been
disputed by a vendor, stating that only a static value is used, so
this is not a vulnerability in GeSHi. Separate CVE identifiers would
be created for web applications that integrate GeSHi in a way that
allows control of the default language path.
