The regular expression engine (regex.c) in Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier,
1.8.6 through 1.8.6-p286, 1.8.7 through 1.8.7-p71, and 1.9 through
r18423 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite
loop and crash) via multiple long requests to a Ruby socket, related
to memory allocation failure, and as demonstrated against Webrick.
