directory.php in AJchat 0.10 allows remote attackers to bypass input
validation and conduct SQL injection attacks via a numeric parameter
with a value matching the s parameter's hash value, which prevents the
associated $_GET["s"] variable from being unset.  NOTE: it could be
argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP
command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so,
then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in AJChat.
