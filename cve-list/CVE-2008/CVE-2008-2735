The HTTP server in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500
devices 8.0 before 8.0(3)15 and 8.1 before 8.1(1)5, when configured as
a clientless SSL VPN endpoint, does not properly process URIs, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload)
via a URI in a crafted SSL or HTTP packet, aka Bug ID CSCsq19369.
