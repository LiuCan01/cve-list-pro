Certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5 packages for OpenSSH,
as signed in August 2008 using a legitimate Red Hat GPG key, contain
an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) that allows the
package authors to have an unknown impact.  NOTE: since the malicious
packages were not distributed from any official Red Hat sources, the
scope of this issue is restricted to users who may have obtained these
packages through unofficial distribution points.  As of 20080827, no
unofficial distributions of this software are known.
