WordPress before 2.6.2 does not properly handle MySQL warnings about
insertion of username strings that exceed the maximum column width of
the user_login column, and does not properly handle space characters
when comparing usernames, which allows remote attackers to change an
arbitrary user's password to a random value by registering a similar
username and then requesting a password reset, related to a "SQL
column truncation vulnerability." NOTE: the attacker can discover the
random password by also exploiting CVE-2008-4107.
