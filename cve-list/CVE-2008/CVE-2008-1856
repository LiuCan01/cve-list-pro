plugins/maps/db_handler.php in LinPHA 1.3.3 and earlier does not
require authentication for a settings action that modifies the
configuration file, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory
traversal attacks and execute arbitrary local files by placing
directory traversal sequences into the maps_type configuration
setting, and then sending a request to maps_view.php, which causes
plugins/maps/map.main.class.php to use the modified configuration.
