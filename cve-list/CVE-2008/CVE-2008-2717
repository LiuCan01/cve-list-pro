TYPO3 4.0.x before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1,
uses an insufficiently restrictive default fileDenyPattern for Apache,
which allows remote attackers to bypass security restrictions and
upload configuration files such as .htaccess, or conduct file upload
attacks using multiple extensions.
