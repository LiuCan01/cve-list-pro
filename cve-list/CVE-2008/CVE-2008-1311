The TFTP server in PacketTrap pt360 Tool Suite PRO 2.0.3901.0 and
earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
hang) by uploading a file named (1) '|' (pipe), (2) '"' (quotation
mark), or (3) "<>" (less than, greater than); or (4) a file with a
long name.  NOTE: the issue for vector 4 might exist because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2008-1312.
