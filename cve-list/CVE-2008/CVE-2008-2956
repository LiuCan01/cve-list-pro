** DISPUTED **

Memory leak in Pidgin 2.0.0, and possibly other versions, allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via
malformed XML documents.   NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the
upstream vendor, who states: "I was never able to identify a scenario
under which a problem occurred and the original reporter wasn't able
to supply any sort of reproduction details."
