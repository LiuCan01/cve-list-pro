Microsoft PicturePusher ActiveX control (PipPPush.DLL 7.00.0709), as
used in Microsoft Digital Image 2006 Starter Edition, allows remote
attackers to force the upload of arbitrary files by using the
AddString and Post methods and a modified PostURL to construct an HTTP
POST request.  NOTE: this issue might only be exploitable in limited
environments or non-default browser settings.
