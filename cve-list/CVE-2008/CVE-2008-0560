** DISPUTED **

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in cforms-css.php in Oliver
Seidel cforms (contactforms), a Wordpress plugin, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the tm parameter.
NOTE: CVE disputes this issue for 7.3, since there is no tm parameter,
and the code exits with a fatal error due to a call to an undefined
function.
