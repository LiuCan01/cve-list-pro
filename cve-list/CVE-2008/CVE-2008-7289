IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 5.2 before 5.2.0.5-TIV-ITDS-LA0007
does not properly handle the simultaneous changing of multiple
passwords, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to
cause a denial of service (DB2 daemon deadlock) by making password
changes that trigger updates to a DB2 password-history table.
