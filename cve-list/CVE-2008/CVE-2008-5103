The (1) python-vm-builder and (2) ubuntu-vm-builder implementations in
VMBuilder 0.9 in Ubuntu 8.10 omit the -e option when invoking chpasswd
with a root:! argument, which configures the root account with a
cleartext password of ! (exclamation point) and allows attackers to
bypass intended login restrictions.
