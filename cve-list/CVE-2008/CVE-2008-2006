Apple iCal 3.0.1 on Mac OS X allows remote CalDAV servers, and
user-assisted remote attackers, to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a .ics file containing (1) a large 16-bit integer
on a TRIGGER line, or (2) a large integer in a COUNT field on an RRULE
line.
