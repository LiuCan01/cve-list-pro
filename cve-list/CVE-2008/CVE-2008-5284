The web server in IEA Software RadiusNT and RadiusX 5.1.38 and other
versions before 5.1.44, Emerald 5.0.49 and other versions before
5.0.52, Air Marshal 2.0.4 and other versions before 2.0.8, and Radius
test client (aka Radlogin) 4.0.20 and earlier, allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) via an HTTP Content-Length header
with a negative value, which triggers a single byte overwrite of
memory using a NULL terminator.  NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
