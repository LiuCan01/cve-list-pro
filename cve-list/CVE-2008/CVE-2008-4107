Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45956

The (1) rand and (2) mt_rand functions in PHP 5.2.6 do not produce
cryptographically strong random numbers, which allows attackers to
leverage exposures in products that rely on these functions for
security-relevant functionality, as demonstrated by the password-reset
functionality in Joomla! 1.5.x and WordPress before 2.6.2, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108, and CVE-2008-4102.
