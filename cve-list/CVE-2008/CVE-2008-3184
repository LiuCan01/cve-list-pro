Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in vBulletin
3.6.10 PL2 and earlier, and 3.7.2 and earlier 3.7.x versions, allow
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the
PATH_INFO (PHP_SELF) or (2) the do parameter, as demonstrated by
requests to upload/admincp/faq.php.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged
to execute arbitrary PHP code.
