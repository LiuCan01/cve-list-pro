Flat Calendar 1.1 does not properly restrict access to administrative
functions, which allows remote attackers to (1) add new events via
calAdd.php, as reachable from admin/add.php, or (2) delete events via
admin/deleteEvent.php.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the
administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's
security documentation.
