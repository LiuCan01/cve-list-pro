** DISPUTED **

os-prober in os-prober 1.17 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary
files via a symlink attack on the (1) /tmp/mounted-map or (2)
/tmp/raided-map temporary file.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue,
stating "the insecure code path should only ever run inside a d-i
environment, which has no non-root users."
