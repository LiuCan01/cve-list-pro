Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Framework
component in Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10 CU2 and 12.0.6 allows
remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality via unknown
vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January
2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that
this issue is related to unrestricted guest access to the "About Us
Page" in the Oracle Applications Framework (OAF), which allows
attackers to obtain sensitive system and application environment
information.
