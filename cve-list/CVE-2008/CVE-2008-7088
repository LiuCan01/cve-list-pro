Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in upload.php in PhotoPost
vBGallery 2.4.2 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary
code by uploading a file with an executable extension followed by a
safe extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in
a certain path.  NOTE: this may be the same vulnerability as
CVE-2008-0251, but this is not clear due to lack of details from the
vendor.
