IBM DB2 UDB 8 before Fixpak 17 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (instance crash) via a crafted CONNECT/ATTACH data
stream that simulates a V7 client connect/attach request.  NOTE: this
may overlap CVE-2008-3858.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2008-3959.
