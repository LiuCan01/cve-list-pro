Aruba Mobility Controller running ArubaOS 3.3.1.16, and possibly other
versions, installs the same default X.509 certificate for all
installations, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication.
NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not
follow recommendations in the product's security documentation.
