Multiple buffer overflows in Princeton WordNet (wn) 3.0 allow
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long
argument on the command line; a long (2) WNSEARCHDIR, (3) WNHOME, or
(4) WNDBVERSION environment variable; or (5) a user-supplied
dictionary (aka data file).  NOTE: since WordNet itself does not run
with special privileges, this issue only crosses privilege boundaries
when WordNet is invoked as a third party component.
