The ActionScript 2 virtual machine in Adobe Flash Player 10.x before
10.0.12.36 and 9.x before 9.0.151.0, and Adobe AIR before 1.5, does
not verify a member element's size when performing (1)
DefineConstantPool, (2) ActionJump, (3) ActionPush, (4) ActionTry, and
unspecified other actions, which allows remote attackers to read
sensitive data from process memory via a crafted PDF file.
