** DISPUTED **

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in Etomite
0.6.1.4 Final allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via $_SERVER['PHP_INFO'].  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue
in a followup, stating that the affected variable is
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], and "This is not an Etomite specific exploit and
I would like the report rescinded."
