Microsoft Windows 2000 Gold through SP4, XP Gold through SP3, Server
2003 SP1 and SP2, Vista Gold and SP1, and Server 2008 allows remote
SMB servers to execute arbitrary code on a client machine by replaying
the NTLM credentials of a client user, as demonstrated by backrush,
aka "SMB Credential Reflection Vulnerability."  NOTE: some reliable
sources report that this vulnerability exists because of an
insufficient fix for CVE-2000-0834.
