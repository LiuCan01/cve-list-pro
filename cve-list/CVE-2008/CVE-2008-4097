Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45648

MySQL 5.0.51a allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by
calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA
DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are associated with
symlinks within pathnames for subdirectories of the MySQL home data
directory, which are followed when tables are created in the future.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2008-2079.
