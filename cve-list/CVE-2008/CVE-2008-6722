Novell Access Manager 3 SP4 does not properly expire X.509 certificate
sessions, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain a
logged-in session by using a victim's web-browser process that
continues to send the original and valid SSL sessionID, related to
inability of Apache Tomcat to clear entries from its SSL cache.
