Google Chrome BETA (0.2.149.27) does not prompt the user before saving
an executable file, which makes it easier for remote attackers or
malware to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) or exploit
other vulnerabilities via a URL that references an executable file,
possibly related to the "ask where to save each file before
downloading" setting.
