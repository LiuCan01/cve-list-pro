xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, does not
properly handle (a) negative and (b) zero values during unspecified
read function calls in input_file.c, input_net.c, input_smb.c, and
input_http.c, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors such as
(1) a file or (2) an HTTP response, which triggers consequences such
as out-of-bounds reads and heap-based buffer overflows.
