Untrusted search path vulnerability in valgrind before 3.4.0 allows
local users to execute arbitrary programs via a Trojan horse
.valgrindrc file in the current working directory, as demonstrated
using a malicious --db-command options.  NOTE: the severity of this
issue has been disputed, but CVE is including this issue because
execution of a program from an untrusted directory is a common
scenario.
