Skype 3.6.0.248, and other versions before 3.8.0.139, uses a
case-sensitive comparison when checking for dangerous extensions,
which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass warning dialogs
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file: URI with a dangerous
extension that uses a different case.
