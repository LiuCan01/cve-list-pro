A certain ActiveX control in WkImgSrv.dll 7.03.0616.0, as distributed
in Microsoft Works 7 and Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(browser crash) via an invalid WksPictureInterface property value,
which triggers an improper function call.
