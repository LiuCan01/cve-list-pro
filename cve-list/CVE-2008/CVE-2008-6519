Format string vulnerability in Xitami Web Server 2.2a through 2.5c2,
and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
format string specifiers in a Long Running Web Process (LRWP) request,
which triggers incorrect logging code involving the sendfmt function
in the SMT kernel.
