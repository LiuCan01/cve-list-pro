Directory traversal vulnerability in includes/header.php in
Hedgehog-CMS 1.21 allows remote attackers to include and execute
arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the c_temp_path parameter.
NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file
inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp
URL.
