Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Gold and SP1 and Microsoft
Search Server 2008 do not properly perform authentication and
authorization for administrative functions, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (server load), obtain sensitive
information, and "create scripts that would run in the context of the
site" via requests to administrative URIs, aka "Access Control
Vulnerability."
