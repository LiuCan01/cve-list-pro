Reference: CONFIRM:http://support.spreehq.org/issues/show/63

The session cookie store implementation in Spree 0.2.0 uses a
hardcoded config.action_controller_session hash value (aka secret
key), which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging an application that
contains this value within the config/environment.rb file.
