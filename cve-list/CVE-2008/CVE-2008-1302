The Perforce service (p4s.exe) in Perforce Server 2007.3/143793 and
earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) via a (1) server-DiffFile or (2) server-ReleaseFile command
with a large integer value, which is used in an array initialization
calculation, and leads to invalid memory access.
