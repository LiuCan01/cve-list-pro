** DISPUTED **

A certain ActiveX control in iisext.dll in Microsoft Internet
Information Services (IIS) allows remote attackers to set a password
via a string argument to the SetPassword method.  NOTE: this issue
could not be reproduced by a reliable third party.  In addition, the
original researcher is unreliable.  Therefore the original disclosure
is probably erroneous.
