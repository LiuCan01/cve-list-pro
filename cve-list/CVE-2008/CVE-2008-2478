** DISPUTED **

scripts/wwwacct in cPanel 11.18.6 STABLE and earlier and 11.23.1
CURRENT and earlier allows remote authenticated users with reseller
privileges to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in the
Email address field (aka Email text box).  NOTE: the vendor disputes
this, stating "I'm unable to reproduce such an issue on multiple
servers running different versions of cPanel."
