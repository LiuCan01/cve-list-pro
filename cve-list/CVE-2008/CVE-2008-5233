xine-lib 1.1.12, and other versions before 1.1.15, does not check for
failure of malloc in circumstances including (1) the
mymng_process_header function in demux_mng.c, (2) the open_mod_file
function in demux_mod.c, and (3) frame_buffer allocation in the
real_parse_audio_specific_data function in demux_real.c, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted media file.
