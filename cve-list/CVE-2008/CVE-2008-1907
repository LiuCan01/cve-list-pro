Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in
functions/display_page.func.php in cpCommerce 1.1.0 allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) id_product,
(2) id_manufacturer, and (3) id_category parameters to unspecified
components.  NOTE: this probably overlaps CVE-2007-2959 and
CVE-2007-2890.
