The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) implementation in
unspecified Cisco products and other vendors' products, as used in WPA
and WPA2 on Wi-Fi networks, has insufficient countermeasures against
certain crafted and replayed packets, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to decrypt packets from an access point (AP) to a client and
spoof packets from an AP to a client, and conduct ARP poisoning
attacks or other attacks, as demonstrated by tkiptun-ng.
