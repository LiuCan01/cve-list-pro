IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager (TPM) before 5.1.1.1 IF0006, when its
LDAP service is shared with other applications, does not require that
an LDAP user be listed in the TPM user records, which allows remote
authenticated users to execute SOAP commands that access arbitrary TPM
functionality, as demonstrated by running provisioning workflows.
