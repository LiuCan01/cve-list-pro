The Jura Internet Connection Kit for the Jura Impressa F90 coffee
maker does not properly restrict access to privileged functions, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (physical
damage), modify coffee settings, and possibly execute code via a
crafted request.  NOTE: this issue is being included in CVE because the
denial of service may include financial loss or water damage.
