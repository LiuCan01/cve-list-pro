Directory traversal vulnerability in caloggerd in CA BrightStor
ARCServe Backup 11.0, 11.1, and 11.5 allows remote attackers to append
arbitrary data to arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in
unspecified input fields, which are used in log messages.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged for code execution in many installation environments
by writing to a startup file or configuration file.
