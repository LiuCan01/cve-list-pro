Microsoft Windows Vista does not properly enforce the
NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value, which allows user-assisted remote
attackers, and possibly physically proximate attackers, to execute
arbitrary code by inserting a (1) CD-ROM device or (2) U3-enabled USB
device containing a filesystem with an Autorun.inf file, and possibly
other vectors related to (a) AutoRun and (b) AutoPlay actions.
