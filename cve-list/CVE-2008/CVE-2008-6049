** REJECT **

SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in TinyMCE 2.0.1 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the menuID
parameter.  NOTE: CVE and multiple reliable third parties dispute this
issue, since TinyMCE does not contain index.php or any PHP code.  This
may be an issue in a product that has integrated TinyMCE.
