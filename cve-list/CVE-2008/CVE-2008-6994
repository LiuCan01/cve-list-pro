Stack-based buffer overflow in the SaveAs feature
(SaveFileAsWithFilter function) in win_util.cc in Google Chrome
0.2.149.27 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a web page with a long TITLE element, which triggers the
overflow when the user saves the page and a long filename is
generated.  NOTE: it might be possible to exploit this issue via an
HTTP response that includes a long filename in a Content-Disposition
header.
