RSS-aggregator 1.0 does not require administrative authentication for
the admin/fonctions/ directory, which allows remote attackers to
access admin functions and have unspecified other impact, as
demonstrated by (1) an IdFlux request to supprimer_flux.php and (2) a
TpsRafraich request to modifier_tps_rafraich.php.
