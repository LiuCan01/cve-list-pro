Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Webmin 1.370 and 1.390 and
Usermin 1.300 and 1.320 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via the search parameter to webmin_search.cgi (aka
the search section), and possibly other components accessed through a
"search box" or "open file box." NOTE: some of these details are
obtained from third party information.
