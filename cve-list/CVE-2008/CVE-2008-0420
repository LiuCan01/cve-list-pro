modules/libpr0n/decoders/bmp/nsBMPDecoder.cpp in Mozilla Firefox
before 2.0.0.12, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.12, and SeaMonkey before
1.1.8 does not properly perform certain calculations related to the
mColors table, which allows remote attackers to read portions of
memory uninitialized via a crafted 8-bit bitmap (BMP) file that
triggers an out-of-bounds read within the heap, as demonstrated using
a CANVAS element; or cause a denial of service (application crash) via
a crafted 8-bit bitmap file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.
NOTE: the initial public reports stated that this affected Firefox in
Ubuntu 6.06 through 7.10.
