Argument injection vulnerability in the cai: URI handler in
rcplauncher in IBM Lotus Expeditor Client for Desktop 6.1.1 and 6.1.2,
as used by Lotus Symphony and possibly other products, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code by injecting a -launcher option
via a cai: URI, as demonstrated by a reference to a UNC share
pathname.
