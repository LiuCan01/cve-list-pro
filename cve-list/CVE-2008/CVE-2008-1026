Integer overflow in the PCRE regular expression compiler
(JavaScriptCore/pcre/pcre_compile.cpp) in Apple WebKit, as used in
Safari before 3.1.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a regular expression with large, nested repetition counts, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
