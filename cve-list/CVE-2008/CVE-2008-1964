** DISPUTED **

Stack-based buffer overflow in the demux_nsf_send_headers function in
src/demuxers/demux_nsf.c in xine-lib allows remote attackers to have
an unknown impact via a long copyright field in an NSF header in an
NES Sound file, a different issue than CVE-2008-1878.  NOTE: a third
party claims that the copyright field always has a safe length.
