Foxit Reader 2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PDF file with (1) a
malformed ExtGState resource containing a /Font resource, or (2) an
XObject resource with a Rotate setting, which triggers memory
corruption.  NOTE: this is probably a different vulnerability than
CVE-2007-2186.
