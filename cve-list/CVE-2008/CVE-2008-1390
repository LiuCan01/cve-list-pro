The AsteriskGUI HTTP server in Asterisk Open Source 1.4.x before
1.4.19-rc3 and 1.6.x before 1.6.0-beta6, Business Edition C.x.x before
C.1.6, AsteriskNOW before 1.0.2, Appliance Developer Kit before
revision 104704, and s800i 1.0.x before 1.1.0.2 generates
insufficiently random manager ID values, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to hijack a manager session via a series of ID
guesses.
