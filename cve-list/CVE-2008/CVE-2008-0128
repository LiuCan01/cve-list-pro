The SingleSignOn Valve
(org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn) in Apache Tomcat
before 5.5.21 does not set the secure flag for the JSESSIONIDSSO
cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in
http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this
cookie.
