The File Sharing pane in the Sharing preference pane in Apple Mac OS X
10.5 through 10.5.4 does not inform users that the complete contents
of their own home directories are shared for their own use, which
might allow attackers to leverage other vulnerabilities and access
files for which sharing was unintended.
