Tor before 0.2.0.32 does not properly process the
ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses configuration option in situations
where an exit relay issues a policy-based refusal of a stream, which
allows remote exit relays to have an unknown impact by mapping an
internal IP address to the destination hostname of a refused stream.
