Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ImageAlbum 2.0.0b2 allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the id, which
is not properly handled in (1) classes/IADomain.php, (2)
classes/IACollection.php, and (3) classes/IAUser.php, as demonstrated
via the id parameter in a collection.imageview action.
