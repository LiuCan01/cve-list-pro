Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebID/IISWebAgentIF.dll in
RSA Authentication Agent 5.3.0.258, and other versions before
5.3.3.378, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML via a URL-encoded postdata parameter.  NOTE: this is different
than CVE-2005-1118, but it might be the same as CVE-2008-1470.
