The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk Open Source 1.0.x,
1.2.x before 1.2.28, and 1.4.x before 1.4.19.1; Business Edition
A.x.x, B.x.x before B.2.5.2, and C.x.x before C.1.8.1; AsteriskNOW
before 1.0.3; Appliance Developer Kit 0.x.x; and s800i before 1.1.0.3,
when configured to allow unauthenticated calls, does not verify that
an ACK response contains a call number matching the server's reply to
a NEW message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed ACK response that does
not complete a 3-way handshake.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2008-1923.
