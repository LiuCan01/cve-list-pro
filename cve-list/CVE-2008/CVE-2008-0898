The distributed queue feature in JMS in BEA WebLogic Server 9.0
through 10.0, in certain configurations, does not properly handle when
a client cannot send a message to a member of a distributed queue,
which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access
restrictions for protected distributed queues.
