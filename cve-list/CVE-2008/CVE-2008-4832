rc.sysinit in initscripts 8.12-8.21 and 8.56.15-0.1 on rPath allows
local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a
directory under (1) /var/lock or (2) /var/run.  NOTE: this issue exists
because of a race condition in an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-3524.
NOTE: exploitation may require an unusual scenario in which rc.sysinit
is executed other than at boot time.
