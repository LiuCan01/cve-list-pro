WebCore in Apple Safari does not properly perform garbage collection
of JavaScript document elements, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap corruption
and application crash) via a reference to the ownerNode property of a
copied CSSStyleSheet object of a STYLE element, as originally
demonstrated on Apple iPhone before 2.0 and iPod touch before 2.0, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1590.
