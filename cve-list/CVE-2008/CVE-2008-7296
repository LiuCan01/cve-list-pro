Apple Safari cannot properly restrict modifications to cookies
established in HTTPS sessions, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to overwrite or delete arbitrary cookies via a Set-Cookie
header in an HTTP response, related to lack of the HTTP Strict
Transport Security (HSTS) includeSubDomains feature, aka a "cookie
forcing" issue.
