The dba_replace function in PHP 5.2.6 and 4.x allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (file truncation) via a key
with the NULL byte.  NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability in
limited circumstances in which the attacker can modify or add database
entries but does not have permissions to truncate the file.
