** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this
candidate was based on an incorrect claim regarding a directory issue
in Agavi.  The vendor has disputed the issue and the original
researcher has retracted the original claim, so this is not a
vulnerability.  Further investigation by the vendor and original
researcher show that the original issue was in a site-specific
modification, which is outside the scope of CVE.  Notes: CVE users
should not use this identifier.
