Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45791

Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.31 allows remote attackers
to bypass an IP address restriction and obtain sensitive information
via a request that is processed concurrently with another request but
in a different thread, leading to an instance-variable overwrite
associated with a "synchronization problem" and lack of thread safety,
and related to RemoteFilterValve, RemoteAddrValve, and
RemoteHostValve.
