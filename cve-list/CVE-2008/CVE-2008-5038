Use-after-free vulnerability in the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)
feature in Novell eDirectory 8.7.3 SP10 before 8.7.3 SP10 FTF1 and 8.8
SP2 for Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a sequence of "Get NCP
Extension Information By Name" requests that cause one thread to
operate on memory after it has been freed in another thread, which
triggers memory corruption, aka Novell Bug 373852.
