Reference: ISS:20000314 Vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Encryption Used to Store Administrative Login ID
Reference: BID:1055
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1055

When a new SQL Server is registered in Enterprise Manager for
Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and the "Always prompt for login name and
password" option is not set, then the Enterprise Manager uses weak
encryption to store the login ID and password.

 Christey> According to Scott Culp, this can only be reproduced if the
   SQL server is running in an unsafe mode that is not
   recommended by Microsoft: "To securely use SQL Server,
   Microsoft recommends using Windows Integrated Security. In
   Windows Integrated Security mode passwords are never stored,
   as your Windows Domain sign-on is used as the security
   identifier to the database server."
   
   We still must consider approving this candidate, however, as a
   user configuration error instead of a software flaw.
   CD:DESIGN-WEAK-ENCRYPTION applies in this case, so if we
   decide to include configuration problems in which a user
   intentionally selects weak encryption, then we might still
   approve this candidate.
