   Consider removing the security-express.com reference, since it is identical
   to the BugTraq reference. The BugTraq reference is (hopefully) not going to
   disappear soon, and the security-express.com reference provides no new or
   additional information.
 Christey> URLs will begin to be included with candidates to support
   Board members' voting activities.  They will be converted to
   the generalized reference format when if candidate is
   ACCEPTed and becomes an official entry.
 Christey> The problem may not be a lack of authentication (as mentioned
   by the poster), but rather weak authentication (the apparent
   need to provide the same username).
 Baker> MOdify description to indicate the weak authentication
