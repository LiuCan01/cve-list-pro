 Christey> Consult Microsoft on this one.
 LeBlanc> This one was already fixed in several hotfixes when it was
   found. I'm not sure what the content decision is on this. It is a valid
   problem, but it was already fixed when announced. I will go along with
   an accept vote once it is modified to show fixes.
