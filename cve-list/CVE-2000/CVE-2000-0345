Voter Comments:
 Levy> Arguably this is not a vulnerability. Cisco replying saying this
   is standard behaviour that was simply not well documented. They have
   no plans to change it and will simply document it better.
 Frech> XF:cisco-online-help
 Balinsky> As noted in a bugtraq posting by Lisa Napier from Cisco's Product Security Incident Response Team, this is a poorly documented feature. This is intended behavior, and does not represent a vulnerability in Cisco's opinion.

 Prosser> Although Lisa Napier did say this issue was "functioning as designed", it was not intended to allow unprivileged access.  Lisa did indicate that Cisco would be updating instructions on configuration to ensure proper user privileges.  So, this should be considered IMHO an "exposure" vice a vulnerability, but security-related none the less.
