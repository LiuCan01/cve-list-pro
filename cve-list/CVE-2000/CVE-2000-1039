Various TCP/IP stacks and network applications allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service by flooding a target host with TCP
connection attempts and completing the TCP/IP handshake without
maintaining the connection state on the attacker host, aka the
"NAPTHA" class of vulnerabilities.  NOTE: this candidate may change
significantly as the security community discusses the technical
nature of NAPTHA and learns more about the affected applications.
This candidate is at a higher level of abstraction than is typical for
CVE.

Voter Comments:
 Baker> Although this is at a high level, the fact is that it is a vulnerability, and as such we need to recognize this, even if we have to recast or modify the description at some later time.
 Christey> This needs to be commented on and reviewed by many Board
   members.
