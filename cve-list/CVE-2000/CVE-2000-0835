Voter Comments:
 Magdych> Unless the beta product is in very widespread use, or the product is in
   "perpetual beta" (e.g. ICQ), I would prefer not to include beta software.
 Christey> XF:sambar-search-view-folder
 Frech> XF:sambar-search-view-folder(5247)
 Baker> Unless we change our CD:EX-BETA, we should reject this entry.  Perhaps we need to address the issue of Beta software again, but the previous discussion was pretty thorough and I believe the editorial board was unanimous in excluding normal beta software.
 Christey> Fix typo: "paramater"
