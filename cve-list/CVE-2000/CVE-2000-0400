Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> COMMENT - this definately will not work if the user has applied the security
   patch. I don't know whether this repros right now, and have sent a query to
   find out.
 Christey> Is this now documented in MS:MS00-042?
 LeBlanc> the problem isn't in the Active Movie control.  What was
   observed was a symptom of another problem that got fixed in
   some bulletin or another - I don't remember.
 Christey> According to Scott Culp, this existed because 
   the patch for the Cache Bypass vulnerability (MS:MS00-046,
   CVE-2000-0621) was not applied, so this should be REJECTed
   as a duplicate of CVE-2000-0621.
