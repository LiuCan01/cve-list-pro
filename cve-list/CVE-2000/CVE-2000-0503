Voter Comments:
 Wall> This affects more than IE 5.01.  See http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1311 for
   all versions of IE that this affects.  Works on Windows 98, IE 5.01 and IE 5.5.
 LeBlanc> If this is the one I was discussing offline with Steve, ACCEPT
 Frech> XF:ie-cross-frame(4610)
 Christey> Make sure this is the one I was discussing offline with David :-)
 Frech> CVE-2000-0503 was reassigned to ie-frame-domain-file-access(5504) from
   ie-cross-frame(4610), which was obsoleted and redirected to this
   issue. Since these are the same issues but just described differently,
   CVE-2000-0503 appears to be a dupe of CVE-2000-0768.
