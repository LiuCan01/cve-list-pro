File and Print Sharing service in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows
Me does not properly check the password for a file share, which allows
remote attackers to bypass share access controls by sending a 1-byte
password that matches the first character of the real password, aka
the "Share Level Password" vulnerability.
