Voter Comments:
 Christey> In a followup to Bugtraq, Juan Carlos Cuartango makes some
   clarifications, specifically that the code that is executed
   *must* be signed by Microsoft.
   
   See BUGTRAQ:20000222 MS signed softwrare privileges
   
   Microsoft sends some followups, including a statement that it
   will include notification.
   
   The question is, does this belong in CVE?  There is no known
   means of exploitation; on the other hand, it is related
   to privacy concerns.  Several posts to the Bugtraq list
   indicate that some people believe that unprompted installation
   is a significant concern.
 Frech> XF:win-active-setup
 Levy> BID 999
   
   I do consider this vulnerability as it allows a malicious web page
   to install *old* and *vulnerable* components signed by microsoft.
 LeBlanc> Fixed in MS00-042
 Christey> BID:999
   Also add XF:ie-active-setup-download ?
