Voter Comments:
 Prosser> Although SCO is reporting the problem, there is too little info
   available to make an informed decision.  Unable to find anything
   anywhere on this.  It is an events logging system, so one would assume
   that there is a way to fill up the log and cause a system halt, but no
   way of confirming this with limited information.
 Christey> Perhaps we should create a content decision, say
   CD:VAGUE-ACK, which says whether it's reasonable to
   ACCEPT vendor-acknowledged problems that do not provide any
   salient details, as in this candidate as well as several
   others.
 Cole> I researched this a little more and you can change my NOOP to an
   ACCEPT
 Frech> XF:sco-eels-dos
