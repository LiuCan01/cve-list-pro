Voter Comments:
 Frech> How is this different from MITRE:CVE-2000-0162, other than the
   fact that it has an MS advisory that's vague on the reason but
   has the same outcome, and this one mentions the
   getSystemResourceAsStream function?
 Christey> This is a duplicate of CVE-2000-0162, as confirmed via David
   LeBlanc.  The descriptions of CVE-2000-0132 and CVE-2000-0162 were
   significantly different, as was the descriptive text of
   MS:MS00-011 and the original Bugtraq posting.  So this
   duplicate wasn't picked up before.   CVE-2000-0162 needs to be
   modified to include XF:virtual-machine-file-read as a
   reference.
 LeBlanc> Duplicate
 Christey> Ensure that CVE-2000-0162 uses msvm-java-file-read(4024) now,
   instead of virtual-machine-file-read(4577)
 Frech> If duplicate with CVE-2000-0098, shouldn't the references be
   moved over to the valid CVE number? Please advise.
 Christey> When CVE-2000-0132 is rejected, the references will be added
   to CVE-2000-0098.
