Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> I have no idea what this one is talking about from the description.  I also
   don't think it involves "Network Monitor", which is a component of Windows
   NT/Windows 2000. This should be clarified.
 Frech> XF:big-brother-bbd-bo
 Christey> The original advisory, as forwarded to Bugtraq, does not
   provide any details, so the description is necessarily vague.
   Also, the home page at http://bb4.com has it referring to
   itself as "Big Brother System and Network Monitor," so
   "Network Monitor" is apparently part of the name of the product.
   
   Change this description to mention version 1.4g, to distinguish
   from other Big Brother vulnerabilities.
