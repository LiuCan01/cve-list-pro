Voter Comments:
 Levy> There was plenty of people that could not reproduce the problem although
   some did. More research (as in actual testing) is probably required.
 LeBlanc> This entry does not specify which versions of Outloook are vulnerable, nor
   is that clear from the BUGTRAQ record. It is much too broad to say just
   "Outlook" when it is definately not all versions of Outlook. The problem
   appears confined to some version of Outlook 97, and if I recall correctly,
   there has been a patch for this for quite some time.

 CHANGE> [Wall changed vote from REVIEWING to RECAST]
 Wall> UNABLE TO DUPLICATE
