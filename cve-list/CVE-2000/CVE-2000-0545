   CVE-2000-0545 seems to be a dupe of CVE-1999-0125 (Buffer overflow in SGI
   IRIX mailx program) since they both allow 'mail' group privileges. There was
   no exploit for SGI's vuln to compare.
 Christey> Since we are taking a split-by-default approach when
   there are insufficient details, we should keep this
   separate from CVE-1999-0125.  The difference in the
   time of discovery is also a factor, even if these wind
   up being the same problem.  However, there just aren't
   enough details to be sure if this is the same problem or not.
 Christey> On June 25, 1998, a buffer overflow in mailx via the HOME
   environmental variable was posted at:
   BUGTRAQ:19980625 security hole in mailx
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=90221103125955&w=2
   
   This affected multiple OSes.
   
   SGI:19980605-01-PX (CVE-1999-0125) was published on September
   29, 1998; while the advisory is short on details, it does
   mention a buffer overflow.
   
   So, there's enough distinction here (time and what gets
   exploited) to say that these should remain split; but
   CVE-1999-0125 likely needs to be RECAST to mention other
   affected OSes.
