Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Baker, Mell
   NOOP(3) Cole, Collins, Wall

Voter Comments:
 Collins> Assigning CVE numbers for demo software is not appropriate
 Baker> Was this a beta version in the demo disk?  I don't think it was.  While we do have an exclusion for beta software,
   software that is distributed as production software, just limited in scope, does not mean beta..
   The current version is 4, but it is still offered for free download from their website for use.
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]
 Baker> SHould change vote from review to accept
