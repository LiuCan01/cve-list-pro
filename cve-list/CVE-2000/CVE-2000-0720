news.cgi in GWScripts News Publisher does not properly authenticate
requests to add an author to the author index, which allows remote
attackers to add new authors by directly posting an HTTP request to
the new.cgi program with an addAuthor parameter, and setting the
Referer to the news.cgi program.
