The line printer daemon (lpd) in the lpr package in multiple Linux
operating systems authenticates by comparing the reverse-resolved
hostname of the local machine to the hostname of the print server as
returned by gethostname, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended access controls by modifying the DNS for the attacking IP.
