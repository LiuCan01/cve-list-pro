Voter Comments:
 Frech> This reference to NTBugtraq has a message that ends with "Can anyone
   reproduce this?", and there are no followups. This makes for a weak
   reference. There are also no other references listed for this CAN.
 LeBlanc> - no follow-ups, no KB article, no fix
 CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
