Voter Comments:
 Frech> ADDREF XF:hp-aserver
 Christey> The Bugtraq posting does not mention specific versions.
   Is June 1999 equivalent to HP-UX 10.x?
 Prosser> The HP Bulletin (already ref'd) just specifies 10.x and 11.x OS versions running on HP9000 700/800 series.  According to Tripp (bugtraq), the audio server doesn't run on a machine without Audio Hardware (logical).  So one has to assume from the bulletin that any 9000 with audio hardware that is running a 10.x or 11.x version of OS with either the 98 or 99 version of Aserver loaded will be vulnerable to either the exploit in CVE-1999-0005(the 98 version of Aserver) or CVE-2000-0078 (the 99 version)and should take appropriate action.  No patches out from HP as of 10/2/2000 so either remove the program or tighten the permissions considerably.

   Make sure not dupe's with CVE-2000-0005 and CVE-20000-0077.
