   We show this issue to be cross-Linux-platform and not Caldera specific. May
   also be a LOA issue or duplicate or specific instance of CVE-2000-0531. This
   position is further validated by BID-1512 and BID-1377, which lists this as
   a Conectiva Linux/Mandrake issue and list Mandrake:MDKSA-2000:025 in common.
   We will list both CVEs under the listed XF tag unless otherwise instructed.
