Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> - same as CVE-1999-1011
   If I'm misunderstanding something here, please correct me.  In fact, it has
   the same bulletin as a reference.
 Frech> XF:jet-vba-shell
 Prosser> This entry is not the same as "now" CVE-1999-1011. That entry is "The Remote Data Service (RDS) DataFactory component of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) in IIS 3.x and 4.x exposes unsafe methods, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands."  This one should be correct.

   NTBUGTRAQ:19990526 Advisory: NT ODBC Remote Compromise
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ntbugtraq&m=92781907215748&w=2
 Christey> The Microsoft advisory itself describes two separate
   vulnerabilities, calling the TEXT I-ISAM problem
   (CVE-2000-0323) a variant of the VBA Shell problem (this
   CAN).  In addition, CVE-2000-0323 does *not* appear in Jet
   4.0, while this one does.  Since one problem appears in a
   different version than the other, CD:SF-LOC suggests keeping
   these candidates SPLIT.

 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> Need to clarify whether the Bugtraq/NTBugtraq posts are
   really describing the same issue (those are BID:286).
