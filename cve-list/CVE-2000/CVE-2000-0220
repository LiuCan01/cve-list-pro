Voter Comments:
 Blake> Discussion on Bugtraq shows that this is a really marginal issue.  Very
   tough to come up with a viable attack scenario.  Also, it's part of how
   this class of software works, not a flaw in the cited package.  Might be
   possible to recast this into something more generic....
