   REJECT(3) Baker, Frech, Levy

Voter Comments:
 Frech> Does not meet CVE candidate requirements. The problem was remedied on the
   server end, and no fault exists at the client. Based on
   http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2000-03/0299.html:
   Approximately one hour after receiving the post from BugTraq, 
   Napster's servers were patched to prevent this from occurring. 
   Users of the Napster Win32 client software are NOT vulnerable. 
 Baker> Agree with Andre
