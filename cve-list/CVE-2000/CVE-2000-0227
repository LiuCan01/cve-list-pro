The Linux 2.2.x kernel does not restrict the number of Unix domain
sockets as defined by the wmem_max parameter, which allows local users
to cause a denial of service by requesting a large number of sockets.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> Fix typo: 'paremeter'
 Magdych> I remember when this came up...  seems like there were some wildly
   mixed results for the exploit.
 Christey> See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=95421263519558&w=2
   for Elias' summary of the mixed results.  It looks like
   enough people were able to replicate it that we should
   include it.
 Christey> Fix typo: "paremeter"
 CHANGE> [Magdych changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
