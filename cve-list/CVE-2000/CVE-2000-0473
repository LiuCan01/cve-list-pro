 Christey> Appears to be the same as, or similar to, CVE-2000-0011, which was
   also discovered by USSR.  Comments on the AnalogX web site are
   decidedly sparse.  In CVE-2000-0011, USSR only claims that
   the vendor was informed, so is this still the same problem?

   Please review whether your BUGTRAQ:19991231 reference is correct; seems like
   this is the reference to CVE-2000-0011: Buffer overflow in AnalogX
   SimpleServer:WWW HTTP server allows remote attackers to execute commands via
   a long GET request. They are subtle; almost the only thing that changed was
   the version.
   A possible reference is "Remote DoS attack in AnalogX SimpleServer WWW
   Version 1.05 Vulnerability" at http://www.ussrback.com/labs45.html.
