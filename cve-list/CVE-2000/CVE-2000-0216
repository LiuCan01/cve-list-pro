Reference: NTBUGTRAQ:20000229 mailbombing DoS easily exploitable against mail systems using MS mail clients.
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/ntbugtraq/2000-q1/0176.html

Microsoft email clients in Outlook, Exchange, and Windows Messaging
automatically respond to Read Receipt and Delivery Receipt tags, which
could allow an attacker to flood a mail system with responses by
forging a Read Receipt request that is redirected to a large
distribution list.

Voter Comments:
 Blake> This is a configuration issue.  Should the fact that NT can be configured
   to accept a blank Admin password have a CVE entry?
 LeBlanc> This is documented as bad practice - if you have a wide distribution
   mailing list, you should only allow certain users to send mail to it.
   I don't think we want to start listing all possible admin errors as
   vulnerabilities.
 Frech> XF:microsoft-mail-client-dos(4893)
 Levy> I agree with all the above comments. Furthermore the delivery status
   notification RFC makes it clear that mailing list software should
   strip messages from DSN headers. I assume Microsoft's products are
   using the DSN standard and not something else.
