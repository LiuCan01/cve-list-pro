 Christey> In an email to issforum@iss.net on September 7, 2000, ISS says
   that Network Sensor 3.2.2 is affected by SYN flooding, but
   RealSecure 5.0 is not affected by Syn flooding.  In addition,
   they could not find conclusive evidence that RS 3.2.2 or 5.0
   was affected by IP fragmentation.  This seems to indicate
   that there are 2 *possible* problems: syn flooding (acknowledged
   by ISS) and fragmentation (unconfirmed).  Perhaps this
   candidate needs to be split, or its description should be
   rewritten to separate the 2 reported problems.
