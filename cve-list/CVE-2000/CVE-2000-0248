   In description, passowrd should be password.
 Cox> The "execute arbitrary commands" part is a seperate vulnerability,
   already assigned CVE-2000-0322.  The package was designed to have no
   password on installation, so "backdoor" does not apply.  When users
   install Piranha they are expected to add a password to the web
   administration GUI, it's a documented part of the procedure.  "The web
   GUI for the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) software in the Red Hat Linux
   Piranha package installs with a default password" is accurate if it
   qualifies as an exposure.

   Default accounts/passwords need to be accounted for in CVE,
   but the question is what level of abstraction to use - a
   separate CVE for each password, or one CVE for all passwords,
   or somewhere in the middle?  That is the crux of CD:CF-PASS.
