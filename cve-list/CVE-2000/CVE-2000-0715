   The advisory addresses some diskcheck symlink vulnerability,
   but the initial announcement was 4 months before the advisory
   was released; however, the DiskCheck versions seem to
   correspond.
 Christey> See various Bugtraq posts relating to this, and verify if the
   Conectiva/Red Hat/etc. advisories are really addressing this
   particular problem.

 Christey> The following RedHat advisory appears to identify the same
   problem as one that was posted to Bugtraq on August 8, 2000:
   REDHAT:RHSA-2000:122-06
   http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/powertools/RHSA-2000-122.html
   
   See the following BugID, as referenced in the advisory:
   http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11724
   So, add:
   BID:2050
   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/2050
   XF:linux-diskcheck-race-symlink
   URL:http://xforce.iss.net/static/5624.php
   
   [note the apparent BID duplicates, however]
