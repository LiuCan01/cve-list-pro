The registry entry for the Windows Shell executable (Explorer.exe) in
Windows NT and Windows 2000 uses a relative path name, which allows
local users to execute arbitrary commands by inserting a Trojan Horse
named Explorer.exe into the %Systemdrive% directory, aka the "Relative
Shell Path" vulnerability.
