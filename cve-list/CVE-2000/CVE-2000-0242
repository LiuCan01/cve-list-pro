Voter Comments:
 Frech> Violation of fundamentum divisionis (that is, it's more than one issue) and
   a potential nitpick:
   - windmail-fileread: allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files
   - windmail-pipe-command: execute commands via shell metacharacters
   - The conjunction 'or' should be 'and', if you decide to stick with one CAN.
 Christey> As Andre basically said without naming content decisions,
   CD:SF-LOC says this should be split.
   
   HOWEVER - the author of the product says that WindMail isn't
   supposed to be a CGI script, and says that the pipe 
   character problem is not related to Geocel.  So should CVE
   record when someone runs a program that wasn't intended to
   be a CGI?  There may be a level of abstraction issue here.
   Note that Perl and shell interpreters in CGI-BIN are 
   already mentioned in CVE-1999-0509.  If we want to include
   "using a program that wasn't designed to be a CGI" as a
   problem, we should have a separate candidate.

   which also claims that the original announcer hasn't provided
   any more details after the author was unable to reproduce the
   problem.
 CHANGE> [Magdych changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Magdych> After reviewing the author's comments, I'm inclined to think that this is more of a misconfiguration than a vulnerability.
