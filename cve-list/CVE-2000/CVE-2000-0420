Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> This is not a vulnerability.  It is essentially an advisory on best
   practices. Also, the description is extremely inaccurate. If I weren't
   intimately familiar with the issue, I would not be able to understand it
   from this. Syskey, when applied at lower levels, has well-documented
   limitations.  
 Stracener> "..to recover"
 Frech> XF:win2k-syskey-default-configuration
   Change "tor ecover" to "to recover"
