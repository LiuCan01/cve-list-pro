Reference: BUGTRAQ:20000620 BlackICE by Network ICE Corp vulnerability against Back Orifice 1.2
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2000-06/0190.html

BlackIce Defender 2.1 and earlier, and BlackIce Pro 2.0.23 and
earlier, do not properly block Back Orifice traffic when the security
setting is Nervous or lower.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Armstrong, Cole, Levy
   MODIFY(2) Baker, Frech
   NOOP(1) Ozancin
   REVIEWING(1) Christey

Voter Comments:
 Levy> What do others think? Should this be a vuln? I can see the argument
   that some features are simply not available unless you use the maximum
   security settings.
 Christey> At the very least, this needs to be modified to state that
   this problem/concern applies to high ports in general, not
   just Back orifice.
   
   The Bugtraq poster claims that BlackICE "shuts down" the port, 
   but only *after* some initial traffic "leaks" out.  This may
   be by design, but it does mean that there is a small window
   of opportunity in which BlackICE may not work "as
   advertised," even at lower security settings.

 CHANGE> [Levy changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Baker> I accept it more as a security exposure, than a real vulnerability.
   It performs just as any other "firewall" or IDS product can be configured to
   allow traffic without notifying the user. You can adjust settings on
   any product that allow traffic that other people or organizations would
   find unacceptable.  So, as long as it is reflected that this is more of
   a configuration that allows such traffic as opposed to a defective
   or improperly functioning software issue, I don't have a problem with
   it.
