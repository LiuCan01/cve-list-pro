   I reviewed the patch that was claimed in the 20020119 Bugtraq
   post, and it could well address the issue.  However, since the
   patch is also dated around the time of the original Bugtraq
   post, *and* it says that it's addressing an issue that's
   discussed on Bugtraq, that is sufficient to establish
   acknowledgement.
