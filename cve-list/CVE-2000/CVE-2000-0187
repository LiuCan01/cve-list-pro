EZShopper 3.0 loadpage.cgi CGI script allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) attack or execute commands via
shell metacharacters.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Levy, Ozancin
   MODIFY(1) Frech
   NOOP(6) Baker, Blake, Christey, Cole, LeBlanc, Wall

Voter Comments:
 Christey> Since EZShopper is written in Perl, there is strong evidence
   that both the .. and metacharacter attack probably go
   through the same insecure open() call.  (Perl's open can
   either read a regular file, or read piped output from
   a command that is specified to the open).
