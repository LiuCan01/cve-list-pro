Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> I think this is the same as
   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-010.asp
   If that is true, and you already have it logged, we don't want to have an
   entry for the same bug.
 Christey> MS:MS99-010 describes CVE-1999-0386.  Are there sufficient
   details to ensure that this is the same problem?
   
   See http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&msg=01bae51a$9ab232b0$0100007f@nordnode

   (We currently have this issue assigned to this CAN and to CVE-1999-0386. I
   see that others have similar concerns that this is a duplicate; please
   confirm on current status of this candidate.)
