Windows 2000 Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service by sending a continuous stream of binary zeros to various TCP
and UDP ports, which significantly increases the CPU utilization.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Cole, Frech, Levy
   REJECT(2) LeBlanc, Magdych
   REVIEWING(1) Wall

Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> Insufficient data.  Most of their claims are not reproducible. You can,
   however, DoS the telnet server this way. As far as I know, there is no repro
   on any of the other ports. I am not sure of fix status at this time
   (7/19/00). Also overlaps with CVE-2000-0581
 CHANGE> [Magdych changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
 Magdych> The only independent verification of these claims I have heard is for the Telnet denial of service, which is already defined in CVE candidate CVE-2000-0581.
 Frech> Replace win2k-cpu-overload-dos(4824) with win2k-telnetserver-dos(4823)
