Reference: XF:iis-shtml-reveal-path

The shtml.exe program in the FrontPage extensions package of IIS 4.0
and 5.0 allows remote attackers to determine the physical path of
HTML, HTM, ASP, and SHTML files by requesting a file that does not
exist, which generates an error message that reveals the path.
