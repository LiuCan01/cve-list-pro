Buffer overflows in Microsoft Network Monitor (Netmon) allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a long Browser Name in a
CIFS Browse Frame, a long SNMP community name, or a long username or
filename in an SMB session, aka the "Netmon Protocol Parsing"
vulnerability.  NOTE: It is highly likely that this candidate will be
split into multiple candidates.
