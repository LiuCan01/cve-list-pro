of service.

   As of this writing, it is not certain which candidate
   should be preferred: the candidate that has been publicly
   known longer (i.e. CVE-2000-0756), or the more "official"
   candidate, which has probably been publicized more (i.e.
   CVE-2001-0145).
 Frech> XF:outlook-vcard-dos(5175)
   XF:outlook-vcard-bo(6145)
   Because there's another more recent CAN linked to @stake and
   Microsoft's advisories, we'll link both of our records to both
   candiates until a final decision occurs. If a decision has been made
   to promote the CVE-2001 entry, then enter my vote as a REJECT for
   CVE-2000-0756.
 Frech> Replace outlook-vcard-bo(6145) with outlook-vcard-dos(5175)
