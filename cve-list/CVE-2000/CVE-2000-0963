 Christey> Various vendor writeups indicate that there are multiple
   overflows, so maybe this needs to be SPLIT.

 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> This is all a library issue in which TERM/TERMINFO_DIRS are
   one possible attack vector, but another is through entries
   in the .terminfo file.  Add .terminfo and termcap to the
   description, as well as libncurses.

   Now need to examine whether this is a dupe of CVE-2002-0062,
   and/or BID:2116.  There's certainly enough confusion to go
   around.
 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
 Christey> This is not a dupe of CVE-2002-0062.  As explained in
   DEBIAN:DSA-113, the original patches for CVE-2000-0963
   didn't catch every problem.
