Variant of the "IIS Cross-Site Scripting" vulnerability as originally
discussed in MS:MS00-060 (CVE-2000-0746) allows a malicious web site
operator to embed scripts in a link to a trusted site, which are
returned without quoting in an error message back to the client.  The
client then executes those scripts in the same context as the trusted
site.
