   The real problem seems to be with the Windows API call, not the Serv-U FTP
   app. As the "Windows Api SHGetPathFromIDList Buffer Overflow" reference
   states, [The bug can] "cause whatever handles the shortcuts to crash."
   As a suggestion, rephrase the description from Windows's context, and state
   that the Serv-U FTP server is an example of an app that exhibits this
   problem.
 Wall> Comment:  the original UssrLabs advisory does mention the SHGetPathFromIDList
   buffer overflow in a Windows API and that Serv-U FTP uses this API to cause the
   problem.  The problem does not exist on Windows 2000.  The solution seems to be
   in a new release of Serv-U FTP.

   Reports indicate that while the vulnerable function was found in Serv-U FTP
   server, the function is actually from Microsoft, and as such may affect other
   applications.
