Reference: XF:linux-pam-sniff-activities

The pam_console PAM module in Linux systems performs a chown on
various devices upon a user login, but an open file descriptor for
those devices can be maintained after the user logs out, which allows
that user to sniff activity on these devices when subsequent users log
in.
