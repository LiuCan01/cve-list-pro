Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:majordomo-local-resend
 Christey> The Bugtraq thread indicates that this problem may be
   due to misconfiguration, and may extend beyond just the
   resend command.
 CHANGE> [Armstrong changed vote from REVIEWING to NOOP]
 Christey> Include "wrapper" to facilitate search and matching?  (but
   double-check CVE-2000-0037).
   Add "1.94.4 and earlier" as the affected version number.
