 Frech> XF:sunjava-webadmin-bbs(5135)
 Levy> BID 1600
 Frech> We also show this associated with CVE-2000-0629: The default
   configuration of the Sun Java web server 2.0 and earlier allows remote
   attackers to execute arbitrary commands by uploading Java code to the
   server via board.html, then directly calling the JSP compiler
   servlet. CVE web site concurs.
 Christey> I think that Casper Dik confirmed that CVE-2000-0629 is a
   configuration problem, and this one is a bug, so they are
   different problems.  I need to dig up that email, though...
 Dik> CVE-2000-0629 indeed is about sample code which shouldn't
   be run on prodution servers
   This one is an actual bug and patches have been produced
   for JWS 2.0 and 1.1.3
