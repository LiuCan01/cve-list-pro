crontab by Paul Vixie uses predictable file names for a temporary file
and does not properly ensure that the file is owned by the user
executing the crontab -e command, which allows local users with write
access to the crontab spool directory to execute arbitrary commands by
creating world-writeable temporary files and modifying them while the
victim is editing the file.
