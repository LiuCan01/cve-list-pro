 Christey> This is a duplicate of CVE-2000-0156.  The FAQ at
   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-009.asp.
   says "the vulnerability requires Active Scripting" and
   "it is possible, under very specific conditions, to violate IE's
   cross-domain security model."  Also says "the redirect is made, via
   the <IMG SRC> HTML tag"
   
   Need to copy these references over to CVE-2000-0156.
