IIS 4.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the internal IP address of
the server via an HTTP 1.0 request for a web page which is protected
by basic authentication and has no realm defined.

Voter Comments:
 Christey> ADDREF http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q218/1/80.ASP
   
   Change description to point out that the internal IP address
   exposure is due to the default configuration as opposed to
   a bug.

 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> There are two variants of the same type of issue here.  The
   KB article shows that IIS 4.0 reveals the IP address in a
   Content-Location MIME header field.  The NTBugtraq article
   says that the IP address is shown in the WWW-Authenticate
   MIME header.  Which one has been fixed, or both, and when?
 Christey> MSKB:Q218180 identifies a problem in which IIS returns the
   info in a Content-Location header, but the authentication
   realm problem is not specifically mentioned.  Are these the
   same problem?
