Current Votes:
   NOOP(4) Armstrong, Baker, Christey, Stracener
   REJECT(2) Frech, Levy

Voter Comments:
 Christey> It's not certain whether this is exploitable or not.  An 
   expert (the linuxconf author?) wasn't able to duplicate the
   bug - see http://lwn.net/1999/1223/a/linuxconfresponse.html
   
   The original posting with example exploit was
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=94580196627059&w=2
   
   However - GIAC and the Security Focus incidents list have
   consistently reported that scans are taking place for
   linuxconf, so do the hackers know more than we do?
 Frech> Unless vendor or other confirmation occurs, there has been no corroboration
   of this issue in public forums.
 CHANGE> [Armstrong changed vote from ACCEPT to NOOP]
