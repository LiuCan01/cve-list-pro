 Frech> XF:sol-chkperm-bo(3870)
 Dik> chkperm runs set-uid bin, so initially the access granted
   will be user bin, not root.  (Though bin access can easily be leveraged
   to root access, less so in Solaris 8+)
   Also, there is reason to believe this bug is not exploitable; the buffer
   overflown is declared in the stack in main(); yet, the program never
   returns from main() but calls exit instead so any damage to return addresses
   is never noticed.
 Baker> Maybe the details from Caspar could be included, or modify the description somewhat
