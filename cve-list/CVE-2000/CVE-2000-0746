Vulnerabilities in IIS 4.0 and 5.0 do not properly protect against
cross-site scripting (CSS) attacks.  They allow a malicious web site
operator to embed scripts in a link to a trusted site, which are
returned without quoting in an error message back to the client.  The
client then executes those scripts in the same context as the trusted
site, aka the "IIS Cross-Site Scripting" vulnerabilities.

 CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
 Christey> A re-release of MS:MS00-060 indicates that a new variant of
   this problem was discovered, but the advisory does not
   provide sufficient details to distinguish it from this
   candidate.  A new candidate is being created, but the 
   description can't be written without mentioning this CAN.
