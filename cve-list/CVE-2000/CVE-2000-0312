   Seems like this issue is not just OpenBSD, and is described
   differently by other vendors:
   SuSE Security Announcement #15	Security hole in cron
   http://www.suse.de/de/support/security/suse_security_announce_15.txt
   Red Hat, Inc. Security Advisory RHSA-1999:030-02	Buffer overflow in
   cron daemon
   http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/rh52-errata-general.html#vixie-cron
   Caldera Systems, Inc. Security Advisory CSSA-1999-023.0	serious security
   problem in cron
   http://www.calderasystems.com/support/security/advisories/CSSA-1999-023.0.tx
   t
   All are dated on or around 1999-08-27 to 1999-08-30.
   Also, may overlap with CVE-1999-0769: Vixie Cron on Linux systems allows
   local users to set parameters of sendmail commands via the MAILTO
   environmental variable.
 Christey> See Andre's comments, but I believe this is different than
   CVE-1999-0769.  Also consider CVE-1999-0768 and CVE-1999-0872
   (Vixie Cron buffer overflow via MAILTO),
