Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:alibaba-get-dos(4934)
 Christey> This is in a relatively old Nessus plugin, though the exploit
   uses POST instead of GET.  This was probably discovered
   earlier than the references indicate.
 CHANGE> [Wall changed vote from NOOP to ACCEPT]
 Wall> Found by Arne Vidstrom and found in multiple sources

   One poster says that a large number of sites are running
   Alibaba (based on a netcraft report), but I'm not 100%
   sure Netcraft's doing a good job of identifying Alibaba
   servers.
