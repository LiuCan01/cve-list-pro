Voter Comments:
 LeBlanc> The poster re-discovered a vulnerability we patched two years
   ago, in
   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-008.asp
   Microsoft posted a response to BugTraq when this one went
   public, and reminded them that we'd already patched it.
   
   BTW, I think we want to try and pay attention to follow-ups to
   these threads in order to minimize noise in the process.
 Christey> Based on David's comments, this is covered by CVE-1999-0002.
   However, that candidate may wind up being SPLIT, so I will
   keep this one around for the moment.
   
   With respect to watching followups, we are relying quite
   a bit on other data feeds instead of doing our own reviews
   of all the different data sources.  The data feeds may report
   these problems as new before corrections are posted.
   Followups do often lend additional information to the
   candidates, and as is the case with this one, we will
   often catch the discrepancy before the candidate becomes an
   official entry, whether by MITRE's own analysis or by that
   of other Board members.
