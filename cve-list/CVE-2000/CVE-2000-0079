Current Votes:
   MODIFY(2) Baker, Frech
   NOOP(2) Christey, Williams
   RECAST(1) LeBlanc

Voter Comments:
 Frech> XF:w3c-httpd-reveal-paths
 LeBlanc> Title references IIS, vuln references W3C CERN httpd. Which
   one is broken?
 Christey> The mention of CERN httpd was buried in a followup on a
   description of an IIS problem, so this is the correct reference.
 Baker> Will the XF reference be added?
