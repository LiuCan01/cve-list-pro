 Collins> http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Src/Doc/
 Christey> The change log for htgrep acknowledges the problem, but it
   says that the qry tag is also affected.  CD:SF-LOC says that
   multiple problems of the same type in the same version should
   be combined, so this candidate should get a "soft recast"
   and qry should be added to the description.
