** DISPUTED **

lxsession-logout in lxsession in LXDE, as used on SUSE openSUSE 11.3
and other platforms, does not lock the screen when the Suspend or
Hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically
proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume
action.  NOTE: there is no general agreement that this is a
vulnerability, because separate control over locking can be an equally
secure, or more secure, behavior in some threat environments.
