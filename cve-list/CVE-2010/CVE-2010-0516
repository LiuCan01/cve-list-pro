Heap-based buffer overflow in QuickTime in Apple Mac OS X before
10.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service (application crash) via a crafted movie file with
RLE encoding, which triggers memory corruption when the length of
decompressed data exceeds that of the allocated heap chunk.
