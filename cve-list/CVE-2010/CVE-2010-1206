The startDocumentLoad function in browser/base/content/browser.js in
Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.11 and 3.6.x before 3.6.7, and
SeaMonkey before 2.0.6, does not properly implement the Same Origin
Policy in certain circumstances related to the about:blank document
and a document that is currently loading, which allows (1) remote web
servers to conduct spoofing attacks via vectors involving a 204 (aka
No Content) status code, and allows (2) remote attackers to conduct
spoofing attacks via vectors involving a window.stop call.
