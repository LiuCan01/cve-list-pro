Opera before 10.53 on Windows and Mac OS X does not properly handle a
series of document modifications that occur asynchronously, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (application crash) via JavaScript that writes <marquee>
sequences in an infinite loop, leading to attempted use of
uninitialized memory.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2006-6955.
