istream.c in w3m 0.5.2 and possibly other versions, when
ssl_verify_server is enabled, does not properly handle a '0'
character in a domain name in the (1) subject's Common Name or (2)
Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a
crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a
related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
