IrfanView before 4.27 does not properly handle an unspecified integer
variable during processing of PSD images, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file that triggers a
heap-based buffer overflow, related to a "sign-extension error."
