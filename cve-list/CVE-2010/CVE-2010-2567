The RPC client implementation in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3 and
Server 2003 SP2 does not properly allocate memory during the parsing
of responses, which allows remote RPC servers and man-in-the-middle
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed response, aka "RPC
Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
