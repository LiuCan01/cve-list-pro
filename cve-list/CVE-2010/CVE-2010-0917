Stack-based buffer overflow in VBScript in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4,
XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP2, when Internet Explorer is used,
might allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a long string in the fourth argument (aka helpfile argument) to
the MsgBox function, leading to code execution when the F1 key is
pressed, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0483.
