Unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component in Oracle Java
SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.
Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable third party
coordinator that the ActiveX Plugin does not properly initialize an
object field that is used as a window handle, which allows attackers
to execute arbitrary code.
