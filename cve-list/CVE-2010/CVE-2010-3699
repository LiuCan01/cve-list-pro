The backend driver in Xen 3.x allows guest OS users to cause a denial
of service via a kernel thread leak, which prevents the device and
guest OS from being shut down or create a zombie domain, causes a hang
in zenwatch, or prevents unspecified xm commands from working
properly, related to (1) netback, (2) blkback, or (3) blktap.
