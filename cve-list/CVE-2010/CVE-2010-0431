QEMU-KVM, as used in the Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor) in Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2 and KVM 83, does not properly
validate guest QXL driver pointers, which allows guest OS users to
cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and guest OS
crash) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
