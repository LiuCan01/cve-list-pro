The SMB client in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 does
not properly handle (1) SMBv1 and (2) SMBv2 response packets, which
allows remote SMB servers and man-in-the-middle attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a crafted packet that causes the client to read the
entirety of the response, and then improperly interact with the
Winsock Kernel (WSK), aka "SMB Client Message Size Vulnerability."
