An ActiveX control in RealNetworks RealPlayer 11.0 through 11.1,
RealPlayer SP 1.0 through 1.1.4, and RealPlayer Enterprise 2.1.2 does
not properly initialize an unspecified object component during parsing
of a CDDA URI, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
or cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and
application crash) via a long URI.
