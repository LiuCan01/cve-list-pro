LibTIFF 3.9.0 ignores tags in certain situations during the first
stage of TIFF file processing and does not properly handle this during
the second stage, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via a crafted file, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2010-2481.
