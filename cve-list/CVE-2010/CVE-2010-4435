Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Solaris 8, 9, and 10 allows remote
attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
related to CDE Calendar Manager Service Daemon and RPC.  NOTE: the
previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle
has not commented on claims from other software vendors that this
affects other operating systems, such as HP-UX, or claims from a
reliable third party that this is a buffer overflow in rpc.cmsd via
long XDR-encoded ASCII strings in RPC call 10.
