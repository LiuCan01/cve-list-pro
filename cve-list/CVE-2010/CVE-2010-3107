A certain ActiveX control in ienipp.ocx in the browser plugin in
Novell iPrint Client before 5.42 does not properly restrict the set of
files to be deleted, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (recursive file deletion) via unspecified vectors related
to a "logic flaw" in the CleanUploadFiles method in the nipplib.dll
module.
