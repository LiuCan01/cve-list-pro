Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the
Integrated Solutions Console (aka administrative console) in IBM
WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0.0.13 and earlier allow remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests
that disable certain security options via an Edit action to
console/adminSecurityDetail.do followed by a save action to
console/syncworkspace.do.
