The dirapi.dll module in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.9.620
allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) via a Director movie with an IFWV chunk
with a size field of 0, which is used in the calculation of a file
offset and causes invalid data to be used as a loop counter,
triggering a heap-based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2010-2587 and CVE-2010-2588.
