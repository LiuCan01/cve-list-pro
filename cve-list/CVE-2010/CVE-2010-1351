Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Nodesforum 1.033
and 1.045, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1)
_nodesforum_path_from_here_to_nodesforum_folder parameter to
erase_user_data.php and the (2) _nodesforum_code_path parameter to
pre_output.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
