Web Application Finger Printer (WAFP) 0.01-26c3 uses fixed pathnames
under /tmp for temporary files and directories, which (1) allows local
users to cause a denial of service (application outage) by creating a
file with a pathname that the product expects is available for its own
internal use, (2) allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via
symlink attacks on certain files in /tmp, (3) might allow local users
to delete arbitrary files and directories via a symlink attack on a
directory under /tmp, and (4) might make it easier for local users to
obtain sensitive information by reading files in a directory under
/tmp, related to (a) lib/wafp_pidify.rb, (b)
utils/generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh, (c) utils/online_update.sh, and
(d) utils/extract_from_db.sh.
