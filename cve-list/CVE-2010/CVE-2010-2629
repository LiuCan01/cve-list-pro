The Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS) 11500 with software 8.20.4.02
and the Application Control Engine (ACE) 4710 with software A2(3.0) do
not properly handle LF header terminators in situations where the GET
line is terminated by CRLF, which allows remote attackers to conduct
HTTP request smuggling attacks and possibly bypass intended header
insertions via crafted header data, as demonstrated by an LF character
between the ClientCert-Subject and ClientCert-Subject-CN headers.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2010-1576.
