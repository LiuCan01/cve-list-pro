Untrusted search path vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Contacts
allows local users, and possibly remote attackers, to execute
arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse
wab32res.dll that is located in the same folder as a .contact, .group,
.p7c, .vcf, or .wab file.  NOTE: the codebase for this product may
overlap the codebase for the product referenced in CVE-2010-3147.
