Cisco IOS XR 3.4.0 through 3.9.1, when BGP is enabled, does not
properly handle unrecognized transitive attributes, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peering reset) via a
crafted prefix announcement, as demonstrated in the wild in August
2010 with attribute type code 99, aka Bug ID CSCti62211.
