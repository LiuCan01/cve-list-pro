The Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS) 11500 with software 08.20.1.01
conveys authentication data through ClientCert-* headers but does not
delete client-supplied ClientCert-* headers, which might allow remote
attackers to bypass authentication via crafted header data, as
demonstrated by a ClientCert-Subject-CN header, aka Bug ID CSCsz04690.
