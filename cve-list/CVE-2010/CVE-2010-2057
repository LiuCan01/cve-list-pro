shared/util/StateUtils.java in Apache MyFaces 1.1.x before 1.1.8,
1.2.x before 1.2.9, and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 uses an encrypted View
State without a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which makes it
easier for remote attackers to perform successful modifications of the
View State via a padding oracle attack.
