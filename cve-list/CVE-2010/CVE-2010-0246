Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 does not properly handle objects in
memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
accessing an object that (1) was not properly initialized or (2) is
deleted, leading to memory corruption, aka "Uninitialized Memory
Corruption Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than
CVE-2009-3671, CVE-2009-3674, and CVE-2010-0245.
