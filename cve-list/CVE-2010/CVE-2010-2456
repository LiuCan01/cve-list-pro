Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in Linker
IMG 1.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to read and execute
arbitrary local files via a URL in the (1) cook_lan cookie parameter
($lan_dir variable) or possibly (2) Sdb_type parameter.  NOTE: this was
originally reported as remote file inclusion, but this may be
inaccurate.
