LibTIFF in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3 on x86_64 platforms, as
used in tiff2rgba, attempts to process image data even when the
required compression functionality is not configured, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted TIFF
image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."
