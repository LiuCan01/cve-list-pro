Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Document Capture component in
Oracle Fusion Middleware 10.1.3.4 and 10.1.3.5 allows remote attackers
to affect integrity and availability via unknown vectors related to
Import Server.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
January 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from the
original researcher that remote attackers can overwrite arbitrary
files and execute arbitrary code via a full pathname in the first
argument to the WriteJPG method in the NCSECWLib ActiveX control.
