Opera before 10.63 does not properly restrict web script in
unspecified circumstances involving reloads and redirects, which
allows remote attackers to spoof the Address Bar, conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks, and possibly execute arbitrary code by
leveraging the ability of a script to interact with a web page from
(1) a different domain or (2) a different security context.
