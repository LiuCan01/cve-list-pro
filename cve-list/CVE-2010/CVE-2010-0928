OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx
Virtex-II Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm
for certain signature calculations, and does not verify the signature
before providing it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically
proximate attackers to determine the private key via a modified supply
voltage for the microprocessor, related to a "fault-based attack."
