Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in CoreTypes in Apple Mac OS X
before 10.6.3 makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to
execute arbitrary JavaScript via a web page that offers a download
with a Content-Type value that is not on the list of possibly unsafe
content types for Safari, as demonstrated by the values for the (1)
.ibplugin and (2) .url extensions.
