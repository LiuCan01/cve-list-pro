The Mobile Network Connections functionality in the Connection Manager
in IBM Lotus Mobile Connect before 6.1.4, when HTTP Access Services
(HTTP-AS) is enabled, does not properly handle failed attempts at
establishing HTTP-TCP sessions, which allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (memory consumption and daemon crash) by making
many TCP connection attempts.
