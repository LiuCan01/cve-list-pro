Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0 on
Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, Safari before 4.1 on Mac OS X
10.4, and Safari on Apple iPhone OS allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash), or
read the SMS database or other data, via vectors related to "attribute
manipulation," as demonstrated by Vincenzo Iozzo and Ralf Philipp
Weinmann during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2010.
