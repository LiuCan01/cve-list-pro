Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) 7.3 and 8 and Dogtag Certificate
System do not require authentication for requests to decrypt SCEP
one-time PINs, which allows remote attackers to obtain PINs by
sniffing the network for SCEP requests and then sending decryption
requests to the Certificate Authority component.
