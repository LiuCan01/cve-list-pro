Reference: CISCO:20101129 Cisco IPSec VPN Implementation Group Name Enumeration Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_response09186a0080b5992c.html

The remote-access IPSec VPN implementation on Cisco Adaptive Security
Appliances (ASA) 5500 series devices, PIX Security Appliances 500
series devices, and VPN Concentrators 3000 series devices responds to
an Aggressive Mode IKE Phase I message only when the group name is
configured on the device, which allows remote attackers to enumerate
valid group names via a series of IKE negotiation attempts, aka Bug ID
CSCtj96108, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2025.
