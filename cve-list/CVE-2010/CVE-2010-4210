The pfs_getextattr function in FreeBSD 7.x before 7.3-RELEASE and 8.x
before 8.0-RC1 unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, which
allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic),
overwrite arbitrary memory locations, and possibly execute arbitrary
code via vectors related to opening a file on a file system that uses
pseudofs.
