The hfs implementation in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.x before
10.6.5 supports hard links to directories and does not prevent certain
deeply nested directory structures, which allows local users to cause
a denial of service (filesystem corruption) via a crafted application
that calls the mkdir and link functions, related to the fsck_hfs
program in the diskdev_cmds component.
