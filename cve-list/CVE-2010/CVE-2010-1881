The FieldList ActiveX control in the Microsoft Access Wizard Controls
in ACCWIZ.dll in Microsoft Office Access 2003 SP3 does not properly
interact with the memory-access approach used by Internet Explorer and
Office during instantiation, which allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via an
HTML document that references this control along with crafted
persistent storage data, aka "ACCWIZ.dll Uninitialized Variable
Vulnerability."
