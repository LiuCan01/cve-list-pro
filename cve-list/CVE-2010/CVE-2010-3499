Reference: BUGTRAQ:20101018 Antivirus detection after malware execution
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/514356
Reference: MISC:http://www.n00bz.net/antivirus-cve

F-Secure Anti-Virus does not properly interact with the processing of
hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malware that
is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection approach
that occurs too late to stop the code execution.  NOTE: the researcher
indicates that a vendor response was received, stating that "the
inability to catch these files are caused by lacking functionality
rather than programming errors."
