Apache MyFaces 1.1.7 and 1.2.8, as used in IBM WebSphere Application
Server and other applications, does not properly handle an unencrypted
view state, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary Expression Language (EL)
statements via vectors that involve modifying the serialized view
object.
