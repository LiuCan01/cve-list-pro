The kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP3 do not properly
perform indexing of a function-pointer table during the loading of
keyboard layouts from disk, which allows local users to gain
privileges via a crafted application, as demonstrated in the wild in
July 2010 by the Stuxnet worm, aka "Win32k Keyboard Layout
Vulnerability."  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2010-3888 or
CVE-2010-3889.
