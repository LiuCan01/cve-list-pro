IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.0.0.x before
6.0.0.8-TIV-ITDS-IF0007 does not properly handle invalid buffer
references in LDAP BER requests, which might allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via vectors involving a
buffer that has a memory address near the maximum possible address.
