Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 8 does not properly handle
objects in memory in certain circumstances involving use of Microsoft
Word to read Word documents, which allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by accessing an object that (1) was not properly
initialized or (2) is deleted, leading to memory corruption, aka
"Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
