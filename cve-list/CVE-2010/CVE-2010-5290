The authentication process in Adobe ColdFusion before 10 does not
require knowledge of the cleartext password if the password hash is
known, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain
administrative privileges by leveraging read access to the
configuration file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2861.
