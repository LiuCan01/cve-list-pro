The jumpUrl (aka access tracking) implementation in
tslib/class.tslib_fe.php in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.15, 4.3.x before
4.3.7, and 4.4.x before 4.4.4 does not properly compare certain hash
values during access-control decisions, which allows remote attackers
to read arbitrary files via unspecified vectors.
