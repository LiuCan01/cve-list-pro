The Clipboard::DispatchObject function in app/clipboard/clipboard.cc
in Google Chrome before 5.0.375.70 does not properly handle
CBF_SMBITMAP objects in a ViewHostMsg_ClipboardWriteObjectsAsync
message, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via vectors involving crafted data from the renderer process, related
to a "Type Confusion" issue.
