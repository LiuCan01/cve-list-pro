The JavaScript implementation in Apple Safari 4 does not properly
restrict the set of values contained in the object returned by the
getComputedStyle method, which allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information about visited web pages by calling this method,
a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2264.  NOTE: this may overlap
CVE-2010-5073.
