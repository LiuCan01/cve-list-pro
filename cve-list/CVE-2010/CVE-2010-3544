Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle iPlanet Web Server (Sun Java
System Web Server) component in Oracle Sun Products Suite 7.0 allows
remote attackers to affect integrity and availability via unknown
vectors related to Administration.  NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on
claims from a reliable source that this is cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) that allows remote attackers to stop an instance via the
management console.
