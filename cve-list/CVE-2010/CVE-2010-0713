Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Zenoss
2.3.3, and other versions before 2.5, allow remote attackers to hijack
the authentication of an administrator for (1) requests that reset
user passwords via zport/dmd/ZenUsers/admin, and (2) requests that
change user commands, which allows for remote execution of system
commands via zport/dmd/userCommands/.
