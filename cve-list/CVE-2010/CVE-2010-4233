The Linux installation on the Camtron CMNC-200 Full HD IP Camera and
TecVoz CMNC-200 Megapixel IP Camera with firmware 1.102A-008 has a
default password of m for the root account, and a default password of
merlin for the mg3500 account, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain access via the TELNET interface.
