Unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component in Oracle Java
SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.
Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that
this is related to "how Web Start retrieves security policies,"
BasicServiceImpl, and forged policies that bypass sandbox
restrictions.
