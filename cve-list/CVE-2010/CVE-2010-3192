Certain run-time memory protection mechanisms in the GNU C Library
(aka glibc or libc6) print argv[0] and backtrace information, which
might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive
information from process memory by executing an incorrect program, as
demonstrated by a setuid program that contains a stack-based buffer
overflow error, related to the __fortify_fail function in
debug/fortify_fail.c, and the __stack_chk_fail (aka stack protection)
and __chk_fail (aka FORTIFY_SOURCE) implementations.
