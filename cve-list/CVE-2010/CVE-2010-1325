Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the apache2-slms
package in SUSE Lifecycle Management Server (SLMS) 1.0 on SUSE Linux
Enterprise (SLE) 11 allows remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of unspecified victims via vectors related to improper
parameter quoting.  NOTE: some sources report that this is a
vulnerability in a product named "Apache SLMS," but that is incorrect.
