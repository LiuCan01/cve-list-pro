The privilege-dropping implementation in the (1) pam_env and (2)
pam_mail modules in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 does not perform the
required setfsgid and setgroups system calls, which might allow local
users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging unintended group
permissions, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on the
.pam_environment file in a user's home directory.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-3435.
