HTTP authentication implementation in Geo++ GNCASTER 1.4.0.7 and
earlier allows remote attackers to read authentication headers of
other users via a large request with an incorrect authentication
attempt, which includes sensitive memory in the response.  NOTE: this
is referred to as a "memory leak" by some sources, but is better
characterized as "memory disclosure."
