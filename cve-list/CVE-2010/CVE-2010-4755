The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put
function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3
and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory
consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any
pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT
requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2010-2632.
