Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Data Access Objects (DAO)
library (dao360.dll) in Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3, Windows
Server 2003 R2 Enterprise Edition SP3, Windows Vista Business SP1, and
Windows 7 Professional allows local users, and possibly remote
attackers, to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks
via a Trojan horse msjet49.dll that is located in the same folder as a
file that is processed by dao360.dll.  NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
