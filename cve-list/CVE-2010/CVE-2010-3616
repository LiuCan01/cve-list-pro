ISC DHCP server 4.2 before 4.2.0-P2, when configured to use failover
partnerships, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(communications-interrupted state and DHCP client service loss) by
connecting to a port that is only intended for a failover peer, as
demonstrated by a Nagios check_tcp process check to TCP port 520.
