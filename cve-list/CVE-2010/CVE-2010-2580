The SMTP service (MESMTPC.exe) in MailEnable 3.x and 4.25 does not
properly perform a length check, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a long (1) email address in the
MAIL FROM command, or (2) domain name in the RCPT TO command, which
triggers an "unhandled invalid parameter error."
