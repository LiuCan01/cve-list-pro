Mozilla Firefox 3.6.3 on Windows XP SP3 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via JavaScript code that
performs certain string concatenation and substring operations, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2009-1571.
