hald in Sun OpenSolaris snv_51 through snv_130 does not have the
proc_audit privilege during unspecified attempts to write to the
auditing log, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers
to avoid detection of changes to the set of connected hardware devices
supporting the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) specification.
