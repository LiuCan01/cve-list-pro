The ParamTraits<SkBitmap>::Read function in
common/common_param_traits.cc in Google Chrome before 4.0.249.78 does
not initialize the memory locations that will hold bitmap data, which
might allow remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive
information from process memory by providing insufficient data,
related to use of a (1) thumbnail database or (2) HTML canvas.
