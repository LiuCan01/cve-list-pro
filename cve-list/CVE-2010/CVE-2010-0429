libspice, as used in QEMU-KVM in the Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor)
in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2 and qspice 0.3.0, does
not properly restrict the addresses upon which memory-management
actions are performed, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial
of service (guest OS crash) or possibly gain privileges via
unspecified vectors.
