The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (CPU consumption and system hang) by sending many Router
Advertisement (RA) messages with different source addresses, as
demonstrated by the flood_router6 program in the thc-ipv6 package.
