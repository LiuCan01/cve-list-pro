The user interface in Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS) in Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2 does not properly set administrative-share
permissions for new cluster disks that are shared as part of a
failover cluster, which allows remote attackers to read or modify data
on these disks via requests to the associated share, aka "Permissions
on New Cluster Disks Vulnerability."
