The bcm_connect function in net/can/bcm.c (aka the Broadcast Manager)
in the Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux
kernel 2.6.36 and earlier creates a publicly accessible file with a
filename containing a kernel memory address, which allows local users
to obtain potentially sensitive information about kernel memory use by
listing this filename.
