Mahara before 1.0.15, 1.1.x before 1.1.9, and 1.2.x before 1.2.5 has
improper configuration options for authentication plugins associated
with logins that use the single sign-on (SSO) functionality, which
allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an empty
password.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
