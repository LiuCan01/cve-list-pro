The CTimeoutEventList::InsertIntoTimeoutList function in Microsoft
mshtml.dll uses a certain pointer value as part of producing Timer ID
values for the setTimeout and setInterval methods in VBScript and
JScript, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
about the heap memory addresses used by an application, as
demonstrated by the Internet Explorer 8 application.
