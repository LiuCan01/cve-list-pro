The processcompl_compat function in drivers/usb/core/devio.c in Linux
kernel 2.6.x through 2.6.32, and possibly other versions, does not
clear the transfer buffer before returning to userspace when a USB
command fails, which might make it easier for physically proximate
attackers to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory).
