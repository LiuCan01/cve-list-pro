The Pickle::Pickle function in base/pickle.cc in Google Chrome before
8.0.552.224 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.343 on 64-bit Linux platforms
does not properly perform pointer arithmetic, which allows remote
attackers to bypass message deserialization validation, and cause a
denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact, via
invalid pickle data.
