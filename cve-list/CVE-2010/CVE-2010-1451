The TSB I-TLB load implementation in arch/sparc/kernel/tsb.S in the
Linux kernel before 2.6.33 on the SPARC platform does not properly
obtain the value of a certain _PAGE_EXEC_4U bit and consequently does
not properly implement a non-executable stack, which makes it easier
for context-dependent attackers to exploit stack-based buffer
overflows via a crafted application.
