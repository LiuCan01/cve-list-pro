mod_proxy in httpd in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.9, when running on Unix,
does not close the backend connection if a timeout occurs when reading
a response from a persistent connection, which allows remote attackers
to obtain a potentially sensitive response intended for a different
client in opportunistic circumstances via a normal HTTP request.  NOTE:
this is the same issue as CVE-2010-2068, but for a different OS and
set of affected versions.
