Directory traversal vulnerability in the Community Builder Enhanced
(CBE) (com_cbe) component 1.4.8, 1.4.9, and 1.4.10 for Joomla! allows
remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a ..
(dot dot) in the tabname parameter in a userProfile action to
index.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code by
using the file upload feature.
