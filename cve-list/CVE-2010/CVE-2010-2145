Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ClearSite Beta
4.50, and possibly other versions, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the cs_base_path parameter to (1)
docs.php and (2) include/admin/device_admin.php.  NOTE: the header.php
vector is already covered by CVE-2009-3306.  NOTE: this issue may be
due to a variable extraction error.
