Google Chrome before 4.0.249.78 on Windows does not perform the
expected encoding, escaping, and quoting for the URL in the --app
argument in a desktop shortcut, which allows user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary programs or obtain sensitive
information by tricking a user into creating a crafted shortcut.
