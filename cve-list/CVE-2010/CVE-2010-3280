The CCAgent option 9.0.8.4 and earlier in the management server (aka
TSA) component in Alcatel-Lucent OmniTouch Contact Center Standard
Edition relies on client-side authorization checking, and
unconditionally sends the SuperUser password to the client for use
during an authorized session, which allows remote attackers to monitor
or reconfigure Contact Center operations via a modified client
application.
