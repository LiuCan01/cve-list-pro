** DISPUTED **

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard)
before 1.6.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
via the keywords parameter in a (1) do_search action to search.php or
(2) do_stuff action to private.php.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this
issue, saying "Although this doesn't lead to an SQL injection, it does
provide a general MyBB SQL error."
