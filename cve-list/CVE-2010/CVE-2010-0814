The Microsoft Access Wizard Controls in ACCWIZ.dll in Microsoft Office
Access 2003 SP3 and 2007 SP1 and SP2 do not properly interact with the
memory-allocation approach used by Internet Explorer during
instantiation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a web site that references multiple ActiveX controls, as
demonstrated by the ImexGrid and FieldList controls, aka "Access
ActiveX Control Vulnerability."
