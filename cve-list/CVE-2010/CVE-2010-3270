Stack-based buffer overflow in Cisco WebEx Meeting Center T27LB before
SP21 EP3 and T27LC before SP22 allows user-assisted remote
authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted
.atp file and then disconnecting from a meeting.  NOTE: since this is a
site-specific issue with no expected action for consumers, it might be
REJECTed.
