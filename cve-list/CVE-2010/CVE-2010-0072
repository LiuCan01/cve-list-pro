Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Secure Backup component in
Oracle Secure Backup 10.2.0.3 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2010 CPU.
Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that
this is a buffer overflow in observiced.exe that allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to a "reverse
lookup of connections" to TCP port 10000.
