solid.exe in IBM solidDB 6.5.0.3 and earlier does not properly perform
a recursive call to a certain function upon receiving packet data
containing many integer fields with two different values, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access
and daemon crash) via a TCP session on port 1315.
