The pam_sm_close_session function in pam_xauth.c in the pam_xauth
module in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 and earlier does not properly
handle a failure to determine a certain target uid, which might allow
local users to delete unintended files by executing a program that
relies on the pam_xauth PAM check.
