The asyncore module in Python before 3.2 does not properly handle
unsuccessful calls to the accept function, and does not have
accompanying documentation describing how daemon applications should
handle unsuccessful calls to the accept function, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks that
terminate these applications via network connections.
