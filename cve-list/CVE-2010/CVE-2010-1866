The dechunk filter in PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2, when decoding an HTTP
chunked encoding stream, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption via a
negative chunk size, which bypasses a signed comparison, related to an
integer overflow in the chunk size decoder.
