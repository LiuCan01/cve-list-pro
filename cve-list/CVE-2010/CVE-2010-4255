The fixup_page_fault function in arch/x86/traps.c in Xen 4.0.1 and
earlier on 64-bit platforms, when paravirtualization is enabled, does
not verify that kernel mode is used to call the
handle_gdt_ldt_mapping_fault function, which allows guest OS users to
cause a denial of service (host OS BUG_ON) via a crafted memory
access.
