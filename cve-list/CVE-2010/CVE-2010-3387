** DISPUTED **

vdrleaktest in Video Disk Recorder (VDR) 1.6.0 places a zero-length
directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to
gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the current
working directory.  NOTE: a third party disputes this issue because the
script erroneously uses a semicolon in a context where a colon was
intended.
