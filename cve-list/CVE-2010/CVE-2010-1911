The site-locking implementation in the SdcWebSecureBase interface in
tgctlcm.dll in Consona Live Assistance, Dynamic Agent, and Subscriber
Assistance relies on a list of server domain names to restrict
execution of ActiveX controls, which makes it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a DNS
hijacking attack.
