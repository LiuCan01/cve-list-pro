Unspecified vulnerability in the FTP Server in Oracle Solaris 8, 9,
10, and 11 Express allows remote attackers to affect
availability. NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
January 2011 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
researcher that this is an issue in the glob implementation in libc
that allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
(CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not
match any pathnames.
