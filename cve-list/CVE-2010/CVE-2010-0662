The ParamTraits<SkBitmap>::Read function in
common/common_param_traits.cc in Google Chrome before 4.0.249.78 does
not use the correct variables in calculations designed to prevent
integer overflows, which allows attackers to leverage renderer access
to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
via bitmap data, related to deserialization.
