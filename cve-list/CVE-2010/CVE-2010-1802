libsecurity in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.4 does not properly
perform comparisons to domain-name strings in X.509 certificates,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a
certificate associated with a similar domain name, as demonstrated by
use of a www.example.con certificate to spoof www.example.com.
