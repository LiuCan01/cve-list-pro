The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in Cisco IOS before 15.0(1)XA5 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (CPU consumption and device hang) by sending many
Router Advertisement (RA) messages with different source addresses, as
demonstrated by the flood_router6 program in the thc-ipv6 package, aka
Bug ID CSCti33534.
