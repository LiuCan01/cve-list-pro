The dynamic configuration feature in Xinha WYSIWYG editor 0.96 Beta 2
and earlier, as used in Serendipity 1.5.2 and earlier, allows remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and modify the
configuration of arbitrary plugins via (1) crafted
backend_config_secret_key_location and backend_config_hash parameters
that are used in a SHA1 hash of a shared secret that can be known or
externally influenced, which are not properly handled by the
"Deprecated config passing" feature; or (2) crafted backend_data and
backend_data[key_location] variables, which are not properly handled
by the xinha_read_passed_data function.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to
upload and possibly execute arbitrary files via config.inc.php in the
ImageManager plugin.
