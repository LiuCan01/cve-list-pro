Install/Filesystem.pm in Bugzilla 3.5.1 through 3.6.1 and 3.7 through
3.7.1, when use_suexec is enabled, uses world-readable permissions
within (1) .bzr/ and (2) data/webdot/, which allows local users to
obtain potentially sensitive data by reading files in these
directories, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0180.
