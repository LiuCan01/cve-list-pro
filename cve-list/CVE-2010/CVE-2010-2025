Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the web
interface on the Cisco Scientific Atlanta WebSTAR DPC2100R2 cable

the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) reset the
modem, (2) erase the firmware, (3) change the administrative password,
(4) install modified firmware, or (5) change the access level, as
demonstrated by a request to goform/_aslvl.
