The auto-complete functionality in the Chaos Tool Suite (aka CTools)
module 6.x before 6.x-1.4 for Drupal does not follow access
restrictions, which allows remote authenticated users, with "access
content" privileges, to read the title of an unpublished node via a
q=ctools/autocomplete/node/ value accompanied by the first character
of the node's title.
