Directory traversal vulnerability in
plugins/system/cdscriptegrator/libraries/highslide/js/jsloader.php in
the Core Design Scriptegrator plugin 1.4.1 for Joomla! allows remote
attackers to read, and possibly include and execute, arbitrary files
via directory traversal sequences in the files[] parameter, a
different vector than CVE-2010-0760.
