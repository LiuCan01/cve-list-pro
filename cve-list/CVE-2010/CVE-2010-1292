The implementation of pami RIFF chunk parsing in Adobe Shockwave
Player before 11.5.7.609 does not validate a certain value from a file
before using it in file-pointer calculations, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) via a crafted .dir (aka Director) file.
