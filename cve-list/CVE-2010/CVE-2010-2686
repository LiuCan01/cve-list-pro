Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in clientes.asp in the TopManage
OLK module 1.91.30 for SAP allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
SQL commands via the (1) PriceFrom, (2) PriceTo, and (3) InvFrom
parameters, as reachable from olk/c_p/searchCart.asp, and other
unspecified vectors when performing an advanced search.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
