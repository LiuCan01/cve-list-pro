RSA Authentication Client 2.0.x, 3.0, and 3.5.x before 3.5.3 does not
properly handle a SENSITIVE or NON-EXTRACTABLE tag on a secret key
object that is stored on a SecurID 800 authenticator, which allows
local users to bypass intended access restrictions and read keys via
unspecified PKCS#11 API requests.
