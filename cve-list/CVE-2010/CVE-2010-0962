The FTP proxy server in Apple AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and
Time Capsule with firmware 7.5 does not restrict the IP address and
port specified in a PORT command from a client, which allows remote
attackers to leverage intranet FTP servers for arbitrary TCP
forwarding via a crafted PORT command.
