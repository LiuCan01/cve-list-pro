lib/fsm.c in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly reset the
metadata of an executable file during replacement of the file in an
RPM package upgrade or deletion of the file in an RPM package removal,
which might allow local users to bypass intended access restrictions
by creating a hard link to a vulnerable file that has a POSIX ACL, a
related issue to CVE-2010-2059.
