WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.3 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and
Windows, and before 4.1.3 on Mac OS X 10.4, does not properly perform
a cast of an unspecified variable during processing of Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) 3D transforms, which allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a
crafted web site.
