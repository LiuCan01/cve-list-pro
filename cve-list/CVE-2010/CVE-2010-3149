Untrusted search path vulnerability in Adobe Device Central CS5
3.0.0(376), 3.0.1.0 (3027), and probably other versions allows local
users, and possibly remote attackers, to execute arbitrary code and
conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse qtcf.dll that is
located in the same folder as an ADCP file.
