GE Healthcare Optima MR360 does not require authentication for the
HIPAA emergency login procedure, which allows physically proximate
users to gain access via an arbitrary username in the Emergency Login
screen.  NOTE: this might not qualify for inclusion in CVE if
unauthenticated emergency access is part of the intended security
policy of the product, can be controlled by the system administrator,
and is not enabled by default.
