Unspecified vulnerability in the Audit Vault component in Oracle Audit
Vault 10.2.3.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous
information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not
commented on claims from a reliable third party coordinator that this
issue is related to a crafted parameter in an action.execute request
to the av component on TCP port 5700.
