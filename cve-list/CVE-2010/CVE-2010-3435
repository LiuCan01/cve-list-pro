The (1) pam_env and (2) pam_mail modules in Linux-PAM (aka pam) before
1.1.2 use root privileges during read access to files and directories
that belong to arbitrary user accounts, which might allow local users
to obtain sensitive information by leveraging this filesystem
activity, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on the .pam_environment
file in a user's home directory.
