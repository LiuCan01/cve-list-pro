The x86 emulator in KVM 83, when a guest is configured for Symmetric
Multiprocessing (SMP), does not use the Current Privilege Level (CPL)
and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL) to restrict instruction execution,
which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS
crash) or gain privileges on the guest OS by leveraging access to a
(1) IO port or (2) MMIO region, and replacing an instruction in
between emulator entry and instruction fetch, a related issue to
CVE-2010-0298.
