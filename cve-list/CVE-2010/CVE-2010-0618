The flood-protection feature in the base, IPDS DLE, Forms DLE, Barcode
DLE, Prescribe DLE, and Printcryption DLE components on certain
Lexmark laser and inkjet printers and MarkNet devices allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (TCP outage) by making many
passive FTP connections and then aborting these connections.
