Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/64963

The iconv_mime_decode_headers function in the Iconv extension in PHP
before 5.3.4 does not properly handle encodings that are unrecognized
by the iconv and mbstring (aka Multibyte String) implementations,
which allows remote attackers to trigger an incomplete output array,
and possibly bypass spam detection or have unspecified other impact,
via a crafted Subject header in an e-mail message, as demonstrated by
the ks_c_5601-1987 character set.
