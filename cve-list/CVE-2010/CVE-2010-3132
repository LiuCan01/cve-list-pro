Untrusted search path vulnerability in Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 11.0

users, and possibly remote attackers, to execute arbitrary code and
conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse (1) mfc90loc.dll or
(2) dwmapi.dll that is located in the same folder as a CSS, PHP, ASP,
or other file that automatically launches Dreamweaver.
