Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle Java SE and
Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28
allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and
availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on
claims from a reliable researcher that this involves an incorrect sign
extension in the HeadspaceSoundbank.nGetName function, which allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted BANK record that
leads to a buffer overflow.
