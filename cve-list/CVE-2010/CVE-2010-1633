RSA verification recovery in the EVP_PKEY_verify_recover function in
OpenSSL 1.x before 1.0.0a, as used by pkeyutl and possibly other
applications, returns uninitialized memory upon failure, which might
allow context-dependent attackers to bypass intended key requirements
or obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.
