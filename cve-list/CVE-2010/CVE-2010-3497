Reference: BUGTRAQ:20101018 Antivirus detection after malware execution
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/514356
Reference: MISC:http://www.n00bz.net/antivirus-cve

Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2011 does not properly interact with the
processing of hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a
detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution.
NOTE: the researcher indicates that a vendor response was received,
stating that this issue "falls into the work of our Firewall and not
our AV (per our methodology of layers of defense)."
