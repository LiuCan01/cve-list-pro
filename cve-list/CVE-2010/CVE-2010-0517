Heap-based buffer overflow in QuickTime in Apple Mac OS X before
10.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service (application crash) via a crafted movie file with
M-JPEG encoding, which causes QuickTime to calculate a buffer size
using height and width fields, but to use a different field to control
the length of a copy operation.
