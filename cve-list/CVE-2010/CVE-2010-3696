The fr_dhcp_decode function in lib/dhcp.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.9, in
certain non-default builds, does not properly handle the DHCP Relay
Agent Information option, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (infinite loop and daemon outage) via a packet that
has more than one sub-option.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained
from third party information.
