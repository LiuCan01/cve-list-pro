Untrusted search path vulnerability in Nullsoft Winamp 5.581, and
probably other versions, allows local users, and possibly remote
attackers, to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks
via a Trojan horse wnaspi32.dll that is located in the same folder as
a .669, .aac, .aiff, .amf, .au, .avr, .b4s, .caf or .cda file.
