Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 does not properly handle
objects in memory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code by accessing an object that (1) was not properly initialized or
(2) is deleted, leading to memory corruption, aka "Uninitialized
Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
