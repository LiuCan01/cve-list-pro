Sun Java System Web Server (aka SJWS) 7.0 Update 7 allows remote
attackers to overwrite memory locations in the heap, and discover the
contents of memory locations, via a malformed HTTP TRACE request that
includes a long URI and many empty headers, related to an "overflow."
NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2010-0272 and CVE-2010-0273.
