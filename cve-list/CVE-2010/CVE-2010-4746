Multiple memory leaks in the normalization functionality in 389
Directory Server before 1.2.7.5 allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via "badly behaved
applications," related to (1) Slapi_Attr mishandling in the DN
normalization code and (2) pointer mishandling in the syntax
normalization code, a different issue than CVE-2011-0019.
