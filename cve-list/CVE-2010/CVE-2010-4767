Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.6 does not properly
handle e-mail messages in which the From line contains UTF-8
characters associated with diacritical marks and an invalid charset,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (duplicate
tickets and duplicate auto-responses) by sending a crafted message to
a POP3 mailbox.
