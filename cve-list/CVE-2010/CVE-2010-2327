mod_ibm_ssl in IBM HTTP Server 6.0 before 6.0.2.43, 6.1 before
6.1.0.33, and 7.0 before 7.0.0.11, as used in IBM WebSphere
Application Server (WAS) on z/OS, does not properly handle a large
HTTP request body in uploading over SSL, which might allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon fail) via an upload.
