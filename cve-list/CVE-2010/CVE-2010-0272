Heap-based buffer overflow in Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 Update 6
on Linux allows remote attackers to discover process memory locations
via crafted data to TCP port 80, as demonstrated by the vd_sjws2
module in VulnDisco.  NOTE: as of 20100106, this disclosure has no
actionable information. However, because the VulnDisco author is a
reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for
tracking purposes.
