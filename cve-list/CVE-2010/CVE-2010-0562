The sdump function in sdump.c in fetchmail 6.3.11, 6.3.12, and 6.3.13,
when running in verbose mode on platforms for which char is signed,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an SSL X.509 certificate
containing non-printable characters with the high bit set, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow during escaping.
