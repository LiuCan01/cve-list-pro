Integer overflow in the OBGIOPServerWorker::extractHeader function in
the ebus-3-3-2-6.dll module in SAP Crystal Reports 2008 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a GIOP packet with a crafted size, which triggers a
heap-based buffer overflow.
