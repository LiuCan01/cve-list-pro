Reference: CONFIRM:http://www.infradead.org/openconnect.html

OpenConnect before 2.25 does not properly validate X.509 certificates,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary AnyConnect
SSL VPN servers via a crafted server certificate that (1) does not
correspond to the server hostname or (2) is presented in circumstances
involving a missing --cafile configuration option.
