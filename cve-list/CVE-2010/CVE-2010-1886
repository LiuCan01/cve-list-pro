Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows
Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2, and Windows 7 allow
local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a process with
NetworkService credentials, as demonstrated by TAPI Server, SQL
Server, and IIS processes, and related to the Windows Service
Isolation feature.  NOTE: the vendor states that privilege escalation
from NetworkService to LocalSystem does not cross a "security
boundary."
