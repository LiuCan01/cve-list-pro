The Word 97 text converter in the WordPad Text Converters in Microsoft
Windows XP SP2 and SP3 and Server 2003 SP2 does not properly parse
malformed structures in Word 97 documents, which allows remote

an unspecified value that is used in a loop counter, aka "WordPad Word
97 Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
