Heap-based buffer overflow in DirectShow in Microsoft DirectX, as used
in the AVI Filter on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP2 and SP3, and
Windows Server 2003 SP2, and in Quartz on Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP
SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista Gold, SP1, and
SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold, SP2, and R2, and Windows 7, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an AVI file with a
crafted length field in an unspecified video stream, which is not
properly handled by the RLE video decompressor, aka "DirectShow Heap
Overflow Vulnerability."
