Stack-based buffer overflow in MicroP 0.1.1.1600 allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .mppl file.  NOTE: it
has been reported that the overflow is in the lpFileName parameter of
the CreateFileA function, but the overflow is probably caused by a
separate, unnamed function.
