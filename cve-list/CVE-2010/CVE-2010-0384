Reference: MLIST:[or-talk] 20100120 Tor 0.2.2.7-alpha is out
Reference: URL:http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00162.html

Tor 0.2.2.x before 0.2.2.7-alpha, when functioning as a directory
mirror, does not prevent logging of the client IP address upon
detection of erroneous client behavior, which might make it easier for
local users to discover the identities of clients in opportunistic
circumstances by reading log files.
