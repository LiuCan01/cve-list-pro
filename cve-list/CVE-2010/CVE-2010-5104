The escapeStrForLike method in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.16, 4.3.x before
4.3.9, and 4.4.x before 4.4.5 does not properly escape input when the
MySQL database is set to sql_mode NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES, which allows
remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via wildcard
characters in a LIKE query.
