The on-demand scanning in Symantec AntiVirus 10.0.x and 10.1.x before
MR9, AntiVirus 10.2.x, and Client Security 3.0.x and 3.1.x before MR9,
when Tamper protection is disabled, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (prevention of on-demand scanning) via "specific
events" that prevent the user from having read access to unspecified
resources.
