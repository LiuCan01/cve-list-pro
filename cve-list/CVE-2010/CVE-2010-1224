main/acl.c in Asterisk Open Source 1.6.0.x before 1.6.0.25, 1.6.1.x
before 1.6.1.17, and 1.6.2.x before 1.6.2.5 does not properly enforce
remote host access controls when CIDR notation "/0" is used in permit=
and deny= configuration rules, which causes an improper arithmetic
shift and might allow remote attackers to bypass ACL rules and access
services from unauthorized hosts.
