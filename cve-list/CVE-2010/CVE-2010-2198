lib/fsm.c in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly reset the
metadata of an executable file during replacement of the file in an
RPM package upgrade or deletion of the file in an RPM package removal,
which might allow local users to gain privileges or bypass intended
access restrictions by creating a hard link to a vulnerable file that
has (1) POSIX file capabilities or (2) SELinux context information, a
related issue to CVE-2010-2059.
