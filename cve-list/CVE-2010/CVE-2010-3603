Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the file manager
service (Services/FileService.ashx) in mojoPortal 2.3.4.3 and 2.3.5.1
allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators
for requests that rename arbitrary files, as demonstrated by causing
the user.config file to be moved, leading to a denial of service
(service stop) and possibly the exposure of sensitive information.
