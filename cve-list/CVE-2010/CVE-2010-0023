The Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) in Microsoft Windows 2000
SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP2 does not properly kill
processes after a logout, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
information or gain privileges via a crafted application that
continues to execute throughout the logout of one user and the login
session of the next user, aka "CSRSS Local Privilege Elevation
Vulnerability."
