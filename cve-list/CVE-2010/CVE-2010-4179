The installation documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Messaging,
Realtime and Grid (MRG) 1.3 recommends that Condor should be
configured so that the MRG Management Console (cumin) can submit jobs
for users, which creates a trusted channel with insufficient access
control that allows local users with the ability to publish to a
broker to run jobs as arbitrary users via Condor QMF plug-ins.
