McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.5i and 8.7i does not properly interact
with the processing of hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support
Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product,
but with a detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code
execution.
