FastBackMount.exe in the Mount service in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager
(TSM) FastBack 5.5.0.0 through 5.5.6.0 and 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.1
does not properly handle a certain failure to allocate memory, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and daemon crash, and recovery failure) by specifying a
large size value within TCP packet data.  NOTE: this might overlap
CVE-2010-3061.
