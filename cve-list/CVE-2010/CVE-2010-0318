The replay functionality for ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) in FreeBSD 7.1, 7.2,
and 8.0, when creating files during replay of a setattr transaction,
uses 7777 permissions instead of the original permissions, which might
allow local users to read or modify unauthorized files in
opportunistic circumstances after a system crash or power failure.
