pubconv.dll (aka the Publisher Converter DLL) in Microsoft Publisher
2002 SP3, 2003 SP3, and 2007 SP2 does not properly handle an
unspecified size field in certain older file formats, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service (heap memory corruption) via a crafted Publisher file, aka
"Size Value Heap Corruption in pubconv.dll Vulnerability."
