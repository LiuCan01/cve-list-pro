Reference: XF:php-setmagicquotesruntime-sql-injection(64964)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/64964

The set_magic_quotes_runtime function in PHP 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, when the
MySQLi extension is used, does not properly interact with use of the
mysqli_fetch_assoc function, which might make it easier for
context-dependent attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via
crafted input that had been properly handled in earlier PHP versions.
