Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in DATAC RealWin 2.0 Build
6.1.8.10 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long (1)
SCPC_INITIALIZE, (2) SCPC_INITIALIZE_RF, or (3) SCPC_TXTEVENT packet.
NOTE: it was later reported that 1.06 is also affected by one of these
requests.
