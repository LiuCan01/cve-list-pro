MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) before 1.4.12 does not properly restrict
uid values for group join requests, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by using guest access
to submit join request forms for moderated groups, related to
usercp.php and managegroup.php.
