The SdcUser.TgConCtl ActiveX control in tgctlcm.dll in Consona Live
Assistance, Dynamic Agent, and Subscriber Assistance does not properly
restrict access to the HTTPDownloadFile, HTTPGetFile, Install, and
RunCmd methods, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
programs via a URL in the url argument to (1) HTTPDownloadFile or (2)
HTTPGetFile.
