The Limit Mail feature in the Parental Controls functionality in Mail
on Apple Mac OS X does not properly enforce the correspondence
whitelist, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and conduct e-mail communication by leveraging knowledge
of a child's e-mail address and a parent's e-mail address, related to
parental notification of unapproved e-mail addresses.
