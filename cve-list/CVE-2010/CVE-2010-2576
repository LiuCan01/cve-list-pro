Opera before 10.61 does not properly suppress clicks on download
dialogs that became visible after a recent tab change, which allows
remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks, and consequently
execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving (1) closing a tab or (2)
hiding a tab, a related issue to CVE-2005-2407.
