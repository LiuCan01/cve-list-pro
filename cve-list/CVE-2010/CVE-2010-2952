Apache Traffic Server before 2.0.1, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2-unstable,
does not properly choose DNS source ports and transaction IDs, and
does not properly use DNS query fields to validate responses, which
makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to poison the internal
DNS cache via a crafted response.
