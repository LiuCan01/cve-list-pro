The IBM BladeCenter with Advanced Management Module (AMM) firmware
build ID BPET48L, and possibly other versions before 4.7 and 5.0,
stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient
access control, which allows remote attackers to download (1) logs or
(2) core files via direct requests, as demonstrated by a request for
private/sdc.tgz.
