Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the HP 3Com OfficeConnect
Gigabit VPN Firewall 3CREVF100-73 with firmware before 1.0.13 allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: a separate XSS issue for HP System
Management Homepage (SMH) was originally assigned CVE-2010-3010 due to
a CNA error, but CVE-2010-3012 is the appropriate identifier for the
SMH issue.
