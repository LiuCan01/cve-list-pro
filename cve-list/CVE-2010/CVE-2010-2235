template_api.py in Cobbler before 2.0.7, as used in Red Hat Network
Satellite Server and other products, does not disable the ability of
the Cheetah template engine to execute Python statements contained in
templates, which allows remote authenticated administrators to execute
arbitrary code via a crafted kickstart template file, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2008-6954.
