Novell Netware 6.5 SP8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference, memory consumption, ABEND, and
crash) via a large number of malformed or AFP requests that are not
properly handled by (1) the CIFS functionality in CIFS.nlm Semantic
Agent (Build 163 MP) 3.27 or (2) the AFP functionality in AFPTCP.nlm
Build 163 SP 3.27.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
