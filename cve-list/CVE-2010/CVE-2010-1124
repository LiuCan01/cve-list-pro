bos.rte.libc 5.3.9.4 on IBM AIX 5.3 does not properly support reading
a certain address field after a successful getaddrinfo function call,
which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by IBM
DB2 crashes on "systems with databases cataloged with alternate
servers using IP addresses."
