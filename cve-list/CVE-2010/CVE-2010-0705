Aavmker4.sys in avast! 4.8 through 4.8.1368.0 and 5.0 before 5.0.418.0
running on Windows 2000 and XP does not properly validate input to
IOCTL 0xb2d60030, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code to gain privileges
via IOCTL requests using crafted kernel addresses that trigger memory
corruption.
