Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in
WebCalendar 1.2.0, and other versions before 1.2.5, allow remote
attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests
that (1) delete an event or (2) ban an IP address from posting via
unknown vectors.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
