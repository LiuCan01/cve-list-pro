Unspecified vulnerability in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.8.612
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors
that trigger memory corruption.  NOTE: due to conflicting information
and use of the same CVE identifier by the vendor, ZDI, and
TippingPoint, it is not clear whether this issue is related to use of
an uninitialized pointer, an incorrect pointer offset calculation, or
both.
