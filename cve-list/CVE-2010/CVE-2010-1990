Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x, 3.5.x, 3.0.19, and earlier, and SeaMonkey,
executes a mail application in situations where an IFRAME element has
a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (excessive application launches) via an HTML
document with many IFRAME elements.
