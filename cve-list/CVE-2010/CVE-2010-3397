Untrusted search path vulnerability in PGP Desktop 9.9.0 Build 397,
9.10.x, 10.0.0 Build 2732, and probably other versions allows local
users, and possibly remote attackers, to execute arbitrary code and
conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse tsp.dll or tvttsp.dll
that is located in the same folder as a .p12, .pem, .pgp, .prk,
.prvkr, .pubkr, .rnd, or .skr file.
