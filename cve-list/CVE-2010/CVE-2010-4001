** DISPUTED ** GMXRC.bash in Gromacs 4.5.1 and earlier places a
zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local
users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the
current working directory.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the
GMXLDLIB value is always added to the beginning of LD_LIBRARY_PATH at
a later point in the script.
