Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 does not initialize certain data
structures during execution of the createElement method, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and application crash) via crafted JavaScript code, as
demonstrated by setting the (1) outerHTML or (2) value property of an
object returned by createElement.
