The my_rand function in functions.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard)
before 1.4.12 does not properly use the PHP mt_rand function, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to an arbitrary
account by requesting a reset of the account's password, and then
conducting a brute-force attack.
