The _validatePost function in libs/controller/components/security.php
in CakePHP 1.3.x through 1.3.5 and 1.2.8 allows remote attackers to
modify the internal Cake cache and execute arbitrary code via a
crafted data[_Token][fields] value that is processed by the
unserialize function, as demonstrated by modifying the file_map cache
to execute arbitrary local files.
