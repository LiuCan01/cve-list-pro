Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Document Capture component in
Oracle Fusion Middleware 10.1.3.4 and 10.1.3.5 allows remote attackers
to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to Import
Server.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January
2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from the original
researcher that remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a full
pathname in the first argument to the ImportBodyText method in the
EasyMail ActiveX control (emsmtp.dll).
