Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata component
in Oracle Fusion Middleware 3.0.0.4 allows remote attackers to affect
availability via unknown vectors related to Server.  NOTE: the
previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle
has not commented on claims from a reliable third party researcher
that this is a buffer overflow via a crafted XML soap request and a
value that does not contain the expected 0x20 terminator character.
