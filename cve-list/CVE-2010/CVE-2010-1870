The OGNL extensive expression evaluation capability in XWork in Struts
2.0.0 through 2.1.8.1, as used in Atlassian Fisheye, Crucible, and
possibly other products, uses a permissive whitelist, which allows
remote attackers to modify server-side context objects and bypass the
"#" protection mechanism in ParameterInterceptors via the (1)
#context, (2) #_memberAccess, (3) #root, (4) #this, (5)
#_typeResolver, (6) #_classResolver, (7) #_traceEvaluations, (8)
#_lastEvaluation, (9) #_keepLastEvaluation, and possibly other OGNL
context variables, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-6504.
