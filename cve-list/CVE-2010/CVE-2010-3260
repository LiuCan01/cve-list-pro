oxf/xml/xerces/XercesSAXParserFactoryImpl.java in the xforms-server
component in the XForms service in Orbeon Forms before 3.9 does not
properly restrict DTDs in Ajax requests, which allows remote attackers
to read arbitrary files or send HTTP requests to intranet servers via
an entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related
to an "XML injection" issue.
