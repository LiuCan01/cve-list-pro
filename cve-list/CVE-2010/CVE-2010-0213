BIND 9.7.1 and 9.7.1-P1, when a recursive validating server has a
trust anchor that is configured statically or via DNSSEC Lookaside
Validation (DLV), allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop) via a query for an RRSIG record whose answer is not in
the cache, which causes BIND to repeatedly send RRSIG queries to the
authoritative servers.
