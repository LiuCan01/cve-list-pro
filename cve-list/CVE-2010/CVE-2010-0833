The pam_lsass library in Likewise Open 5.4 and CIFS 5.4 before build
8046, and 6.0 before build 8234, as used in HP StorageWorks X9000
Network Storage Systems and possibly other products, uses "SetPassword
logic" when running as part of a root service, which allows remote
attackers to bypass authentication for a Likewise Security Authority
(lsassd) account whose password is marked as expired.
