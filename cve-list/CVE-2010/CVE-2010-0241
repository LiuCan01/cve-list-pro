The TCP/IP implementation in Microsoft Windows Vista Gold, SP1, and
SP2 and Server 2008 Gold and SP2, when IPv6 is enabled, does not
properly perform bounds checking on ICMPv6 Route Information packets,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted
packets, aka "ICMPv6 Route Information Vulnerability."
