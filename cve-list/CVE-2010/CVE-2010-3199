Untrusted search path vulnerability in TortoiseSVN 1.6.10, Build 19898
and earlier allows local users, and possibly remote attackers, to
execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan
horse dwmapi.dll that is located in the same folder as a file that is
processed by Tortoise.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when a file
extension is associated with TortoiseProc or TortoiseMerge, which is
not the default.
