Acidcat CMS 3.5.x does not prevent access to install.asp after
installation finishes, which might allow remote attackers to restart
the installation process and have unspecified other impact via
requests to install.asp and other install_*.asp scripts.  NOTE: the
final installation screen states "Important: you must now delete all
files beginning with 'install' from the root directory."
