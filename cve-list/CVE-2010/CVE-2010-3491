ActiveMatrix Service Bus before 2.3.1, ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks
Service Engine before 5.8.1, and ActiveMatrix Service Performance
Manager before 1.3.2 do not properly handle JMX connections, which
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, obtain sensitive
information, or cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors.
