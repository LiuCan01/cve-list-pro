libspice, as used in QEMU-KVM in the Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor)
in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2 and qspice 0.3.0, does
not properly validate guest QXL driver pointers, which allows guest OS
users to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and
guest OS crash) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
