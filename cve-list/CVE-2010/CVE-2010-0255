Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 SP4, 6, 6 SP1, 7, and 8 does not
prevent rendering of non-HTML local files as HTML documents, which
allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and
read arbitrary files via vectors involving JavaScript exploit code
that constructs a reference to a file://127.0.0.1 URL, aka the dynamic
OBJECT tag vulnerability, as demonstrated by obtaining the data from
an index.dat file, a variant of CVE-2009-1140 and related to
CVE-2008-1448.
