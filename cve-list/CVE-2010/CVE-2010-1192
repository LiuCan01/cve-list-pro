libESMTP, probably 1.0.4 and earlier, does not properly handle a '0'
character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of
an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a
legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
