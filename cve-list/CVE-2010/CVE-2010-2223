Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM) in Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor (aka RHEV-H or rhev-hypervisor) before
5.5-2.2 does not properly perform VM post-zeroing after the removal of
a virtual machine's data, which allows guest OS users to obtain
sensitive information by examining the disk blocks associated with a
deleted virtual machine.
