DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2010-0751,
CVE-2010-1277.  Reason: this candidate was intended for one issue, but
it was accidentally assigned to two different issues, one for libnids
and another for Zabbix.  Notes: All CVE users should consult
CVE-2010-0751 (libnids) and CVE-2010-1277 (Zabbix) to determine which
ID is appropriate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate
have been removed to prevent accidental usage.
