Directory traversal vulnerability in the JE Form Creator
(com_jeformcr) component for Joomla!, when magic_quotes_gpc is
disabled, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via
directory traversal sequences in the view parameter to index.php.
NOTE: the original researcher states that the affected product is JE
Tooltip, not Form Creator; however, the exploit URL suggests that Form
Creator is affected.
