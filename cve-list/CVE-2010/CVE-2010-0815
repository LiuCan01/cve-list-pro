VBE6.DLL in Microsoft Office XP SP3, Office 2003 SP3, 2007 Microsoft
Office System SP1 and SP2, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and
VBA SDK 6.3 through 6.5 does not properly search for ActiveX controls
that are embedded in documents, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted document, aka "VBE6.DLL Stack
Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
