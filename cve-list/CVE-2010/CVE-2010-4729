Zikula before 1.2.3 does not use the authid protection mechanism for
(1) the lostpassword form and (2) mailpasswd processing, which makes
it easier for remote attackers to generate a flood of password
requests and possibly conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
attacks via multiple form submissions.
