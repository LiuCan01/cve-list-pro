Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in osDate 2.1.9 and
2.5.4, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled and register_globals is
enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
URL in the config[forum_installed] parameter to (1)
forum/adminLogin.php and (2) forum/userLogin.php.  NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
