Off-by-one error in the __opiereadrec function in readrec.c in libopie
in OPIE 2.4.1-test1 and earlier, as used on FreeBSD 6.4 through
8.1-PRERELEASE and other platforms, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
via a long username, as demonstrated by a long USER command to the
FreeBSD 8.0 ftpd.
