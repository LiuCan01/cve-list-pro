The design of the dialplan functionality in Asterisk Open Source
1.2.x, 1.4.x, and 1.6.x; and Asterisk Business Edition B.x.x and
C.x.x, when using the ${EXTEN} channel variable and wildcard pattern
matches, allows context-dependent attackers to inject strings into the
dialplan using metacharacters that are injected when the variable is
expanded, as demonstrated using the Dial application to process a
crafted SIP INVITE message that adds an unintended outgoing channel
leg.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is not a vulnerability in
Asterisk, but a class of vulnerabilities that can occur in any program
that uses this feature without the associated filtering functionality
that is already available.
