** DISPUTED ** Race condition in DefenseWall Personal Firewall 3.00 on
Windows XP allows local users to bypass kernel-mode hook handlers, and
execute dangerous code that would otherwise be blocked by a handler
but not blocked by signature-based malware detection, via certain
user-space memory changes during hook-handler execution, aka an
argument-switch attack or a KHOBE attack.  NOTE: this issue is disputed
by some third parties because it is a flaw in a protection mechanism
for situations where a crafted program has already begun to execute.
