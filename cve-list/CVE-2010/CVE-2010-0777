The Web Container in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.0 before
6.0.2.43, 6.1 before 6.1.0.31, and 7.0 before 7.0.0.11 does not
properly handle long filenames and consequently sends an incorrect
file in some responses, which allows remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information by reading the retrieved file.
