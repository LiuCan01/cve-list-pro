The administrative interface on the PolyVision RoomWizard with
firmware 3.2.3 places the Sync Connector Active Directory (AD)
credentials in a web form that is accessed over HTTP on port 80, which
allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the
HTML source code corresponding to the /admin/sign/DeviceSynch URI.
