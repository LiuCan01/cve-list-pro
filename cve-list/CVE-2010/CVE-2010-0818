The MPEG-4 codec in the Windows Media codecs in Microsoft Windows XP
SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP2, Vista SP1 and SP2, and Server 2008 Gold
and SP2 does not properly handle crafted media content with MPEG-4
video encoding, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code via a file in an unspecified "supported format," aka "MPEG-4
Codec Vulnerability."
