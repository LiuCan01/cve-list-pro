Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 6 SP1, 7, and 8 does not properly
handle objects in memory, which allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code by accessing an object that (1) was not properly
initialized or (2) is deleted, leading to memory corruption, aka "HTML
Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
