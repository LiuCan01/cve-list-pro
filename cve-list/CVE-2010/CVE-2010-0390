Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in maxImageUpload/index.php in
PHP F1 Max's Image Uploader 1.0, when Apache is not configured to
handle the mime-type for files with pjpeg or jpeg extensions, allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with a
pjpeg or jpeg extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the
file in original/.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third
party information.
