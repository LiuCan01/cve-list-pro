The _CalcHashValueWithLength function in FastBackServer.exe in the
Server in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) FastBack 5.5.0.0 through
5.5.6.0 and 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.1 does not properly validate an
unspecified length value, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) by sending data over TCP.  NOTE: this
might overlap CVE-2010-3060.
