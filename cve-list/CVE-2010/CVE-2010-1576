The Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS) 11500 with software before
8.20.4.02 and the Application Control Engine (ACE) 4710 with software
before A2(3.0) do not properly handle use of LF, CR, and LFCR as
alternatives to the standard CRLF sequence between HTTP headers, which
allows remote attackers to bypass intended header insertions or
conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via crafted header data, as
demonstrated by LF characters preceding ClientCert-Subject and
ClientCert-Subject-CN headers, aka Bug ID CSCta04885.
