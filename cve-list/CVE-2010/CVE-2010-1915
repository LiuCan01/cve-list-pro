The preg_quote function in PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through
5.3.2 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive
information (memory contents) by causing a userspace interruption of
an internal function, related to the call time pass by reference
feature, modification of ZVALs whose values are not updated in the
associated local variables, and access of previously-freed memory.
