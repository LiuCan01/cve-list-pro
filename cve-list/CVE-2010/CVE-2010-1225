The memory-management implementation in the Virtual Machine Monitor
(aka VMM or hypervisor) in Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 Gold and SP1,
Virtual Server 2005 Gold and R2 SP1, and Windows Virtual PC does not
properly restrict access from the guest OS to memory locations in the
VMM work area, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass
certain anti-exploitation protection mechanisms on the guest OS via
crafted input to a vulnerable application.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly
found that only systems with an otherwise vulnerable application are
affected, because "the memory areas accessible from the guest cannot
be leveraged to achieve either remote code execution or elevation of
privilege and ... no data from the host is exposed to the guest OS."
