The Director module (dirapi.dll) in Adobe Shockwave Player before
11.5.9.615 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
a denial of service (memory corruption) via a Director movie with a
crafted rcsL chunk containing a field whose value is used as a pointer
offset, as exploited in the wild in October 2010. NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
