Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 SP4, 6, 6 SP1, 7, and 8 does not
prevent rendering of non-HTML local files as HTML documents, which
allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and
read arbitrary files via vectors involving the product's use of
text/html as the default content type for files that are encountered
after a redirection, aka the URLMON sniffing vulnerability, a variant
of CVE-2009-1140 and related to CVE-2008-1448.
