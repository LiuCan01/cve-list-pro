Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the addItem method in the
Menu widget in YUI before 2.9.0 allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via a field that is added to a menu,
related to documentation that specifies this field as a text field
rather than an HTML field, a similar issue to CVE-2010-4569 and
CVE-2010-4570.
