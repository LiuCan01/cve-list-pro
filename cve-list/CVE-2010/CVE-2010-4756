The glob implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU
and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match
any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in STAT commands to
an FTP daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
