The Print Spooler service in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows
Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold,
SP2, and R2, and Windows 7, when printer sharing is enabled, does not
properly validate spooler access permissions, which allows remote
attackers to create files in a system directory, and consequently
execute arbitrary code, by sending a crafted print request over RPC,
as exploited in the wild in September 2010, aka "Print Spooler Service
Impersonation Vulnerability."
