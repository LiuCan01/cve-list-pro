/opt/rv/Versions/CurrentVersion/Mcu/Config/Mcu.val in Cisco Unified
Videoconferencing (UVC) System 5110 and 5115, when the Linux operating
system is used, uses a weak hashing algorithm for the (1)
administrator and (2) operator passwords, which makes it easier for
local users to obtain sensitive information by recovering the
cleartext values, aka Bug ID CSCti54010.
