The x86 emulator in KVM 83 does not use the Current Privilege Level
(CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL) in determining the memory access
available to CPL3 code, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial
of service (guest OS crash) or gain privileges on the guest OS by
leveraging access to a (1) IO port or (2) MMIO region, a related issue
to CVE-2010-0306.
