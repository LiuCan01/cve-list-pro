Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Gambit Design
Bandwidth Meter, 0.72 and possibly 1.2, allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO to (1)
view_by_name.php or (2) view_by_ip.php in admin/.  NOTE: some sources
report that the affected product is ShaPlus Bandwidth Meter, but this
is incorrect.
