Unspecified vulnerability in the Services for Beehive component in
Oracle Fusion Middleware 2.0.1.0, 2.0.1.1, 2.0.1.2, 2.0.1.2.1, and
2.0.1.3 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on
claims from a reliable third party coordinator that
voice-servlet/prompt-qa/Index.jspf does not properly handle null (%00)
bytes in the evaluation parameter that is used in a filename, which
allows attackers to create a file with an executable extension and
execute arbitrary JSP code.
