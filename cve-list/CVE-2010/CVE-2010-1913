The default configuration of pluginlicense.ini for the
SdcWebSecureBase interface in tgctlcm.dll in Consona Live Assistance,
Dynamic Agent, and Subscriber Assistance, when downloaded from a
server operated by Telefonica or possibly other companies, contains an
incorrect DNS whitelist that includes the DNS hostnames of home
computers of many persons, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended restrictions on ActiveX execution by hosting an ActiveX
control on an applicable home web server.
