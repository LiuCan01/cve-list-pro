Untrusted search path vulnerability in Wireshark 0.8.4 through 1.0.15
and 1.2.0 through 1.2.10 allows local users, and possibly remote
attackers, to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks
via a Trojan horse airpcap.dll, and possibly other DLLs, that is
located in the same folder as a file that automatically launches
Wireshark.
