The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
on Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) 5500 series devices with
software 8.2(3) and earlier, and Cisco PIX Security Appliances
devices, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption and device hang) by sending many Router Advertisement (RA)
messages with different source addresses, as demonstrated by the
flood_router6 program in the thc-ipv6 package, aka Bug ID CSCti24526.
