The SV_CheckForDuplicateNames function in Valve Software Half-Life
CSTRIKE Dedicated Server 1.1.1.0 and earlier allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and
daemon hang) via a certain connection string to UDP port 27015 that
represents "absence of player informations," a related issue to
CVE-2006-0734.
