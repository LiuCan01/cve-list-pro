The ckconfig command in lsadmin for Load Sharing Facility (LSF) 5.1
allows local users to execute arbitrary programs by modifying the
LSF_ENVDIR environment variable to reference an alternate lsf.conf
file, then modifying LSF_SERVERDIR to point to a malicious lim
program, which lsadmin then executes.
