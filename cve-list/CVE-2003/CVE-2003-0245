Vulnerability in the apr_psprintf function in the Apache Portable
Runtime (APR) library for Apache 2.0.37 through 2.0.45 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via long strings, as demonstrated using XML objects to
mod_dav, and possibly other vectors.
