Openwebmail in cPanel 5.0, when run using suid Perl, adds the
directory in the SCRIPT_FILENAME environment variable to Perl's @INC
include array, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code by
modifying SCRIPT_FILENAME to reference a directory containing a
malicious openwebmail-shared.pl executable.
