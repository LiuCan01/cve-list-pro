** DISPUTED **

The mod_php module for the Apache HTTP Server allows local users with
write access to PHP scripts to send signals to the server's process
group and use the server's file descriptors, as demonstrated by
sending a STOP signal, then intercepting incoming connections on the
server's TCP port.  NOTE: the PHP developer has disputed this
vulnerability, saying "The opened file descriptors are opened by
Apache. It is the job of Apache to protect them ... Not a bug in PHP."
