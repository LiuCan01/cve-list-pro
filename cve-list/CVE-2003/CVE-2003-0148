The default installation of MSDE via McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 2.0
through 3.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a series of
steps that (1) obtain the database administrator username and
encrypted password in a configuration file from the ePO server using a
certain request, (2) crack the password due to weak cryptography, and
(3) use the password to pass commands through xp_cmdshell.
