VERITAS File System (VxFS) 3.3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 before MP1 Rolling
Patch 02 for Sun Solaris 2.5.1 through 9 does not properly implement
inheritance of default ACLs in certain circumstances related to the
characteristics of a directory inode, which allows local users to
bypass intended file permissions by accessing a file on a VxFS
filesystem.
