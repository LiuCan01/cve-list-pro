Sun ONE (aka iPlanet) Web Server 4.1 through SP12 and 6.0 through SP5,
when DNS resolution is enabled for client IP addresses, allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files, and conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks involving the iPlanet Log Analyzer,
via an HTTP request in conjunction with a crafted DNS response,
related to an "Inverse Lookup Log Corruption (ILLC)" issue, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2002-1315 and CVE-2002-1316.
