Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/11397

The implementation of SYN cookies (syncookies) in FreeBSD 4.5 through
5.0-RELEASE-p3 uses only 32-bit internal keys when generating
syncookies, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
brute force ISN guessing attacks and spoof legitimate traffic.
