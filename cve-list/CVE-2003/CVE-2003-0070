VTE, as used by default in gnome-terminal terminal emulator 2.2 and as
an option in gnome-terminal 2.0, allows attackers to modify the window
title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back
to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a
file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker
to execute arbitrary commands.
