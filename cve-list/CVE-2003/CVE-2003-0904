Microsoft Exchange 2003 and Outlook Web Access (OWA), when configured
to use NTLM authentication, does not properly reuse HTTP connections,
which can cause OWA users to view mailboxes of other users when
Kerberos has been disabled as an authentication method for IIS 6.0,
e.g. when SharePoint Services 2.0 is installed.
