Reference: XF:terminal-emulator-window-title(11414)
Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/11414.php

The xterm terminal emulator in XFree86 4.2.0 and earlier allows
attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape
sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's
terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious
sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
commands.
