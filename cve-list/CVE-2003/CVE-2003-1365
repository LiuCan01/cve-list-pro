The escape_dangerous_chars function in CGI::Lite 2.0 and earlier does
not correctly remove special characters including (1) "" (backslash),
(2) "?", (3) "~" (tilde), (4) "^" (carat), (5) newline, or (6)
carriage return, which could allow remote attackers to read or write
arbitrary files, or execute arbitrary commands, in shell scripts that
rely on CGI::Lite to filter such dangerous inputs.
