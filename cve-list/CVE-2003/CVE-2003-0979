FreeScripts VisitorBook LE (visitorbook.pl) does not properly escape
line breaks in input, which allows remote attackers to (1) use
VisitorBook as an open mail relay, when $mailuser is 1, via extra
headers in the email field, or (2) cause the guestbook database to be
deleted via a large number of line breaks that exceeds the $max_posts
variable.
