SSH2 clients for VanDyke (1) SecureCRT 4.0.2 and 3.4.7, (2) SecureFX
2.1.2 and 2.0.4, and (3) Entunnel 1.0.2 and earlier, do not clear
logon credentials from memory, including plaintext passwords, which
could allow attackers with access to memory to steal the SSH
credentials.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(2) Baker, Stracener
   NOOP(4) Cole, Cox, Green, Wall

Voter Comments:
 Green> MULTIPLE VENDORS INVOLVED
 Stracener> I'm going to go with this because at least two of the affected vendors acknowledged a fix in the original advisory.
