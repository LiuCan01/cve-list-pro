Sun Cluster 2.2 through 3.2 for Oracle Parallel Server / Real
Application Clusters (OPS/RAC) allows local users to cause a denial of
service (cluster node panic or abort) by launching a daemon listening
on a TCP port that would otherwise be used by the Distributed Lock
Manager (DLM), possibly involving this daemon responding in a manner
that spoofs a cluster reconfiguration.
