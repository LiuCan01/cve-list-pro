The getCanonicalPath function in Windows NT 4.0 may free memory that
it does not own and cause heap corruption, which allows attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) via requests that cause a long file
name to be passed to getCanonicalPath, as demonstrated on the IBM JVM
using a long string to the java.io.getCanonicalPath Java method.
