register.php in S8Forum 3.0 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP commands by creating a user whose name ends in a .php
extension and entering the desired commands into the E-mail field,
which creates a web-accessible .php file that can be called by the
attacker, as demonstrated using a "system($cmd)" E-mail address with a
"any_name.php" username.
