X Fontserver for Truetype fonts (xfstt) 1.4 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
(1) FS_QueryXExtents8 or (2) FS_QueryXBitmaps8 packet, and possibly
other types of packets, with a large num_ranges value, which causes an
out-of-bounds array access.
