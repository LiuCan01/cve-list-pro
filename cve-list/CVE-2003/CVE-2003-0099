 Christey> As observed in an email to us by a third party, it appears
   that 3.8.6 is probably not affected by this, so the
   description should be changed to refer to "3.10.x before
   3.10.5, and 3.8.x before 3.8.6".
 Christey> An email from Kern Sibbald on August 21, 2003, confirmed that
   3.8.6 and 3.10.5 fixed the issue.
