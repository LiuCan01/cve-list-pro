The PNG deflate algorithm in RealOne Player 6.0.11.x and earlier,
RealPlayer 8/RealPlayer Plus 8 6.0.9.584, and other versions allows
remote attackers to corrupt the heap and overwrite arbitrary memory
via a PNG graphic file format containing compressed data using fixed
trees that contain the length values 286-287, which are treated as a
very large length.
