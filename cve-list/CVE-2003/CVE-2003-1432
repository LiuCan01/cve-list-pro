Epic Games Unreal Engine 226f through 436 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via (1) a packet with a negative size value,
which is treated as a large positive number during memory allocation,
or (2) a negative size value in a package file.
