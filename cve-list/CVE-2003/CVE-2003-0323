Multiple buffer overflows in ircII 20020912 allows remote malicious
IRC servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via responses that are not properly fed to the
my_strcat function by (1) ctcp_buffer, (2) cannot_join_channel, (3)
status_make_printable for Statusbar drawing, (4) create_server_list,
and possibly other functions.
