The default .htaccess scripts for Bugzilla 2.14.x before 2.14.5,
2.16.x before 2.16.2, and 2.17.x before 2.17.3 do not include
filenames for backup copies of the localconfig file that are made from
editors such as vi and Emacs, which could allow remote attackers to
obtain a database password by directly accessing the backup file.
