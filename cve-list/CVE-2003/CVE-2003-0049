password.


Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Baker, Cole, Green
   NOOP(2) Cox, Wall

Voter Comments:
 Baker> Realizing they have acknowledged the problem, and provided a fix by allowing the administrator to select whether or not this is allowed,
   I am not sure this should really be a vulnerability.  If you are the administrator on a system, there are other ways I can become a user
   on a system.  The fact that you are the administrator (root) you can do almost anything to the system you want, including accessing files
   and programs that belong to other users.  From a security standpoint, if the system gets "hacked" and the administrator account is compromised,
   how big of an issue is it really that the administrator can now access regular user accounts with the administrator password?  I am not sure this
   should really be a vulnerability.
 CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]
