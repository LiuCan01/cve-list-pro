PHP remote file include vulnerability in index.php for Gallery 1.4 and
1.4-pl1, when running on Windows or in Configuration mode on Unix,
allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the
GALLERY_BASEDIR parameter, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2002-1412.  NOTE: this issue might be exploitable only during
installation, or if the administrator has not run a security script
after installation.
