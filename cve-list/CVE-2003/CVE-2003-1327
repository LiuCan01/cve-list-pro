Buffer overflow in the SockPrintf function in wu-ftpd 2.6.2 and
earlier, when compiled with MAIL_ADMIN option enabled on a system that
supports very long pathnames, might allow remote anonymous users to
execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with a long pathname, which
triggers the overflow when wu-ftpd constructs a notification message
to the administrator.
