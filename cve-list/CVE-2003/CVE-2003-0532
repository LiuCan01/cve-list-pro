Internet Explorer 5.01 SP3 through 6.0 SP1 does not properly determine
object types that are returned by web servers, which could allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an object tag with a
data parameter to a malicious file hosted on a server that returns an
unsafe Content-Type, aka the "Object Type" vulnerability.
