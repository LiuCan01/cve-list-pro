Reference: XF:terminal-emulator-window-title(11414)
Reference: URL:http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/11414.php

The rxvt terminal emulator 2.7.8 and earlier allows attackers to
modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and
then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal,
e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence,
which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
