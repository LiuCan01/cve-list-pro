Category: SF
Reference: IDEFENSE:20030625 PHP/Apache .htaccess Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
Reference: URL:http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=97

** DISPUTED **

PHP treats unknown methods such as "PoSt" as a GET request, which
could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is
running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd
2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive.  NOTE: this issue has
been disputed by the Apache security team, saying "It is by design
that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which
does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed
as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour
that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache
configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."
