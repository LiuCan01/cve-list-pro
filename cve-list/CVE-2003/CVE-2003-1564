libxml2, possibly before 2.5.0, does not properly detect recursion
during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted
XML document containing a large number of nested entity references,
aka the "billion laughs attack."
