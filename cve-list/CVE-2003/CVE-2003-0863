Reference: BUGTRAQ:20030716 PHP safe mode broken?
Reference: URL:http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=105839111204227

The php_check_safe_mode_include_dir function in fopen_wrappers.c of
PHP 4.3.x returns a success value (0) when the safe_mode_include_dir
variable is not specified in configuration, which differs from the
previous failure value and may allow remote attackers to exploit file
include vulnerabilities in PHP applications.
