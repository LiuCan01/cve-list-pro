Stack-based buffer overflow in Active Directory in Windows 2000 before
SP4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via an LDAP version 3 search request
with a large number of (1) "AND," (2) "OR," and possibly other
statements, which causes LSASS.EXE to crash.
