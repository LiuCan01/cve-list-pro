Sun ONE (aka iPlanet) Web Server 6 on Windows, when DNS resolution is
enabled for client IP addresses, uses a logging format that does not
identify whether a dotted quad represents an unresolved IP address,
which allows remote attackers to spoof IP addresses via crafted DNS
responses containing numerical top-level domains, as demonstrated by a
forged 123.123.123.123 domain name, related to an "Inverse Lookup Log
Corruption (ILLC)" issue.
