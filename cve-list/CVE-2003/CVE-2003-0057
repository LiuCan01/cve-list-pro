Multiple buffer overflows in Hypermail 2 before 2.1.6 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
code (1) via a long attachment filename that is not properly handled
by the hypermail executable, or (2) by connecting to the mail CGI
program from an IP address that reverse-resolves to a long hostname.
