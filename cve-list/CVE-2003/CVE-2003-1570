The server in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) 5.1.x, 5.2.x before
5.2.1.2, and 6.x before 6.1 does not require credentials to observe
the server console in some circumstances, which allows remote
authenticated administrators to monitor server operations by
establishing a console mode session, related to "session exposure."
