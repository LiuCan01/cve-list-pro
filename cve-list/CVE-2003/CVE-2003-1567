The undocumented TRACK method in Microsoft Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 returns the content of the original request in the
body of the response, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
steal cookies and authentication credentials, or bypass the HttpOnly
protection mechanism, by using TRACK to read the contents of the HTTP
headers that are returned in the response, a technique that is similar
to cross-site tracing (XST) using HTTP TRACE.
