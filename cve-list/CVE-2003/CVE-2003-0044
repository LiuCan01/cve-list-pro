Current Votes:
   ACCEPT(3) Armstrong, Cole, Green
   MODIFY(1) Cox
   NOOP(1) Christey
   REVIEWING(1) Jones

Voter Comments:
 Jones> [JHJ] XSS really "execute arbitrary web script"?
 CHANGE> [Cox changed vote from NOOP to MODIFY]
 Cox> "Agree with Jones, wording on effect of a XSS could be better"
 Christey> I've been trying to devise reasonable-but-short wordings for
   XSS issues and the terminology just isn't quite there yet.  This
   description is clearly a failed wording, however :-)
