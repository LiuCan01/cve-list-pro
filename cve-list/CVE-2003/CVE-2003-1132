The DNS server for Cisco Content Service Switch (CSS) 11000 and 11500,
when prompted for a nonexistent AAAA record, responds with response
code 3 (NXDOMAIN or "Name Error") instead of response code 0 ("No
Error"), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(inaccessible domain) by forcing other DNS servers to send and cache a
request for a AAAA record to the vulnerable server.
