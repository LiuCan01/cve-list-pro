Services in ScriptLogic 4.01, and possibly other versions before 4.14,
process client requests at raised privileges, which allows remote
attackers to (1) modify arbitrary registry entries via the ScriptLogic
RPC service (SLRPC) or (2) modify arbitrary configuration via the
RunAdmin services (SLRAserver.exe and SLRAclient.exe).
