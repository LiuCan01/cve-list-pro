Multiple content security gateway and antivirus products allow remote
attackers to bypass content restrictions via MIME messages that use
malformed quoting in MIME headers, parameters, and values, including
(1) fields that should not be quoted, (2) duplicate quotes, or (3)
missing leading or trailing quote characters, which may be interpreted
differently by mail clients.
