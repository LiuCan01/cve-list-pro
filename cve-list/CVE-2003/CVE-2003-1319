Multiple buffer overflows in SmartFTP 1.0.973, and other versions
before 1.0.976, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
(1) a long response to a PWD command, which triggers a stack-based
overflow, and (2) a long line in a response to a file LIST command,
which triggers a heap-based overflow.
