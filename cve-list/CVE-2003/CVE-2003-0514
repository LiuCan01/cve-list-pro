Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/vulnwatch/2004-q1/0056.html

Apple Safari allows remote attackers to bypass intended cookie access
restrictions on a web application via "%2e%2e" (encoded dot dot)
directory traversal sequences in a URL, which causes Safari to send
the cookie outside the specified URL subsets, e.g. to a vulnerable
application that runs on the same server as the target application.

 Christey> Consider whether this is really a design-level problem that applies to
   the interaction between any vulnerable XSS, its associated domain, and
   any web browser, because browsers enforce security boundaries at the
   domain level.  If so, then the "%2e%2e" problem may be a red herring,
   or a single attack vector of any number of vectors.

   and CVE-2003-0594 all cover this specific issue (each for a
   different browser).
