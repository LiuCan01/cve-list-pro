Reference: BUGTRAQ:20030902 IRM 007: The IP addresses of Check Point Firewall-1 internal interfaces may be enumerated using SecuRemote
Reference: URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2003-09/0018.html

Check Point FireWall-1 4.0 and 4.1 before SP5 allows remote attackers
to obtain the IP addresses of internal interfaces via certain
SecuRemote requests to TCP ports 256 or 264, which leaks the IP
addresses in a reply packet.
