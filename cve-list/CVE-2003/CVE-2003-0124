Reference: XF:man-myxsprintf-code-execution(11512)
Reference: URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/11512

man before 1.5l allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
malformed man file with improper quotes, which causes the my_xsprintf
function to return a string with the value "unsafe," which is then
executed as a program via a system call if it is in the search path of
the user who runs man.
