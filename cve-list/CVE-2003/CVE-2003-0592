Konqueror in KDE 3.1.3 and earlier (kdelibs) allows remote attackers
to bypass intended cookie access restrictions on a web application via
"%2e%2e" (encoded dot dot) directory traversal sequences in a URL,
which causes Konqueror to send the cookie outside the specified URL
subsets, e.g. to a vulnerable application that runs on the same server
as the target application.

 Christey> Consider whether this is really a design-level problem that applies to
   the interaction between any vulnerable XSS, its associated domain, and
   any web browser, because browsers enforce security boundaries at the
   domain level.  If so, then the "%2e%2e" problem may be a red herring,
   or a single attack vector of any number of vectors.

   different browser).
