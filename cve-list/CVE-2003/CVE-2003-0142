Adobe Acrobat Reader (acroread) 6, under certain circumstances when
running with the "Certified plug-ins only" option disabled, loads
plug-ins with signatures used for older versions of Acrobat, which can
allow attackers to cause Acrobat to enter Certified mode and run
untrusted plugins by modifying the CTIsCertifiedMode function.
