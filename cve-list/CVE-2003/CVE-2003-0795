The vty layer in Quagga before 0.96.4, and Zebra 0.93b and earlier,
does not verify that sub-negotiation is taking place when processing
the SE marker, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) via a malformed telnet command to the telnet CLI port,
which may trigger a null dereference.
