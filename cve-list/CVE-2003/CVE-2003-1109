The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in multiple Cisco
products including IP Phone models 7940 and 7960, IOS versions in the
12.2 train, and Secure PIX 5.2.9 to 6.2.2 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via
crafted INVITE messages, as demonstrated by the OUSPG PROTOS c07-sip
test suite.
