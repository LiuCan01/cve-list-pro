Sun ONE (aka iPlanet) Web Server 4.1 through SP12 and 6.0 through SP5,
when DNS resolution is enabled for client IP addresses, allows remote
attackers to hide HTTP requests from the log-preview functionality by
accompanying the requests with crafted DNS responses specifying a
domain name beginning with a "format=" substring, related to an
"Inverse Lookup Log Corruption (ILLC)" issue.
