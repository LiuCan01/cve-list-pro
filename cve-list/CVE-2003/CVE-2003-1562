sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled
and using PAM keyboard-interactive authentication, does not insert a
delay after a root login attempt with the correct password, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to
determine if the password step of a multi-step authentication is
successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.
