Multiple off-by-one buffer overflows in the IMAP capability for Mutt
1.3.28 and earlier, and Balsa 1.2.4 and earlier, allow a remote
malicious IMAP server to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted mail folder, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0140.
