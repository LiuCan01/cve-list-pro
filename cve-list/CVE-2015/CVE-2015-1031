Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in Privoxy before 3.0.22 allow
remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors related to (1)
the unmap function in list.c or (2) "two additional unconfirmed
use-after-free complaints made by Coverity scan." NOTE: some of these
details are obtained from third party information.
