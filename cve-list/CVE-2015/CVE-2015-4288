Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=40137

The LDAP implementation on the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)
8.5.0-000, Email Security Appliance (ESA) 8.5.7-042, and Content
Security Management Appliance (SMA) 8.3.6-048 does not verify X.509
certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a
crafted certificate, aka Bug IDs CSCuo29561, CSCuv40466, and
CSCuv40470.
