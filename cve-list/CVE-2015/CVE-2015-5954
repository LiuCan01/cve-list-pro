The virtual filesystem in ownCloud Server before 6.0.9, 7.0.x before
7.0.7, and 8.0.x before 8.0.5 does not consider that NULL is a valid
getPath return value, which allows remote authenticated users to
bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to users files via
a sharing link to a file with a deleted parent folder.
