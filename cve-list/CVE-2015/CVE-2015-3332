A certain backport in the TCP Fast Open implementation for the Linux
kernel before 3.18 does not properly maintain a count value, which
allow local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via the
Fast Open feature, as demonstrated by visiting the
chrome://flags/#enable-tcp-fast-open URL when using certain 3.10.x
through 3.16.x kernel builds, including longterm-maintenance releases
and ckt (aka Canonical Kernel Team) builds.
