Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not always ask the user before
proceeding with CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_FULLSCREEN and
CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_MOUSELOCK changes, which allows user-assisted
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (UI disruption) by
constructing a crafted HTML document containing JavaScript code with
requestFullScreen and requestPointerLock calls, and arranging for the
user to access this document with a file: URL.
