server/network/protocol/http/OHttpSessionManager.java in the Studio
component in OrientDB Server Community Edition before 2.0.15 and 2.1.x
before 2.1.1 improperly relies on the java.util.Random class for
generation of random Session ID values, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to predict a value by determining the internal state
of the PRNG in this class.
