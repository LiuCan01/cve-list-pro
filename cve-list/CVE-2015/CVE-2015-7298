Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7298
Phase: Assigned (20150921)
Category: 
Reference: CONFIRM:https://owncloud.org/security/advisory/?id=oc-sa-2015-016

ownCloud Desktop Client before 2.0.1, when compiled with a Qt release
after 5.3.x, does not call QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors with the
list of errors to be ignored, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by leveraging a
server using a self-signed certificate.  NOTE: this vulnerability
exists because of a partial CVE-2015-4456 regression.
