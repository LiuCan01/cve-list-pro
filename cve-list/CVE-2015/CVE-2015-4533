EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7SP1 P32, 6.7SP2 before P25,
7.0 before P19, 7.1 before P16, and 7.2 before P02 does not properly
check authorization after creation of an object, which allows remote
authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with super-user
privileges via a custom script.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2513.
