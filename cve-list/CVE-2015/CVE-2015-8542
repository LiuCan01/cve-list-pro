An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange Guard before 2.2.0-rev8. The
"getprivkeybyid" API call is used to download a PGP Private Key for a
specific user after providing authentication credentials. Clients
provide the "id" and "cid" parameter to specify the current user by its
user- and context-ID. The "auth" parameter contains a hashed password
string which gets created by the client by asking the user to enter his
or her OX Guard password. This parameter is used as single point of
authentication when accessing PGP Private Keys. In case a user has set
the same password as another user, it is possible to download another
user's PGP Private Key by iterating the "id" and "cid" parameters. This
kind of attack would also be able by brute-forcing login credentials,
but since the "id" and "cid" parameters are sequential they are much
easier to predict than a user's login name. At the same time, there are
some obvious insecure standard passwords that are widely used. A
attacker could send the hashed representation of typically weak
passwords and randomly fetch Private Key of matching accounts. The
attack can be executed by both internal users and "guests" which use
the external mail reader.
