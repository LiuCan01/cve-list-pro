Phase: Assigned (20170803)
Category: 
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/theguly/DecryptOpManager

Zoho ManageEngine OpManager 11 through 12.2 uses a custom encryption
algorithm to protect the credential used to access the monitored
devices. The implemented algorithm doesn't use a per-system key or even
a salt; therefore, it's possible to create a universal decryptor.
