Directory traversal vulnerability in the SwiftKey language-pack update
implementation on Samsung Galaxy S4, S4 Mini, S5, and S6 devices
allows remote web servers to write to arbitrary files, and
consequently execute arbitrary code in a privileged context, by
leveraging control of the skslm.swiftkey.net domain name and providing
a .. (dot dot) in an entry in a ZIP archive, as demonstrated by a
traversal to the /data/dalvik-cache directory.
