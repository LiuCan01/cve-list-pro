chrony before 1.31.1 does not initialize the last "next" pointer when
saving unacknowledged replies to command requests, which allows remote
authenticated users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized
pointer dereference and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code via a large number of command requests.
