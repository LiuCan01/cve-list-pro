The Red Hat docker package before 1.5.0-28, when using the
--add-registry option, falls back to HTTP when the HTTPS connection to
the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by
leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to
block HTTPS traffic.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a
CVE-2014-5277 regression.
