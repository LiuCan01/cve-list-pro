The V8ThrowException::createDOMException function in
bindings/core/v8/V8ThrowException.cpp in the V8 bindings in Blink, as
used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.111 on Windows, OS X, and Linux
and before 40.0.2214.109 on Android, does not properly consider frame
access restrictions during the throwing of an exception, which allows
remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web
site.
