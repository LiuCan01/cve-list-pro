Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Object Library
component in Oracle E-Business Suite 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, and
12.2.4 allows remote attackers to affect integrity via unknown vectors
related to Single Signon.  NOTE: the previous information is from the
October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that
this issue is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the Domain
parameter in the CfgOCIReturn servlet.
