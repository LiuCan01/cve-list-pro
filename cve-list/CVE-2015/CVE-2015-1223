Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in
core/html/HTMLInputElement.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as
used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
via vectors that trigger extraneous change events, as demonstrated by
events for invalid input or input to read-only fields, related to the
initializeTypeInParsing and updateType functions.
