Reference: MISC:https://www.modzero.ch/advisories/MZ-15-03-GOOD-Auth-Delegation.txt

The Good for Enterprise application 3.0.0.415 for Android does not use
signature protection for its Authentication Delegation API intent.
Also, the Good Dynamic application activation process does not attempt
to detect malicious activation attempts involving modified names
beginning with a com.good.gdgma substring. Consequently, an attacker
could obtain access to intranet data. This issue is only relevant in
cases where the user has already downloaded a malicious Android
application.
