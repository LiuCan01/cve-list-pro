The overlayfs implementation in the linux (aka Linux kernel) package
before 3.19.0-21.21 in Ubuntu through 15.04 does not properly check
permissions for file creation in the upper filesystem directory, which
allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging a configuration
in which overlayfs is permitted in an arbitrary mount namespace.
