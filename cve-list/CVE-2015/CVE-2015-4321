The Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) implementation in Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 9.3(1.50), 9.3(2.100),
9.3(3), and 9.4(1) mishandles cases where an IP address belongs to an
internal interface but is also in the ASA routing table, which allows
remote attackers to bypass uRPF validation via spoofed packets, aka
Bug ID CSCuv60724.
