NETGEAR D3600 devices with firmware 1.0.0.49 and D6000 devices with
firmware 1.0.0.49 and earlier use the same hardcoded private key
across different customers' installations, which allows remote
attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging
knowledge of this key from another installation.
