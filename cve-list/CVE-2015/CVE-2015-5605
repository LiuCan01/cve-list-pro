The regular-expression implementation in Google V8, as used in Google
Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, mishandles interrupts, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted
JavaScript code, as demonstrated by an error in garbage collection
during allocation of a stack-overflow exception message.
