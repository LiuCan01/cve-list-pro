Schneider Electric InduSoft Web Studio before 7.1.3.4 SP3 Patch 4 and
InTouch Machine Edition 2014 before 7.1.3.4 SP3 Patch 4 rely on a
hardcoded cleartext password to control read access to Project files
and Project Configuration files, which makes it easier for local users
to obtain sensitive information by discovering this password.
