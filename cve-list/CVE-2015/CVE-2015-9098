In Redgate SQL Monitor before 3.10 and 4.x before 4.2, a remote
attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the Base Monitor, resulting
in the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on any monitored
Microsoft SQL Server machines. If the Base Monitor is connecting to
these machines using an account with SQL admin privileges, then code
execution on the operating system can result in full system compromise
(if Microsoft SQL Server is running with local administrator
privileges).
