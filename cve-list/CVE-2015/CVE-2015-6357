The rule-update feature in Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center (MC) 5.2
through 5.4.0.1 does not verify the X.509 certificate of the
support.sourcefire.com SSL server, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to spoof this server and provide an invalid package, and
consequently execute arbitrary code, via a crafted certificate, aka
Bug ID CSCuw06444.
