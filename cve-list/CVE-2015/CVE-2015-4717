The filename sanitization component in ownCloud Server before 6.0.8,
7.0.x before 7.0.6, and 8.0.x before 8.0.4 does not properly handle
$_GET parameters cast by PHP to an array, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and log file
consumption) via crafted endpoint file names.
