The ap_some_auth_required function in server/request.c in the Apache
HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require
directive may be associated with an authorization setting rather than
an authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass
intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by
leveraging the presence of a module that relies on the 2.2 API
behavior.
