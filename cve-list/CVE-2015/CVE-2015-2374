The Netlogon service in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 and R2 SP2,
Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and
R2 does not properly implement domain-controller communication, which
allows remote attackers to discover credentials by leveraging certain
PDC access and spoofing the BDC role in a PDC communication channel,
aka "Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in Netlogon."
