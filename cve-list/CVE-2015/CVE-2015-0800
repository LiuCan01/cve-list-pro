The PRNG implementation in the DNS resolver in Mozilla Firefox (aka
Fennec) before 37.0 on Android does not properly generate random
numbers for query ID values and UDP source ports, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses by guessing these
numbers, a related issue to CVE-2012-2808.
