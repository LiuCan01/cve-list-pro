The pcs daemon (pcsd) in PCS 0.9.137 and earlier does not include the
HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script
access to this cookie.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2015-1848
per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types.
