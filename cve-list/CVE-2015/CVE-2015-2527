The process-initialization implementation in win32k.sys in the
kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows
Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT Gold and 8.1, and Windows 10 does
not properly constrain impersonation levels, which allows local users
to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka "Win32k Elevation of
Privilege Vulnerability."
