Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.4.1.1 and 0.5.x before 0.5.1.2, when an
application invokes the totalSize method on an object reader, allows
remote peers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a
crafted small message, which triggers a "tight" for loop.  NOTE: this
vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-2312.
