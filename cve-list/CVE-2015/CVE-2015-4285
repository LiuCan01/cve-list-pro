The Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) implementation in Cisco IOS
XR 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.2.1, and 5.2.2 on ASR9k devices makes incorrect
decisions about the opening of TCP and UDP ports during the processing
of flow base entries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (resource consumption) by sending traffic to these ports
continuously, aka Bug ID CSCur88273.
