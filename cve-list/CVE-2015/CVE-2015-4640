The SwiftKey language-pack update implementation on Samsung Galaxy S4,
S4 Mini, S5, and S6 devices relies on an HTTP connection to the
skslm.swiftkey.net server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
write to language-pack files by modifying an HTTP response.  NOTE:
CVE-2015-4640 exploitation can be combined with CVE-2015-4641
exploitation for man-in-the-middle code execution.
