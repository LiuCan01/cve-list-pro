The (1) Service Provider (SP) and (2) Identity Provider (IdP) in
PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure that the Destination attribute
in a Response element in a SAML assertion matches the location from
which the message was received, which allows remote attackers to have
unspecified impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this identifier was
SPLIT from CVE-2015-0277 per ADT2 due to different vulnerability
types.
