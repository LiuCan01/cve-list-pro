Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, when Instant Extended mode is used,
does not properly consider the interaction between the "1993 search"
features and restore-from-disk RELOAD transitions, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to spoof the address bar for a
search-results page by leveraging (1) a compromised search engine or
(2) an XSS vulnerability in a search engine, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2015-1231.
