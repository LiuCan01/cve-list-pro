The xenmem_add_to_physmap_one function in arch/arm/mm.c in Xen 4.5.x,
4.4.x, and earlier does not limit the number of printk console
messages when reporting a failure to retrieve a reference on a foreign
page, which allows remote domains to cause a denial of service by
leveraging permissions to map the memory of a foreign guest.
