Secure Transport in Apple iOS before 8.2, Apple OS X through 10.10.2,
and Apple TV before 7.1 does not properly restrict TLS state
transitions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
cipher-downgrade attacks to EXPORT_RSA ciphers via crafted TLS
traffic, related to the "FREAK" issue, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2015-0204 and CVE-2015-1637.
