IBM WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit 7 before 7007 IF2 and 8 before
8005 IF1 and Integration Toolkit 9 before 9003 IF1 are distributed
with MQ client JAR files that support only weak TLS ciphers, which
might make it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information by sniffing the network during a connection to an
Integration Bus node.
