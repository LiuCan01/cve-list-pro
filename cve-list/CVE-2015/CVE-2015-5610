The RSM (aka RSMWinService) service in SolarWinds N-Able N-Central
before 9.5.1.4514 uses the same password decryption key across
different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote
authenticated users to obtain the cleartext domain-administrator
password by locating the encrypted password within HTML source code
and then leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation.
