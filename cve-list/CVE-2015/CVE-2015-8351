PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in the Gwolle Guestbook plugin
before 1.5.4 for WordPress, when allow_url_include is enabled, allows
remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
the abspath parameter to frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php.  NOTE: this
can also be leveraged to include and execute arbitrary local files via
directory traversal sequences regardless of whether allow_url_include
is enabled.
