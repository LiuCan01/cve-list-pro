The (1) mdare64_48.sys, (2) mdare32_48.sys, (3) mdare32_52.sys, (4)
mdare64_52.sys, and (5) Fortishield.sys drivers in Fortinet
FortiClient before 5.2.4 do not properly restrict access to the API
for management of processes and the Windows registry, which allows
local users to obtain a privileged handle to a PID and possibly have
unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by a 0x2220c8 ioctl call.
