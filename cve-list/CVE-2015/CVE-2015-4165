The snapshot API in Elasticsearch before 1.6.0 when another
application exists on the system that can read Lucene files and
execute code from them, is accessible by the attacker, and the Java VM
on which Elasticsearch is running can write to a location that the
other application can read and execute from, allows remote
authenticated users to write to and create arbitrary snapshot metadata
files, and potentially execute arbitrary code.
