The xsave/xrstor implementation in arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h in the
Linux kernel before 3.19.2 creates certain .altinstr_replacement
pointers and consequently does not provide any protection against
instruction faulting, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (panic) by triggering a fault, as demonstrated by an unaligned
memory operand or a non-canonical address memory operand.
