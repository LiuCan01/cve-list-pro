The Cavium cryptographic-module firmware on Cisco Adaptive Security
Appliance (ASA) devices with software 9.3(3) and 9.4(1.1) does not
verify the AES-GCM Integrity Check Value (ICV) octets, which makes it
easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IPSec and IKEv2
traffic by modifying packet data, aka Bug ID CSCuu66218.
