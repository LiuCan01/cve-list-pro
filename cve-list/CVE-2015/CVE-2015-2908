** DISPUTED ** Mobile Devices (aka MDI) C4 OBD-II dongles with
firmware 2.x and 3.4.x, as used in Metromile Pulse and other products,
do not validate firmware updates, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code by specifying an update server.  NOTE: the
vendor states "This was a flaw for the developer/debugging devices,
and was fixed in production version about 3 years ago."
