The TLS implementation in the Cavium cryptographic-module firmware, as
distributed with Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
9.1(5.21) and other products, does not verify the MAC field, which
allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof TLS content by modifying
packets, aka Bug ID CSCuu52976.
