The ngsniffer_process_record function in wiretap/ngsniffer.c in the
Sniffer file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before
2.0.1 does not validate the relationships between record lengths and
record header lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted
file.
