The Authentication Proxy feature in Cisco IOS does not properly handle
invalid AAA return codes from RADIUS and TACACS+ servers, which allows
remote attackers to bypass authentication in opportunistic
circumstances via a connection attempt that triggers an invalid code,
as demonstrated by a connection attempt with a blank password, aka Bug
IDs CSCuo09400 and CSCun16016.
