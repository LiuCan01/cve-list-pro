The Login Disable module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.1 and 7.x-1.x before
7.x-1.2 for Drupal does not properly load the user_logout function,
which allows remote attackers to bypass the logout protection
mechanism by leveraging a contributed user authentication module, as
demonstrated by the CAS and URL Login modules.
