The DragImage::create function in platform/DragImage.cpp in Blink, as
used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, does not initialize memory
for image drawing, which allows remote attackers to have an
unspecified impact by triggering a failed image decoding, as
demonstrated by an image for which the default orientation cannot be
used.
