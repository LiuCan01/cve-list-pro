Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.262 and 14.x through 16.x before
16.0.0.287 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.438 on Linux does
not properly restrict discovery of memory addresses, which allows
attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism on Windows, and have
an unspecified impact on other platforms, via unknown vectors, as
exploited in the wild in January 2015.
