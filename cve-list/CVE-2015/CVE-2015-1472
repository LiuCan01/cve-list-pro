The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka
glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size
during memory allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to
cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a long line containing wide characters
that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.
