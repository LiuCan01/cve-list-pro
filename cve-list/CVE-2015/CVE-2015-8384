PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the /(?J)(?'d'(?'d'g{d}))/ pattern and
related patterns with certain recursive back references, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular
expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered
by Konqueror, a related issue to CVE-2015-8392 and CVE-2015-8395.
