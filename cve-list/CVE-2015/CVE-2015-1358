The remote-management module in the (1) Multi Panels, (2) Comfort
Panels, and (3) RT Advanced functionality in Siemens SIMATIC WinCC
(TIA Portal) before 13 SP1 and in the (4) panels and (5) runtime
functionality in SIMATIC WinCC flexible before 2008 SP3 Up7 does not

remote attackers to determine cleartext credentials by sniffing the
network and conducting a decryption attack.
