With Cloud Foundry Runtime cf-release versions v209 or earlier, UAA
Standalone versions 2.2.6 or earlier and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Runtime
1.4.5 or earlier the change_email form in UAA is vulnerable to a CSRF
attack. This allows an attacker to trigger an e-mail change for a user
logged into a cloud foundry instance via a malicious link on a
attacker controlled site. This vulnerability is applicable only when
using the UAA internal user store for authentication. Deployments
enabled for integration via SAML or LDAP are not affected.
