Under some situations, the Spring Framework 4.2.0 to 4.2.1, 4.0.0 to
4.1.7, 3.2.0 to 3.2.14 and older unsupported versions is vulnerable to
a Reflected File Download (RFD) attack. The attack involves a
malicious user crafting a URL with a batch script extension that
results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered and also
includes some input reflected in the response.
