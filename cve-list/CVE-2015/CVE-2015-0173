The HTTP connection-management functionality in Internet Pass-Thru
(IPT) before 2.1.0.2 in IBM WebSphere MQ, when HTTPS is disabled, does
not properly generate MQIPT Session IDs, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions on MQ message data by
predicting an ID value.
