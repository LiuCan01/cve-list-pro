Reference: URL:http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151117-firepower4

The web interface in Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System
1.1(1.160) on Firepower 9000 devices does not properly restrict use of
IFRAME elements, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
clickjacking attacks and unspecified other attacks via a crafted web
site, aka Bug ID CSCux10604.
