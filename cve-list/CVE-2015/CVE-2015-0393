Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Applications DBA component in
Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.2, 12.2.3, and
12.2.4 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to DB
Privileges.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2015
CPU. Oracle has not commented on the researcher's claim that the
PUBLIC role is granted the INDEX privilege for the DUAL table during a
"seeded install," which allows remote authenticated users to gain
SYSDBA privileges and execute arbitrary code.
