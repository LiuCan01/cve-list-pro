The CryptProtectMemory function in cng.sys (aka the Cryptography Next
Generation driver) in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows
Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2
SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold
and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1, when the
CRYPTPROTECTMEMORY_SAME_LOGON option is used, does not check an
impersonation token's level, which allows local users to bypass
intended decryption restrictions by leveraging a service that (1) has
a named-pipe planting vulnerability or (2) uses world-readable shared
memory for encrypted data, aka "CNG Security Feature Bypass
Vulnerability" or MSRC ID 20707.
