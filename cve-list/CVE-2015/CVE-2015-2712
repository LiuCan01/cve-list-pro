The asm.js implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not
properly determine heap lengths during identification of cases in
which bounds checking may be safely skipped, which allows remote
attackers to trigger out-of-bounds write operations and possibly
execute arbitrary code, or trigger out-of-bounds read operations and
possibly obtain sensitive information from process memory, via crafted
JavaScript.
