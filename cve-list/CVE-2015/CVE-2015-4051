Beckhoff IPC Diagnostics before 1.8 does not properly restrict access
to functions in /config, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (reboot or shutdown), create arbitrary users, or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted request, as
demonstrated by a beckhoff.com:service:cxconfig:1#Write SOAP action to
/upnpisapi.
