The JSONP endpoint in the Studio component in OrientDB Server
Community Edition before 2.0.15 and 2.1.x before 2.1.1 does not
properly restrict callback values, which allows remote attackers to
conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and obtain
sensitive information, via a crafted HTTP request.
