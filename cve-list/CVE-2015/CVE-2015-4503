The TCP Socket API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0

navigator.mozTCPSocket.open method call and send method calls, which
allows remote TCP servers to obtain sensitive information from process
memory by reading packet data, as demonstrated by availability of this
API in a Firefox OS application.
