The Page Loading functionality in WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.7,
7.x before 7.1.7, and 8.x before 8.0.7, as used in Apple iOS before
8.4 and other products, does not properly consider redirects during
decisions about sending an Origin header, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass CSRF protection mechanisms via a crafted
web site.
