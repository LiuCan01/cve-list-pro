The gdImageScaleTwoPass function in gd_interpolation.c in the GD
Graphics Library (aka libgd) before 2.2.0, as used in PHP before
5.6.12, uses inconsistent allocate and free approaches, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via
a crafted call, as demonstrated by a call to the PHP imagescale
function.
