IBM Connections 3.x before 3.0.1.1 CR3, 4.0 before CR4, 4.5 before
CR5, and 5.0 before CR3 does not properly detect recursion during XML
entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (CPU consumption and application crash) via a crafted XML
document containing a large number of nested entity references, a
similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
