Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Manager component
in Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, and
12.2.4 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality and
integrity via vectors related to SQL Extensions.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
third-party claims that this issue is a SQL injection vulnerability,
which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via a request involving the afamexts.sql SQL extension.
