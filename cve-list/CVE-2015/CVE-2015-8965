Rogue Wave JViews before 8.8 patch 21 and 8.9 before patch 1 allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code that exists in the
classpath, such as test code or administration code. The issue exists
because the ilog.views.faces.IlvFacesController servlet in
jviews-framework-all.jar does not require explicit configuration of
servlets that can be called.
