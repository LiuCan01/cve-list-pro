iTerm2 3.x before 3.1.1 allows remote attackers to discover passwords
by reading DNS queries. A new (default) feature was added to iTerm2
version 3.0.0 (and unreleased 2.9.x versions such as 2.9.20150717) that
resulted in a potential information disclosure. In an attempt to see
whether the text under the cursor (or selected text) was a URL, the
text would be sent as an unencrypted DNS query. This has the potential
to result in passwords and other sensitive information being sent in
cleartext without the user being aware.
