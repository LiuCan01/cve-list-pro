The fetchView function in the Mage_Core_Block_Template_Zend class in
Magento Community Edition (CE) 1.9.1.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE)
1.14.1.0 does not restrict the stream wrapper used in a template path,
which allows remote administrators to include and execute arbitrary
PHP files via the phar:// stream wrapper, related to the setScriptPath
function.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege
boundaries, since administrators might already have privileges to
include arbitrary files.
