The tweet_info function in class/__functions.php in the SecureMoz
Security Audit plugin 1.0.5 and earlier for WordPress does not use an
HTTPS session for downloading serialized data, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks
and execute arbitrary PHP code by modifying the client-server data
stream.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
information.
