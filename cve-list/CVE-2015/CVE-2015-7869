Multiple integer overflows in the kernel mode driver for the NVIDIA
GPU graphics driver R340 before 341.92, R352 before 354.35, and R358
before 358.87 on Windows and R304 before 304.131, R340 before 340.96,
R352 before 352.63, and R358 before 358.16 on Linux allow local users
to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (crash), or
possibly gain privileges via unknown vectors, which trigger
uninitialized or out of bounds memory access.  NOTE: this identifier
has been SPLIT per ADT2 and ADT3 due to different vulnerability type
and affected versions. See CVE-2015-8328 for the vulnerability in the
NVAPI support layer in NVIDIA drivers for Windows.
