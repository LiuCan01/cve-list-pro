The Multicast DNS (mDNS) responder in Synology DiskStation Manager
(DSM) before 3.1 inadvertently responds to unicast queries with source
addresses that are not link-local, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) or obtain
potentially sensitive information via port-5353 UDP packets to the
Avahi component.
