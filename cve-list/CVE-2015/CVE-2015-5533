SQL injection vulnerability in counter-options.php in the Count Per
Day plugin before 3.4.1 for WordPress allows remote authenticated
administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the
cpd_keep_month parameter to wp-admin/options-general.php.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands.
