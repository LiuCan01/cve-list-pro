The ff_frame_thread_init function in libavcodec/pthread_frame.c in
FFmpeg before 2.7.2 mishandles certain memory-allocation failures,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid
pointer access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted file, as demonstrated by an AVI file.
