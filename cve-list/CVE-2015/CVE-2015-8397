The JPEGLSCodec::DecodeExtent function in
MediaStorageAndFileFormat/gdcmJPEGLSCodec.cxx in Grassroots DICOM (aka
GDCM) before 2.6.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information from process memory or cause a denial of service
(application crash) via an embedded JPEG-LS image with dimensions
larger than the selected region in a (1) two-dimensional or (2)
three-dimensional DICOM image file, which triggers an out-of-bounds
read.
