The remote-support feature on Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance
(WSAv), Email Security Virtual Appliance (ESAv), and Security
Management Virtual Appliance (SMAv) devices before 2015-06-25 uses the
same default SSH root authorized key across different customers'
installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
authentication by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another
installation, aka Bug IDs CSCuu95988, CSCuu95994, and CSCuu96630.
