Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle iSupplier Portal component in
Oracle E-Business Suite 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, and 12.2.4 allows
remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and
availability via vectors related to XML input.  NOTE: the previous
information is from the October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
third-party claims that this issue is an XML External Entity (XXE)
vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files,
cause a denial of service, or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a crafted
DTD in an XML request to OA_HTML/oramipp_lpr.
