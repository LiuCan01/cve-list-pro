The detect_version function in wiretap/logcat.c in the Android Logcat
file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not check the
length of the payload, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a packet
with a crafted payload, as demonstrated by a length of zero, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3906.
