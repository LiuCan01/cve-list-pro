The WebUI component in Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance SV800,
SV1800, SV2800, and SV3800 3.6.x through 3.8.x before 3.8.4 does not
set the secure flag for the administrator's cookie in an https
session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this
cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2015-4138.
