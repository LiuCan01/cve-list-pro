Multiple off-by-one errors in fpdfapi/fpdf_font/font_int.h in PDFium,
as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document, related to an
"intra-object-overflow" issue, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2015-1205.
