** DISPUTED ** The CAPWAP DTLS protocol implementation in Fortinet
FortiOS 5.0 Patch 7 build 4457 uses the same certificate and private
key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier
for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the
Fortinet_Factory certificate and private key.  NOTE: FG-IR-15-002 says
"The Fortinet_Factory certificate is unique to each device ... An
attacker cannot therefore stage a MitM attack."
