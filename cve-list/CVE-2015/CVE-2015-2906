** DISPUTED ** Mobile Devices (aka MDI) C4 OBD-II dongles with
firmware 2.x and 3.4.x, as used in Metromile Pulse and other products,
store SSH private keys that are the same across different customers'
installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
access by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another
installation.  NOTE: the vendor states "This was a flaw for the
developer/debugging devices (again not possible in production
versions)."
