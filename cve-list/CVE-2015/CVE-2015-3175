Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in Moodle through 2.5.9, 2.6.x
before 2.6.11, 2.7.x before 2.7.8, and 2.8.x before 2.8.6 allow remote
attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct
phishing attacks via vectors involving an error page that links to a
URL from an HTTP Referer header.
