The read_request_line function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP
Server 2.4.12 does not initialize the protocol structure member, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and process crash) by sending a request that lacks a
method to an installation that enables the INCLUDES filter and has an
ErrorDocument 400 directive specifying a local URI.
