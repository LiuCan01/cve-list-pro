phpMyBackupPro before 2.5 does not validate integer input, which
allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code by
injecting scripts via the path, filename, and period parameters to
scheduled.php, and making requests to injected scripts, or by
injecting PHP into a PHP configuration variable via a PHP variable
variable.
