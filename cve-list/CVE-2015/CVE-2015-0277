The Service Provider (SP) in PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure
that it is a member of an Audience element when an AudienceRestriction
is specified, which allows remote attackers to log in to other users'
accounts via a crafted SAML assertion.  NOTE: this identifier has been
SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. See CVE-2015-6254
for lack of validation for the Destination attribute in a Response
element in a SAML assertion.
