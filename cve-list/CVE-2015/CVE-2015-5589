The phar_convert_to_other function in ext/phar/phar_object.c in PHP
before 5.4.43, 5.5.x before 5.5.27, and 5.6.x before 5.6.11 does not
validate a file pointer before a close operation, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TAR archive that
is mishandled in a Phar::convertToData call.
