The (1) IsVolumeAccessibleByCurrentUser and (2) MountDevice methods in
Ntdriver.c in TrueCrypt 7.0, VeraCrypt before 1.15, and CipherShed,
when running on Windows, do not check the impersonation level of
impersonation tokens, which allows local users to impersonate a user
at SecurityIdentify level and gain access to other users' mounted
encrypted volumes.
