Apple Mac EFI before 2015-001, as used in OS X before 10.10.4 and
other products, does not properly set refresh rates for DDR3 RAM,
which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct row-hammer
attacks, and consequently gain privileges or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption), by triggering certain patterns of access to
memory locations.
