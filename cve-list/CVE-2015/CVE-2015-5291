Heap-based buffer overflow in PolarSSL 1.x before 1.2.17 and ARM mbed
TLS (formerly PolarSSL) 1.3.x before 1.3.14 and 2.x before 2.1.2
allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service (client crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long hostname to the server
name indication (SNI) extension, which is not properly handled when
creating a ClientHello message.  NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT
per ADT3 due to different affected version ranges. See CVE-2015-8036
for the session ticket issue that was introduced in 1.3.0.
