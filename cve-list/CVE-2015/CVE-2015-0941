The Inetc plugin for Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), as
used in CERT/CC Failure Observation Engine (FOE) and other products,
does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and possibly execute
arbitrary code by sending a crafted certificate in a download session
for Windows executable files.
