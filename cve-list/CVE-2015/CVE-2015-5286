OpenStack Image Service (Glance) before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x
before 2015.1.2 (kilo) allows remote authenticated users to bypass the
storage quota and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by
deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that expires
during the process.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-9623.
