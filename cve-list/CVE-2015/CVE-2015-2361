Hyper-V in Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 does not
properly initialize guest OS system data structures, which allows
guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS or cause a
denial of service (buffer overflow) by leveraging guest OS privileges,
aka "Hyper-V Buffer Overflow Vulnerability."
