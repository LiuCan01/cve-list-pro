A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the Cloud Foundry
component Cloud Controller that affects cf-release versions prior to
v208 and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime versions prior to
1.4.2. Path traversal is the 'outbreak' of a given directory structure
through relative file paths in the user input. It aims at accessing
files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder, for
disallowed reading or even executing arbitrary system commands. An
attacker could use a certain parameter of the file path for instance
to inject '../' sequences in order to navigate through the file
system. In this particular case a remote authenticated attacker can
exploit the identified vulnerability in order to upload arbitrary
files to the server running a Cloud Controller instance - outside the
isolated application container.
