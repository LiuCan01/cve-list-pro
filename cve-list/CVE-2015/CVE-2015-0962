Barracuda Web Filter 7.x and 8.x before 8.1.0.005, when SSL Inspection
is enabled, uses the same root Certification Authority certificate
across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL
sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship.
