Seagate ST500LT015 hard disk drives, when operating in eDrive mode on
Lenovo ThinkPad W541 laptops with BIOS 2.21, allow physically
proximate attackers to bypass self-encrypting drive (SED) protection
by attaching a second SATA connector to exposed pins, maintaining an
alternate power source, and attaching the data cable to another
machine, aka a "Hot Unplug Attack."
