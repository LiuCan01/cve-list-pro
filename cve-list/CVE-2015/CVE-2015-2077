The SDK for Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor, as used in Lavasoft
Ad-Aware Web Companion 1.1.885.1766 and Ad-Aware AdBlocker (alpha)
1.3.69.1, Qustodio for Windows, Atom Security, Inc. StaffCop 5.8, and
other products, uses the same X.509 certificate private key for a root
CA certificate across different customers' installations, which makes
it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by
leveraging knowledge of this key, as originally reported for Superfish
VisualDiscovery on certain Lenovo Notebook laptop products.
