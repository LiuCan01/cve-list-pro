An integer overflow can occur in NTP-dev.4.3.70 leading to an
out-of-bounds memory copy operation when processing a specially
crafted private mode packet. The crafted packet needs to have the
correct message authentication code and a valid timestamp. When
processed by the NTP daemon, it leads to an immediate crash.
