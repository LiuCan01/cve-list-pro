The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier supports the rsa_fixed_dh,
dss_fixed_dh, rsa_fixed_ecdh, and ecdsa_fixed_ecdh values for
ClientCertificateType but does not directly document the ability to
compute the master secret in certain situations with a client secret
key and server public key but not a server secret key, which makes it
easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof TLS servers by
leveraging knowledge of the secret key for an arbitrary installed
client X.509 certificate, aka the "Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI)"
issue.
