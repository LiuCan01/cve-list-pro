SChannel in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and
R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012
Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 lacks the required extended
master-secret binding support to ensure that a server's X.509
certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before
renegotiation, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain
sensitive information or modify TLS session data via a "triple
handshake attack," aka "Schannel TLS Triple Handshake Vulnerability."
