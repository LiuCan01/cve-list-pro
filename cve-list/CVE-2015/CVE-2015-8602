The Token Insert Entity module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.1 for Drupal does
not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated
users with certain permissions to bypass intended access restrictions
and possibly obtain sensitive information by inserting a token, which
embeds a rendered entity in the main node.
