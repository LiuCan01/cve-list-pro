phpMyBackupPro 2.5 and earlier does not properly escape the "."
character in request parameters, which allows remote authenticated
users with knowledge of a web-accessible and web-writeable directory
on the target system to inject and execute arbitrary PHP scripts by
injecting scripts via the path, filename, and dirs parameters to
scheduled.php, and making requests to injected scripts.
