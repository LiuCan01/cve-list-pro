The version checking subroutine in percona-toolkit before 2.2.13 and
xtrabackup before 2.2.9 was vulnerable to silent HTTP downgrade
attacks and Man In The Middle attacks in which the server response
could be modified to allow the attacker to respond with modified
command payload and have the client return additional running
configuration information leading to an information disclosure of
running configuration of MySQL.
