The NaClSandbox::InitializeLayerTwoSandbox function in
components/nacl/loader/sandbox_linux/nacl_sandbox_linux.cc in Google
Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not have RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_DATA
limits for Native Client (aka NaCl) processes, which might make it
easier for remote attackers to conduct row-hammer attacks or have
unspecified other impact by leveraging the ability to run a crafted
program in the NaCl sandbox.
