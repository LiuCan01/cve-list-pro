Basware Banking (Maksuliikenne) before 9.10.0.0 does not encrypt
communication between the client and the backend server, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain encryption keys, user
credentials, and other sensitive information by sniffing the network
or modify this traffic by inserting packets into the client-server
data stream.
