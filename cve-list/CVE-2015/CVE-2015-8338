Xen 4.6.x and earlier does not properly enforce limits on page order
inputs for the (1) XENMEM_increase_reservation, (2)
XENMEM_populate_physmap, (3) XENMEM_exchange, and possibly other
HYPERVISOR_memory_op suboperations, which allows ARM guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption, guest
reboot, or watchdog timeout and host reboot) and possibly have
unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
