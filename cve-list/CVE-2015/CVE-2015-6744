Basware Banking (Maksuliikenne) before 8.90.07.X relies on the client
to enforce (1) login verification, (2) audit trail creation, and (3)
account locking, which allows remote attackers to "disrupt
security-critical functions" by "dropping network traffic." NOTE: this
identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-0942 per ADT2 and ADT3 due to
different vulnerability type and different affected versions.
