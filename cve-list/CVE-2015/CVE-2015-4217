The remote-support feature on Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance
(WSAv), Email Security Virtual Appliance (ESAv), and Security
Management Virtual Appliance (SMAv) devices before 2015-06-25 uses the
same default SSH host keys across different customers' installations,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of a private key from
another installation, aka Bug IDs CSCus29681, CSCuu95676, and
CSCuu96601.
