The default configuration of SGOS in Blue Coat ProxySG before
6.2.16.5, 6.5 before 6.5.7.1, and 6.6 before 6.6.2.1 forwards
authentication challenges from upstream origin content servers (OCS)
when used in an explicit proxy deployment, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a 407 (aka Proxy
Authentication Required) HTTP status code, as demonstrated when using
NTLM authentication.
