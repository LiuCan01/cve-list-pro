Doctrine Annotations before 1.2.7, Cache before 1.3.2 and 1.4.x before
1.4.2, Common before 2.4.3 and 2.5.x before 2.5.1, ORM before 2.4.8 or
2.5.x before 2.5.1, MongoDB ODM before 1.0.2, and MongoDB ODM Bundle
before 3.0.1 use world-writable permissions for cache directories,
which allows local users to execute arbitrary PHP code with additional
privileges by leveraging an application with the umask set to 0 and
that executes cache entries as code.
