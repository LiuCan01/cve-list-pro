EMC RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite (MES) 4.0.x before 4.0.8 and 4.1.x
before 4.1.3 and RSA BSAFE SSL-C 2.8.9 and earlier do not properly
restrict TLS state transitions, which makes it easier for remote
attackers to conduct cipher-downgrade attacks to EXPORT_RSA ciphers
via crafted TLS traffic, related to the "FREAK" issue, a similar issue
to CVE-2015-0204.
