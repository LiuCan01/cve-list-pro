Adserver before 3.2.2 allow remote attackers to hijack the
authentication of users for requests that (1) perform certain plugin
actions and possibly cause a denial of service (disabled core plugins)
via unknown vectors or (2) change the contact name and language or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted POST request to
an account-user-*.php script.
