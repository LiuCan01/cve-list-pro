The pcre_exec function in pcre_exec.c in PCRE before 8.38 mishandles a
// pattern with a 01 string, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as
demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
