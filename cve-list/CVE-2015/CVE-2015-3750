WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x before
8.0.8, as used in iOS before 8.4.1 and other products, does not
enforce the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protection mechanism
for Content Security Policy (CSP) report requests, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information by
sniffing the network or spoof a report by modifying the client-server
data stream.
