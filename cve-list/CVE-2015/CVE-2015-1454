Blue Coat ProxyClient before 3.3.3.3 and 3.4.x before 3.4.4.10 and
Unified Agent before 4.1.3.151952 does not properly validate certain
certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
ProxySG Client Managers, and consequently modify configurations and
execute arbitrary software updates, via a crafted certificate.
