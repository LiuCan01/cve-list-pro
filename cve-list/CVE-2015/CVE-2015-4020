RubyGems 2.0.x before 2.0.17, 2.2.x before 2.2.5, and 2.4.x before 2.4.8
does not validate the hostname when fetching gems or making API
requests, which allows remote attackers to redirect requests to
arbitrary domains via a crafted DNS SRV record with a domain that is
suffixed with the original domain name, aka a "DNS hijack attack." NOTE:
this vulnerability exists because to an incomplete fix for
CVE-2015-3900.
