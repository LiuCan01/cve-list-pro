Microsoft SQL Server 2008 SP3 and SP4, 2008 R2 SP2 and SP3, 2012 SP1
and SP2, and 2014, when transactional replication is configured, does
not prevent use of uninitialized memory in unspecified function calls,
which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by
leveraging certain permissions and making a crafted query, as
demonstrated by the VIEW SERVER STATE permission, aka "SQL Server
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
