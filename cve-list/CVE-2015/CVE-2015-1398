Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Magento Community
Edition (CE) 1.9.1.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE) 1.14.1.0 allow remote
authenticated users to include and execute certain PHP files via (1)
.. (dot dot) sequences in the PATH_INFO to index.php or (2) vectors
involving a block value in the ___directive parameter to the
Cms_Wysiwyg controller in the Adminhtml module, related to the
blockDirective function and the auto loading mechanism.  NOTE: vector 2
might not cross privilege boundaries, since administrators might
already have the privileges to execute code and upload files.
