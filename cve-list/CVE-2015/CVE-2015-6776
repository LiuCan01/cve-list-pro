The opj_dwt_decode_1* functions in dwt.c in OpenJPEG, as used in
PDFium in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data that is
mishandled during a discrete wavelet transform.
