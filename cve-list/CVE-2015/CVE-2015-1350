The VFS subsystem in the Linux kernel 3.x provides an incomplete set
of requirements for setattr operations that underspecifies removing
extended privilege attributes, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (capability stripping) via a failed invocation of a
system call, as demonstrated by using chown to remove a capability
from the ping or Wireshark dumpcap program.
