Unspecified vulnerability in Uconnect before 15.26.1, as used in
certain Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) from 2013 to 2015 models,
allows remote attackers in the same cellular network to control
vehicle movement, cause human harm or physical damage, or modify
dashboard settings via vectors related to modification of
entertainment-system firmware and access of the CAN bus due to
insufficient "Radio security protection," as demonstrated on a 2014
Jeep Cherokee Limited FWD.
