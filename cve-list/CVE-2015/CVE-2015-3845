The Parcel::appendFrom function in libs/binder/Parcel.cpp in Binder in
Android before 5.1.1 LMY48M does not consider parcel boundaries during
identification of binder objects in an append operation, which allows
attackers to obtain a different application's privileges via a crafted
application, aka internal bug 17312693.
