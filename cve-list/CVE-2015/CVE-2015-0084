The Task Scheduler in Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2
SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and
Windows RT Gold and 8.1 does not properly constrain impersonation
levels, which allows local users to bypass intended restrictions on
launching executable files via a crafted task, aka "Task Scheduler
Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability."
