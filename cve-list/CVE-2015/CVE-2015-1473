The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka
glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size
during a risk-management decision for use of the alloca function,
which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
service (segmentation violation) or overwrite memory locations beyond
the stack boundary via a long line containing wide characters that are
improperly handled in a wscanf call.
