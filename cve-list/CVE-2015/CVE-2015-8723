The AirPDcapPacketProcess function in epan/crypt/airpdcap.c in the
802.11 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before
2.0.1 does not validate the relationship between the total length and
the capture length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a
crafted packet.
