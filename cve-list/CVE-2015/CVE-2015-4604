The mget function in softmagic.c in file 5.x, as used in the Fileinfo
component in PHP before 5.4.40, 5.5.x before 5.5.24, and 5.6.x before
5.6.8, does not properly maintain a certain pointer relationship,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
string that is mishandled by a "Python script text executable" rule.
