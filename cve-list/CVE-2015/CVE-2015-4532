EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7SP1 P32, 6.7SP2 before P25,
7.0 before P19, 7.1 before P16, and 7.2 before P02 does not properly
check authorization and does not properly restrict object types, which
allows remote authenticated users to run save RPC commands with
super-user privileges, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2514.
