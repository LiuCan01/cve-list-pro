The eshop_checkout function in checkout.php in the Wordpress Eshop
plugin 6.3.11 and earlier does not validate variables in the
"eshopcart" HTTP cookie, which allows remote attackers to perform
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or a path disclosure attack via
crafted variables named after target PHP variables.
