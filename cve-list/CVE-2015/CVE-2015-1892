The Multicast DNS (mDNS) responder in IBM Security Access Manager for
Web 7.x before 7.0.0 FP12 and 8.x before 8.0.1 FP1 inadvertently
responds to unicast queries with source addresses that are not
link-local, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(traffic amplification) or obtain potentially sensitive information
via port-5353 UDP packets.
