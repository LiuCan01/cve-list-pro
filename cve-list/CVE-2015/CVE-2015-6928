classes/admin.class.php in CubeCart 5.2.12 through 5.2.16 and 6.x
before 6.0.7 does not properly validate that a password reset request
was made, which allows remote attackers to change the administrator
password via a recovery request with a space character in the validate
parameter and the administrator email in the email parameter.
