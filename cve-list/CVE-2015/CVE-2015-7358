The IsDriveLetterAvailable method in Driver/Ntdriver.c in TrueCrypt
7.0, VeraCrypt before 1.15, and CipherShed, when running on Windows,
does not properly validate drive letter symbolic links, which allows
local users to mount an encrypted volume over an existing drive letter
and gain privileges via an entry in the /GLOBAL?? directory.
