Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Search app
in Gaia in Mozilla Firefox OS before 2.2 allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary HTML via the (1) name or (2) title field in card
content associated with a search link that is mishandled after a HOME
button press or a Show Windows action, as demonstrated by embedding an
arbitrary application or spoofing the account-creation page.
