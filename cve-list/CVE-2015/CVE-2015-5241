After logging into the portal, the logout jsp page redirects the
browser back to the login page after. It is feasible for malicious
users to redirect the browser to an unintended web page in Apache
jUDDI 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 when utilizing the portlets based
user interface also known as 'Pluto', 'jUDDI Portal', 'UDDI Portal' or
'uddi-console'. User session data, credentials, and auth tokens are
cleared before the redirect.
