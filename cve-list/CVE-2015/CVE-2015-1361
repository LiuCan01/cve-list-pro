platform/image-decoders/ImageFrame.h in Blink, as used in Google
Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not initialize a variable that is
used in calls to the Skia SkBitmap::setAlphaType function, which might
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML document, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2015-1205.
