The Juniper SRX Series services gateways with Junos OS 12.1X46 before
12.1X46-D35, 12.1X47 before 12.1X47-D25, and 12.3X48 before
12.3X48-D15 do not properly implement the "set system ports console
insecure" feature, which allows physically proximate attackers to gain
administrative privileges by leveraging access to the console port.
