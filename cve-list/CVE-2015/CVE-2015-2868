An exploitable remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Trane
ComfortLink II firmware version 2.0.2 in DSS service. An attacker who
can connect to the DSS service on the Trane ComfortLink II device can
send an overly long REG request that can overflow a fixed size stack
buffer, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
