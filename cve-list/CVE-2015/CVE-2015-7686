Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Address.pm in the
Email-Address module 1.908 and earlier for Perl allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted
string containing a list of e-mail addresses in conjunction with
parenthesis characters that can be associated with nested comments.
NOTE: the default configuration in 1.908 mitigates this vulnerability
but misparses certain realistic comments.
