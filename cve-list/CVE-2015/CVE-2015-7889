The SecEmailComposer/EmailComposer application in the Samsung S6 Edge
before the October 2015 MR uses weak permissions for the
com.samsung.android.email.intent.action.QUICK_REPLY_BACKGROUND service
action, which might allow remote attackers with knowledge of the local
email address to obtain sensitive information via a crafted
application that sends a crafted intent.
