The NETLOGON service in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows
Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, when
a Domain Controller is configured, allows remote attackers to spoof
the computer name of a secure channel's endpoint, and obtain sensitive
session information, by running a crafted application and leveraging
the ability to sniff network traffic, aka "NETLOGON Spoofing
Vulnerability."
