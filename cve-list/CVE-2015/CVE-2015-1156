The page-loading implementation in WebKit, as used in Apple Safari
before 6.2.6, 7.x before 7.1.6, and 8.x before 8.0.6, does not
properly handle the rel attribute in an A element, which allows remote
attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy for a link's target, and
spoof the user interface, via a crafted web site.
