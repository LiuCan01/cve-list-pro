The decompose function in platform/transforms/TransformationMatrix.cpp
in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, does not
verify that a matrix inversion succeeded, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access
and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
crafted web site.
