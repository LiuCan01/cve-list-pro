The kernel in Microsoft Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012
Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 does not properly validate an
unspecified address, which allows local users to bypass the KASLR
protection mechanism, and consequently discover the cng.sys base
address, via a crafted application, aka "Windows Kernel Security
Feature Bypass Vulnerability."
