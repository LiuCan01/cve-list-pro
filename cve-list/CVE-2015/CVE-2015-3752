The Content Security Policy implementation in WebKit in Apple Safari
before 6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x before 8.0.8, as used in iOS
before 8.4.1 and other products, does not properly restrict cookie
transmission for report requests, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information via vectors involving (1) a cross-origin
request or (2) a private-browsing request.
