agent/Core/Controller/SendRequest.cpp in Phusion Passenger before
4.0.60 and 5.0.x before 5.0.22, when used in Apache integration mode
or in standalone mode without a filtering proxy, allows remote
attackers to spoof headers passed to applications by using an _
(underscore) character instead of a - (dash) character in an HTTP
header, as demonstrated by an X_User header.
