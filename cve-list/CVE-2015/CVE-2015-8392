PCRE before 8.38 mishandles certain instances of the (?| substring,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (unintended
recursion and buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a
JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror, a related issue to
CVE-2015-8384 and CVE-2015-8395.
