The Reader mode feature in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0.1 on Android,
and Desktop Firefox pre-release, does not properly handle privileged
URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary
JavaScript code with chrome privileges by leveraging the ability to
bypass the Same Origin Policy.
