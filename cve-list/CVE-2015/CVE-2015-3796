The TRE library in Libc in Apple iOS before 8.4.1 and OS X before
10.10.5 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)
via a crafted regular expression, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2015-3797 and CVE-2015-3798.
