The Integrated Management Controller on Cisco Unified Computing System
(UCS) C servers with software 1.5(3) and 1.6(0.16) has a default SSL
certificate, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to
bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of
a private key, aka Bug IDs CSCum56133 and CSCum56177.
