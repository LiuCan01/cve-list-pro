PHP before 5.4.42, 5.5.x before 5.5.26, and 5.6.x before 5.6.10 does
not ensure that pathnames lack %00 sequences, which might allow remote
attackers to read or write to arbitrary files via crafted input to an
application that calls (1) a DOMDocument save method or (2) the GD
imagepsloadfont function, as demonstrated by a filename0.html attack
that bypasses an intended configuration in which client users may
write to only .html files.
