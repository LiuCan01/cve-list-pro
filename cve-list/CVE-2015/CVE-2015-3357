Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Wishlist module before
6.x-2.7 and 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.7 for Drupal allows remote
authenticated users with the "access wishlists" permission to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors, which are not
properly handled in a log message.
