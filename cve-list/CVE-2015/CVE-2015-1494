The FancyBox for WordPress plugin before 3.0.3 for WordPress does not
properly restrict access, which allows remote attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an mfbfw[*] parameter in an
update action to wp-admin/admin-post.php, as demonstrated by the
mfbfw[padding] parameter and exploited in the wild in February 2015.
