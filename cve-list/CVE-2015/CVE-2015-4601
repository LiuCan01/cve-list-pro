PHP before 5.6.7 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an
unexpected data type, related to "type confusion" issues in (1)
ext/soap/php_encoding.c, (2) ext/soap/php_http.c, and (3)
ext/soap/soap.c, a different issue than CVE-2015-4600.
