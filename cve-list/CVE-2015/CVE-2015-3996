The default AFSecurityPolicy.validatesDomainName configuration for
AFSSLPinningModeNone in the AFNetworking framework before 2.5.3, as
used in the ownCloud iOS Library, disables verification of a server
hostname against the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of
the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
