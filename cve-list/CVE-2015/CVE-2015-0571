The WLAN (aka Wi-Fi) driver for the Linux kernel 3.x and 4.x, as used
in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM
devices and other products, does not verify authorization for private
SET IOCTL calls, which allows attackers to gain privileges via a
crafted application, related to wlan_hdd_hostapd.c and
wlan_hdd_wext.c.
