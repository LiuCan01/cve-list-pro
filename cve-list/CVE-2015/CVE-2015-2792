The WPML plugin before 3.1.9 for WordPress does not properly handle
multiple actions in a request, which allows remote attackers to bypass
nonce checks and perform arbitrary actions via a request containing an
action POST parameter, an action GET parameter, and a valid nonce for
the action GET parameter.
