Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 on Android does not properly restrict
writing URL data to the Android logging system, which allows attackers
to obtain sensitive information via a crafted application that has a
required permission for reading a log, as demonstrated by the
READ_LOGS permission for the mixed-content violation log on Android
4.0 and earlier.
