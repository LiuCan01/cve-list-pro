Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Microsoft Internet
Explorer 9 through 11 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same
Origin Policy and inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors
involving an IFRAME element that triggers a redirect, a second IFRAME
element that does not trigger a redirect, and an eval of a WindowProxy
object, aka "Universal XSS (UXSS)."
