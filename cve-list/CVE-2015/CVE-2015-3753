WebKit in Apple Safari before 6.2.8, 7.x before 7.1.8, and 8.x before
8.0.8, as used in iOS before 8.4.1 and other products, does not
properly perform taint checking for CANVAS elements, which allows
remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain sensitive
image data by leveraging a redirect to a data:image resource.
