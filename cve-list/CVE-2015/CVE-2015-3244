The Portlet Bridge for JavaServer Faces in Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0,
when used in portlets with the default resource serving for
GenericPortlet, does not properly restrict access to restricted
resources, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information via a URL with a modified resource ID.
