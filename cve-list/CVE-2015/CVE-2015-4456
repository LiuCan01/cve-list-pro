ownCloud Desktop Client before 1.8.2 does not call
QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors with the list of errors to be ignored,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the user's
certificate distrust decision and obtain sensitive information by
leveraging a self-signed certificate and a connection to a server using
its own self-signed certificate.
