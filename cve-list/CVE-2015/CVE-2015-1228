The RenderCounter::updateCounter function in
core/rendering/RenderCounter.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome
before 41.0.2272.76, does not force a relayout operation and
consequently does not initialize memory for a data structure, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequence.
