Open redirect vulnerability in the Overlay module in Drupal 7.x before
7.41, the jQuery Update module 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.7 for Drupal, and
the LABjs module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.8 allows remote attackers to
redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2015-3233.
