Tails before 1.7 includes the wget program but does not prevent
automatic fallback from passive FTP to active FTP, which allows remote
FTP servers to discover the Tor client IP address by reading a (1)
PORT or (2) EPRT command.  NOTE: within wget itself, the automatic
fallback is not considered a vulnerability by CVE.
