The wiki component in Moodle through 2.6.11, 2.7.x before 2.7.10,
2.8.x before 2.8.8, and 2.9.x before 2.9.2 does not consider the
mod/wiki:managefiles capability before authorizing file management,
which allows remote authenticated users to delete arbitrary files by
using a manage-files button in a text editor.
