wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) before 3.6.8 does not properly handle faults
associated with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) process when
allowing ephemeral key exchange without low memory optimizations on a
server, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain private
RSA keys by capturing TLS handshakes, aka a Lenstra attack.
