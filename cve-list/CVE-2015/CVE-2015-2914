Securifi Almond devices with firmware before AL1-R201EXP10-L304-W34
and Almond-2015 devices with firmware before AL2-R088M use a fixed
source-port number in outbound DNS queries performed on behalf of any
device, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof responses
by using this number for the destination port, a different
vulnerability than CVE-2015-7296.
