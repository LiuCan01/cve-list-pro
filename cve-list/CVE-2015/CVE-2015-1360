Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via crafted data that is improperly
handled during text drawing, related to gpu/GrBitmapTextContext.cpp
and gpu/GrDistanceFieldTextContext.cpp, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2015-1205.
