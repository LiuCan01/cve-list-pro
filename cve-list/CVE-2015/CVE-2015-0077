The kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows
Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows
8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold
and 8.1 do not properly initialize function buffers, which allows
local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, and
possibly bypass the ASLR protection mechanism, via a crafted
application, aka "Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure
Vulnerability."
