Atlassian JIRA Software 7.0.3, JIRA Core 7.0.3, and the bundled JIRA
Service Desk 3.0.3 installer attaches the wrong image to e-mail
notifications when a user views an issue with inline wiki markup
referencing an image attachment, which might allow remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information by updating a different issue that
includes wiki markup for an external image reference.
