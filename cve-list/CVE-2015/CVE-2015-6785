The CSPSource::hostMatches function in
WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security
Policy (CSP) implementation in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73
accepts an x.y hostname as a match for a *.x.y pattern, which might
allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in
opportunistic circumstances by leveraging a policy that was intended
to be specific to subdomains.
