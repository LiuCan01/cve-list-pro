PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in the fetchView function in
the Mage_Core_Block_Template_Zend class in Magento Community Edition
(CE) 1.9.1.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE) 1.14.1.0 allows remote
administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in unspecified
vectors involving the setScriptPath function.  NOTE: it is not clear
whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries, since administrators
might already have privileges to include arbitrary files.
