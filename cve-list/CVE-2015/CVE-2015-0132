The XML parser in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation 4.x before 4.0.7
iFix3 and 5.x before 5.0.2 and Rational Requirements Composer 2.x and
3.x before 3.0.1.6 iFix5 and 4.x before 4.0.7 iFix3 does not properly
detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a
crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity
references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
