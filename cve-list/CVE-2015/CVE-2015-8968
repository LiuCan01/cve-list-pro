git-fastclone before 1.0.1 permits arbitrary shell command execution
from .gitmodules. If an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive
clone from a repository they control, they can get a client to run an
arbitrary shell command. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an
unencrypted git clone, they could exploit this. The ext command will be
run if the repository is recursively cloned or if submodules are
updated. This attack works when cloning both local and remote
repositories.
