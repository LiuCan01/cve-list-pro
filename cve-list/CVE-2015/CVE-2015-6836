The SoapClient __call method in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.45,
5.5.x before 5.5.29, and 5.6.x before 5.6.13 does not properly manage
headers, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
crafted serialized data that triggers a "type confusion" in the
serialize_function_call function.
