mod/lti/ajax.php in Moodle through 2.5.9, 2.6.x before 2.6.7, 2.7.x
before 2.7.4, and 2.8.x before 2.8.2 does not consider the
moodle/course:manageactivities and mod/lti:addinstance capabilities
before proceeding with registered-tool list searches, which allows
remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via
requests to the LTI Ajax service.
