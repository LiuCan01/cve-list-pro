Cisco Secure Access Control System before 5.4(0.46.2) and 5.5 before
5.5(0.46) and Cisco Identity Services Engine 1.0(4.573) do not
properly implement access control for support bundles, which allows
remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via
brute-force attempts to send valid credentials, aka Bug IDs CSCue00833
and CSCub40331.
