The VideoFramePool::PoolImpl::CreateFrame function in
media/base/video_frame_pool.cc in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73
does not initialize memory for a video-frame data structure, which
might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds memory access) or possibly have unspecified other
impact by leveraging improper interaction with the vp3_h_loop_filter_c
function in libavcodec/vp3dsp.c in FFmpeg.
