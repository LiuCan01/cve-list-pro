Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.292 and 14.x through 18.x before
18.0.0.160, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.144, Adobe AIR SDK before
18.0.0.144, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.144 on 64-bit
Windows 7 systems do not properly select a random memory address for
the Flash heap, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct
unspecified attacks by predicting this address.
