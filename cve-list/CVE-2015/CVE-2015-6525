Reference: MLIST:[Libevent-users] 20150105 Advisory: integer overflow in evbuffers for Libevent <= 1.4.14b,2.0.21,2.1.4-alpha [CVE-2014-6272]

Reference: URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3119

Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 2.0.x
before 2.0.22 and 2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have other
unspecified impact via "insanely large inputs" to the (1)
evbuffer_add, (2) evbuffer_prepend, (3) evbuffer_expand, (4)
exbuffer_reserve_space, or (5) evbuffer_read function, which triggers
a heap-based buffer overflow or an infinite loop.  NOTE: this
identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2014-6272 per ADT3 due to different
affected versions.
