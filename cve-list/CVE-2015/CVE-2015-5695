Designate 2015.1.0 through 1.0.0.0b1 as packaged in OpenStack Kilo
does not enforce RecordSets per domain, and Records per RecordSet
quotas when processing an internal zone file transfer, which might
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
via a crafted resource record set.
