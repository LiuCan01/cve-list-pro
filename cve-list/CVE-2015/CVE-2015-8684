Reference: MISC:https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/136762/Exponent-CMS-2.3.5-File-Upload-Cross-Site-Scripting.html
Reference: CONFIRM:https://exponentcms.lighthouseapp.com/projects/61783/tickets/1323-exponent-cms-235-file-upload-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability

Exponent CMS before 2.3.7 does not properly restrict the types of
files that can be uploaded, which allows remote attackers to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and possibly have other unspecified
impact as demonstrated by uploading a file with an .html extension,
then accessing it via the elFinder functionality.
