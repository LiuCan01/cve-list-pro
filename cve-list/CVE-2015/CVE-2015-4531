EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7SP1 P32, 6.7SP2 before P25,
7.0 before P19, 7.1 before P16, and 7.2 before P02 does not properly
check authorization for subgroups of privileged groups, which allows
remote authenticated sysadmins to gain super-user privileges, and
bypass intended restrictions on data access and server actions, via
unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4622.
