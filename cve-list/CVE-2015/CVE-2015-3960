The firmware in MNS before 4.5.6 on Belden GarrettCom Magnum 6K and
Magnum 10K switches uses hardcoded RSA private keys and certificates
across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms for
HTTPS sessions by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another
installation.
