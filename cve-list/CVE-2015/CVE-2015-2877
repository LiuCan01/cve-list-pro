** DISPUTED ** Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) in the Linux kernel
2.6.32 through 4.x does not prevent use of a write-timing side
channel, which allows guest OS users to defeat the ASLR protection
mechanism on other guest OS instances via a Cross-VM ASL INtrospection
(CAIN) attack.  NOTE: the vendor states "Basically if you care about
this attack vector, disable deduplication." Share-until-written
approaches for memory conservation among mutually untrusting tenants
are inherently detectable for information disclosure, and can be
classified as potentially misunderstood behaviors rather than
vulnerabilities.
