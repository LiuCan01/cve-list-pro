Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Payments component in Oracle
E-Business Suite 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, and 12.2.4 allows
remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and
availability via unknown vectors related to Punch-in. NOTE: the
previous information is from the October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on third-party claims that this issue is an XML External
Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a crafted DTD in an
XML request to OA_HTML/IspPunchInServlet.
