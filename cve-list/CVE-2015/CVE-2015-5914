The EFI component in Apple OS X before 10.11 allows physically
proximate attackers to modify firmware during the EFI update process
by inserting an Apple Ethernet Thunderbolt adapter with crafted code
in an Option ROM, aka a "Thunderstrike" issue.  NOTE: this issue exists
because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4498.
